# 6.es Executive Summary 
 
Short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) affect climate and are, in most cases, also air pollutants. They include 
aerosols (sulphate, nitrate, ammonium, carbonaceous aerosols, mineral dust and sea spray), which are also 
called particulate matter (PM), and chemically reactive gases (methane, ozone, some halogenated 
compounds, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, non-methane volatile organic compounds, sulphur dioxide 
and ammonia). Except for methane and some halogenated compounds whose lifetimes are about a decade or 
more, SLCFs abundances are highly spatially heterogeneous since they only persist in the atmosphere from a 
few hours to a couple of months. SLCFs are either radiatively active or influence the abundances of 
radiatively active compounds through chemistry (chemical adjustments), and their climate effect occurs 
predominantly in the first two decades after their emission or formation. They can have either a cooling or 
warming effect on climate, and they also affect precipitation and other climate variables. Methane and some 
halogenated compounds are included in climate treaties, unlike the other SLCFs that are nevertheless 
indirectly affected by climate change mitigation since many of them are often co-emitted with CO₂ in 
combustion processes. This chapter assesses the changes, in the past and in a selection of possible futures of 
the emissions and abundances of individual SLCFs primarily on a global and continental scale, and how 
these changes affect the Earth’s energy balance through radiative forcing and feedback in the climate system. 
The attribution of climate and air-quality changes to emission sectors and regions, and the effects of SLCF 
mitigations defined for various environmental purposes, are also assessed.  
 
## Recent Evolution in SLCF Emissions and Abundances  
 
*Over the last decade (2010–2019), strong shifts in the geographical distribution of emissions have led 
to changes in atmospheric abundances of highly variable SLCFs (high confidence). Evidence from 
satellite and surface observations show strong regional variations in trends of ozone (O3), aerosols and 
their precursors (high confidence).* In particular, tropospheric columns of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and 
sulphur dioxide (SO₂) continued to decline over North America and Europe (high confidence) and to increase 
over South Asia (medium confidence), but have declined over East Asia (high confidence). Global carbon 
monoxide (CO) abundance has continued to decline (high confidence). The concentrations of 
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are increasing (high confidence). Global carbonaceous aerosol budgets and 
trends remain poorly characterized due to limited observations, but sites representative of background 
conditions have reported multi-year declines in black carbon (BC) over several regions of the Northern 
Hemisphere. {6.2, 6.3, 2.2.4, 2.2.5, 2.2.6} 
 
*There is no significant trend in the global mean tropospheric concentration of hydroxyl (OH) radical – 
the main sink for many SLCFs, including methane (CH₄) – from 1850 up to around 1980 (low 
confidence) but OH has remained stable or exhibited a positive trend since the 1980s (medium 
confidence).* Global OH cannot be measured directly and is inferred from Earth system and climate 
chemistry models (ESMs, CCMs) constrained by emissions and from observationally constrained inversion 
methods. There is conflicting information from these methods for the 1980–2014 period. ESMs and CCMs 
concur on a positive trend since 1980 (about a 9% increase over 1980–2014) and there is medium confidence 
that this trend is mainly driven by increases in global anthropogenic nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions and 
decreases in anthropogenic CO emissions. The observation-constrained methods suggest either positive 
trends or the absence of trends based on limited evidence and medium agreement. Future changes in global 
OH, in response to SLCF emissions and climate change, will depend on the interplay between multiple 
offsetting drivers of OH. {6.3.6 and Cross-Chapter Box 5.1} 
 
## Effect of SLCFs on Climate and Biogeochemical Cycles 
*Over the historical period, changes in aerosols and their ERF have primarily contributed to a surface 
cooling, partly masking the greenhouse gas driven warming (high confidence).* Radiative forcings 
induced by aerosol changes lead to both local and remote temperature responses (high confidence). The 
temperature response preserves the South-North gradient of the aerosol ERF – hemispherical asymmetry- but 
is more uniform with latitude and is strongly amplified towards the Arctic (medium confidence).  {6.4.1, 
6.4.3} 

*Since the mid-1970s, trends in aerosols and their precursor emissions have led to a shift from an 
increase to a decrease of the magnitude of the negative globally-averaged net aerosol ERF (high 
confidence).* However, the timing of this shift varies by continental-scale region and has not occured for 
some finer regional scales. The spatial and temporal distribution of the net aerosol ERF from 1850 to 2014 is 
highly heterogeneous, with stronger magnitudes in the Northern Hemisphere (high confidence). {6.4.1} 
 
*For forcers with short lifetimes (e.g., months) and not considering chemical adjustments, the response 
in surface temperature occurs strongly as soon as a sustained change in emissions is implemented, and 
that response continues to grow for a few years, primarily due to thermal inertia in the climate system 
(high confidence).* Near its maximum, the response slows down but will then take centuries to reach 
equilibrium (high confidence). For SLCFs with longer lifetimes (e.g., a decade), a delay equivalent to their 
lifetimes is appended to the delay due to thermal inertia (high confidence). {6.6.1} 
 
*Over the 1750-2019 period, changes in SLCF emissions, especially of CH₄, NOx and SO₂, have 
substantial effects on effective radiative forcing (ERF) (high confidence).* The net global emissions-based 
ERF of NOx is negative and that of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) is positive, in 
agreement with the AR5 assessment (high confidence). For methane, the emission-based ERF is twice as 
high as the abundance-based ERF (high confidence) attributed to chemical adjustment mainly via ozone 
production. SO₂ emission changes make the dominant contribution to the ERF from aerosol–cloud 
interactions (high confidence). Over the 1750-2019 period, the contributions from the emitted compounds to 
GSAT changes broadly match their contributions to the ERF (high confidence). Since a peak in emissions-
induced SO₂ ERF has already occurred recently and since there is a delay in the full GSAT response, 
changes in SO₂ emissions have a slightly larger contribution to GSAT change than for CO₂ emissions, 
relative to their respective contributions to ERF. {6.4.2, 6.6.1 and 7.3.5}    
 
*Reactive nitrogen, ozone and aerosols affect terrestrial vegetation and the carbon cycle through 
deposition and effects on large scale radiation (high confidence).* However, the magnitude of these effects 
on the land carbon sink, ecosystem productivity and hence their indirect CO₂ forcing remain uncertain due to 
the difficulty in disentangling the complex interactions between the individual effects. As such, these effects 
are assessed to be of second order in comparison to the direct CO₂ forcing (high confidence), but effects of 
ozone on terrestrial vegetation could add a substantial (positive) forcing compared with the direct ozone 
forcing (low confidence). {6.4.5} 
 
*Climate feedbacks induced from changes in emissions, abundances or lifetimes of SLCFs mediated by 
natural processes or atmospheric chemistry are assessed to have an overall cooling effect (low 
confidence), that is, a total negative feedback parameter, of -0.20 [-0.41 to +0.01] W m−2 °C−1.* These 
non-CO₂ biogeochemical feedbacks are estimated from ESMs, which have advanced since AR5 to include a 
consistent representation of biogeochemical cycles and atmospheric chemistry. However, process-level 
understanding of many chemical and biogeochemical feedbacks involving SLCFs, particularly natural 
emissions, is still emerging, resulting in low confidence in the magnitude and sign of most of SLCF climate 
feedback parameter. {6.2.2, 6.4.5}   
 
## Future Projections for Air Quality Considering Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs)  
 
*Future air quality (in term of surface ozone and PM concentrations) on global to local scales will be 
primarily driven by changes in precursor emissions as opposed to climate change (high confidence) 
and climate change is projected to have mixed effects.* A warmer climate is expected to reduce surface O3 
in regions remote from pollution sources (high confidence) but is expected to increase it by a few parts per 
billion over polluted regions, depending on ozone precursor levels (medium to high confidence). Future 
climate change is expected to have mixed effects, positive or negative, with an overall low effect, on global 
surface PM and more generally on the aerosol global burden (medium confidence), but stronger effects are 
not excluded in regions prone to specific meteorological conditions (low confidence). Overall, there is low 
confidence in the response of surface ozone and PM to future climate change due to the uncertainty in the 
response of the natural processes (e.g., stratosphere–troposphere exchange, natural precursor emissions, 
particularly including biogenic volatile organic compounds, wildfire-emitted precursors, land and marine 
aerosols, and lightning NOx) to climate change. {6.3, 6.5} 

*The SSPs span a wider range of SLCF emissions than the Representative Concentration Pathways, 
representing better the diversity of future options in air pollution management (high confidence).* In 
the SSPs, the socio-economic assumptions and climate mitigation ambition primarily drive future emissions, 
but the SLCF emission trajectories are also steered by varying levels of air pollution control originating from 
the SSP narratives, independently from climate mitigation. Consequently, SSPs consider a large variety of 
regional ambition and effectiveness in implementing air pollution legislation and result in wider range of 
future air pollution levels and SLCF-induced climate effects. {6.7.1} 

*Air pollution projections range from strong reductions in global surface ozone and PM (e.g., SSP1-2.6, 
with strong mitigation of both air pollution and climate change) to no improvement and even 
degradation (e.g., SSP3-7.0 without climate change mitigation and with only weak air pollution 
control) (high confidence).* Under the SSP3-7.0 scenario, PM levels are projected to increase until 2050 
over large parts of Asia, and surface ozone pollution is projected to worsen over all continental areas through 
2100 (high confidence). Without climate change mitigation but with stringent air pollution control (SSP5-
8.5), PM levels decline through 2100, but high methane levels hamper the decline in global surface ozone at 
least until 2080 (high confidence). {6.7.1} 

## Future Projections of the Effect of SLCFs on GSAT in the Core SSPs 

*In the next two decades, it is very likely that the SLCF emission changes in the WG1 core set of SSPs 
will cause a warming relative to 2019, whatever the SSPs, in addition to the warming from long-lived 
greenhouse gases. The net effect of SLCF and HFC changes on GSAT across the SSPs is a likely 
warming of 0.06°C–0.35°C in 2040 relative to 2019. Warming over the next two decades is quite 
similar across the SSPs due to competing effects of warming (methane, ozone) and cooling (aerosols) 
SLCFs.* For the scenarios with the most stringent climate and air pollution mitigations (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-
2.6), the likely near-term warming from the SLCFs is predominantly due to sulphate aerosol reduction, but 
this effect levels off after 2040. In the absence of climate change policies and with weak air pollution control 
(SSP3-7.0), the likely near-term warming due to changes in SLCFs is predominantly due to increases in 
methane, ozone and HFCs, with smaller contributions from changes in aerosols. SSP5-8.5 has the highest 
SLCF-induced warming rates due to warming from methane and ozone increases and reduced aerosols due 
to stronger air pollution control compared to the SSP3-7.0 scenario. {6.7.3}   

*At the end of the century, the large diversity of GSAT response to SLCFs among the scenarios 
robustly covers the possible futures, as the scenarios are internally consistent and span a range from 
very high to very low emissions.* In the scenarios without climate change mitigation (SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5,) 
the likely range of the estimated warming due to SLCFs in 2100 relative to 2019 is 0.4°C–0.9°C {6.7.3, 
6.7.4}. In SSP3-7.0 there is a near-linear warming due to SLCFs of 0.08°C per decade, while for SSP5-8.5 
there is a more rapid warming in the first half of the century. For the scenarios considering the most stringent 
climate and air pollution mitigations (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6), the reduced warming from reductions in 
methane, ozone and HFCs partly balances the warming from reduced aerosols, and the overall SLCF effect is 
a likely increase in GSAT of 0.0°C–0.3°C in 2100, relative to 2019. The SSP2-4.5 scenario (with moderate 
climate and air pollution mitigations) results in a likely warming in 2100 due to the SLCFs of 0.2°C–0.5°C, 
with the largest warming from reductions in aerosols. {6.7.3} 

## Potential Effects of SLCF Mitigation 

*Over time scales of 10 to 20 years, the global temperature response to a year’s worth of current 
emissions of SLCFs is at least as large as that due to a year’s worth of CO₂ emissions (high confidence). 
Sectors producing the largest SLCF-induced warming are those dominated by CH₄ emissions: fossil 
fuel production and distribution, agriculture and waste management (high confidence).* On these time 
scales, SLCFs with cooling effects can significantly mask the CO₂ warming in the case of fossil fuel 
combustion for energy and land transportation, or completely offset the CO₂ warming and lead to an overall 
net cooling in the case of industry and maritime shipping (prior to the implementation of the revised fuel-
sulphur limit policy for shipping in 2020) (medium confidence). Ten years after a one-year pulse of present-
day aviation emissions, SLCFs induce strong, but short-lived warming contributions to the GSAT response 
(medium confidence), while CO₂ both gives a warming effect in the near term and dominates the long-term 
warming impact (high-confidence). {6.6.1, 6.6.2} 
 
*The effects of the SLCFs decay rapidly over the first few decades after pulse emission. Consequently, 
on time scales longer than about 30 years, the net long-term global temperature effects of sectors and 
regions are dominated by CO₂ (high confidence).* The global mean temperature response following a 
climate mitigation measure that affects emissions of both short- and long-lived climate forcers depends on 
their atmospheric decay times, how fast and for how long the emissions are reduced, and the inertia in the 
climate system. For the SLCFs including methane, the rate of emissions drives the long-term global 
temperature effect, as opposed to CO₂ for which the long-term global temperature effect is controlled by the 
cumulative emissions. About 30 years or more after a one-year emission pulse occurs, the sectors 
contributing the most to global warming are industry, fossil fuel combustion for energy and land 
transportation, essentially through CO₂ (high confidence). Current emissions of SLCFs, CO₂ and N2O from 
East Asia and North America are the largest regional contributors to additional net future warming on both 
short- (medium confidence) and long-time scales (high confidence). {6.6.1, 6.6.2} 
 
*At present, emissions from the residential and commercial sectors (fossil and biofuel use for cooking 
and heating) and the energy sector (fossil fuel production, distribution and combustion) contribute the 
most to the world population’s exposure to anthropogenic fine PM (high confidence), whereas 
emissions from the energy and land transportation sectors contribute the most to ozone exposure 
(medium to high confidence).* The contribution of different emission sectors to PM varies across regions, 
with the residential sector being the most important in South Asia and Africa, agricultural emissions 
dominating in Europe and North America, and industry and energy production dominating in Central and 
East Asia, Latin America and Middle East. Energy and industry are important PM2.5 contributors in most 
regions, except Africa (high confidence). Source contributions to surface ozone concentrations are similar for 
all regions. {6.6.2} 
 
*Assuming implementation and efficient enforcement of both the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal 
Protocol on Ozone Depleting Substances and current national plans limit emissions (as in SSP1-2.6), 
the effects of HFCs on GSAT, relative to 2019, would remain below +0. 02°C from 2050 onwards 
versus about +0.04–0.08°C in 2050 and +0.1–0.3°C in 2100 considering only national HFC regulations 
decided prior to the Kigali Amendment (as in SSP5-8.5) (medium confidence).* Further improvements in 
the efficiency of refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment during the transition to low-global-warming-
potential refrigerants would bring additional GHG reductions (medium confidence) resulting in benefits for 
climate change mitigation and to a lesser extent for air quality due to reduced air pollutant emissions from 
power plants. {6.6.3, 6.7.3}  
 
*Future changes in SLCFs are expected to cause an additional warming. This warming is stable after 
2040 in scenarios leading to lower global air pollution as long as methane emissions are also mitigated, 
but the overall warming induced by SLCF changes is higher in scenarios in which air quality 
continues to deteriorate (induced by growing fossil fuel use and limited air pollution control) (high 
confidence).* If a strong air pollution control resulting in reductions in anthropogenic aerosols and non-
methane ozone precursors was considered in SSP3-7.0, it would lead to a likely additional near-term global 
warming of 0.08 [0.00–0.10] °C in 2040. An additional concomitant methane mitigation (consistent with 
SSP1’s stringent climate mitigation policy implemented in the SSP3 world) would not only alleviate this 
warming but would turn this into a cooling of 0.07 with a likely range of [-0.02 to 0.14] °C (compared with 
SSP3-7.0 in 2040). Across the SSPs, the collective reduction of CH₄, ozone precursors and HFCs can make a 
difference of GSAT of 0.2 with a very likely range of [0.1–0.4] °C in 2040 and 0.8  with a very likely range 
of [0.5–1.3] °C at the end of the 21st century (comparing SSP3-7.0 and SSP1-1.9), which is substantial in the 
context of the Paris Agreement. Sustained methane mitigation, wherever it occurs, stands out as an option 
that combines near- and long-term gains on surface temperature (high confidence) and leads to air quality 
benefits by reducing surface ozone levels globally (high confidence). {6.6.3, 6.7.3, 4.4.4}   
 
*Rapid decarbonization strategies lead to air quality improvements but are not sufficient to achieve, in 
the near term, air quality guidelines set for fine PM by the World Health Organization (WHO), 
especially in parts of Asia and in some other highly polluted regions (high confidence).* Additional CH₄ 
and BC mitigation would contribute to offsetting the additional warming associated with SO₂ reductions that 
would accompany decarbonization (high confidence). Strong air pollution control as well as strong climate 
change mitigation, implemented separately, lead to large reductions in exposure to air pollution by the end of 
the century (high confidence). Implementation of air pollution controls, relying on the deployment of 
existing technologies, leads more rapidly to air quality benefits than climate change mitigation, which 
requires systemic changes. However, in both cases, significant parts of the population are projected to remain 
exposed to air pollution exceeding the WHO guidelines. Additional policies envisaged to attain Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDG) (e.g., access to clean energy, waste management) bring complementary SLCF 
reduction. Only strategies integrating climate, air quality, and developments goals are found to effectively 
achieve multiple benefits. {6.6.3, 6.7.3, Box 6.2} 
  
## Implications of COVID-19 Restrictions for Emissions, Air Quality and Climate  
 
*Emissions reductions associated with COVID-19 containment led to a discernible temporary 
improvement of air quality in most regions, but changes to global and regional climate are 
undetectable above internal variability.* Global anthropogenic NOx emissions decreased by a maximum of 
about by 35% in April 2020 (medium confidence). There is high confidence that, with the exception of 
surface ozone, these emission reductions have contributed to improved air quality in most regions of the 
world. Global fossil CO₂ emissions decreased by 7% (with a range of 5.8% to 13.0%) in 2020 relative to 
2019, largely due to reduced emissions from the transportation sector (medium confidence). Overall, the net 
ERF, relative to ongoing trends, from COVID-19 restrictions was likely small and positive for 2020 (less 
than 0.2 W m-2), thus temporarily adding to the total anthropogenic climate influence, with positive forcing 
from aerosol changes dominating over negative forcings from CO₂, NOx and contrail cirrus changes. 
Consistent with this small net radiative forcing, and against a large component of internal variability, Earth 
system model simulations show no detectable effect on global or regional surface temperature or 
precipitation (high confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 6.1} 

# 6.1 Introduction  

Short lived climate forcers (SLCFs) are a set of chemically and physically reactive compounds with 
atmospheric lifetimes typically shorter than two decades but differing in terms of physiochemical properties 
and environmental effects. SLCFs can be classified as direct or indirect, with direct SLCFs exerting climate 
effects through their radiative forcing and indirect SLCFs being precursors of direct climate forcers. Direct 
SLCFs include methane (CH₄), ozone (O3), short lived halogenated compounds, such as hydrofluorocarbons 
(HFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and aerosols. Indirect SLCFs include nitrogen oxides (NOx), 
carbon monoxide (CO), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), sulphur dioxide (SO₂), and 
ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>). Aerosols consist of sulphate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>), nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>),
carbonaceous aerosols (e.g., black carbon (BC), organic aerosols (OA)), mineral dust, and sea spray (see Table 6.1) and 
can be present as internal or external mixtures and at sizes from nano-meters to tens of micro-meters. SLCFs 
can be emitted directly from natural systems and anthropogenic sources (primary) or can be formed by 
reactions in the atmosphere (secondary) (Figure 6.1).  
 
## 6.1.1 Importance of SLCFs for climate and air quality 
 
The atmospheric lifetime determines the spatial and temporal variability, with most SLCFs showing high 
variability, except CH₄ and many HCFCs and HFCs that are also well mixed (as a consequence CH₄ is 
discussed together with other well-mixed GHGs in Chapters 2, 5, and 7). In contrast to well-mixed 
greenhouse gases, such as CO₂, CH₄ and some HFCs, the radiative forcing effects of most of the SLCFs are 
largest at regional scales and climate effects predominantly occur in the first two decades after their 
emissions or formation. However, changes in their emissions can also induce long-term climate effects, for 
instance by altering some biogeochemical cycles. Therefore, the temporal evolution of radiative effects of 
SLCFs follows that of emissions, i.e., when SLCF emissions decline to zero their atmospheric abundance 
and radiative effects decline towards zero. The total influence of individual SLCF emissions on radiative 
forcing and climate account for their effects on the abundances of other forcers through chemistry (chemical 
adjustments). 
 
SLCFs can affect climate by interacting with radiation or by perturbing other components of the climate 
system (e.g., the cryosphere and carbon cycle through deposition, or the water cycle through modifications 
of cloud properties via cloud condensation nuclei or ice nuclei). SLCFs can have either net warming or 
cooling effects on climate. In addition to altering the Earth’s radiative balance, many SLCFs are also air 
pollutants with adverse effects on human health and ecosystems. SLCFs are of interest for climate policies 
(e.g., CH₄, HFCs), and are regulated as air pollutants (e.g., aerosols, O3) or because of their deleterious 
influence on stratospheric ozone (e.g., HCFCs). The list of SLCFs assessed in this chapter and their effects 
are provided in Table 6.1.  
 
<figref>6.1</figref> 
 
<tableref>6.1</tableref> 
 
As depicted in Figure 6.1, emissions of SLCFs are governed by anthropogenic activities and sources from 
natural systems (see Section 6.2 for details). Atmospheric chemistry in this context is both a source and a 
sink of SLCFs. For instance, O3 and secondary aerosols are exclusively formed through atmospheric 
mechanisms (Section 6.3.2 and 6.3.5 respectively). The hydroxyl (OH) radical, the most important oxidizing 
agent in the troposphere, acts as a sink for SLCFs by reacting with them, and thereby, influencing their 
lifetime (Section 6.3.6). Through SLCF radiative forcing and feedbacks (see Section 6.4), key climate 
parameters, such as temperature, hydrological cycle, and weather patterns are perturbed. Climate change also 
influences air quality (Section 6.5). As depicted in Figure 6.1, SLCFs affect both climate and air quality, 
hence SLCF mitigation has linkages to both the issues (Section 6.6). Socio-economic narratives including air 
quality policies determine future projections of SLCFs in the five core Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs): 
SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 (described in Chapter 1), and in addition, a subset of 
SSP3 scenarios allows to isolate the effect of various SLCF mitigation trajectories on climate and air quality 
(Section 6.7). 
 
## 6.1.2  Treatment of SLCFs in previous assessments 
 
Although O3, aerosols and their precursors have been considered in previous IPCC assessment reports, AR5 
considered SLCFs as a specific category of climate relevant compounds but referred to them as near-term 
climate forcers (NTCFs) (Myhre et al., 2013). In AR5, the linkages between air quality and climate change 
were also considered in a more detailed and quantitative way than in previous reports (Kirtman et al., 2013; 
Myhre et al., 2013). 
 
AR5 WGI assessed radiative forcings for short-lived gases, aerosols, aerosol precursors and aerosol cloud 
interactions (ERFaci) as well as the evolution of confidence level in the forcing mechanisms from SAR to 
AR5. Whereas the forcing mechanisms for ozone and aerosol-radiation interactions were estimated to be 
characterised with high confidence, the ones induced by aerosols through other processes remained of very 
low to low confidence. AR5 also reported that forcing agents such as aerosols and ozone changes are highly 
heterogeneous spatially and temporally and these patterns affect global and regional temperature responses 
as well as other aspects of climate response such as the hydrologic cycle (Myhre et al., 2013). 
 
AR5 WGI also evaluated the air quality-climate interaction through the projected trends of surface O3 and 
PM2.5. Kirtman et al. (2013) concluded with high confidence that the response of air quality to climate-driven 
changes is more uncertain than the response to emission-driven changes, and also that locally higher surface 
temperatures in polluted regions will trigger regional feedbacks in chemistry and local emissions that will 
increase peak levels of O3 and PM2.5 (medium confidence). 
 
In the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C (SR15)(Allen et al., 2018a), Rogelj et al., (2018a) state 
that the evolution of CH₄ and SO₂ emissions strongly influences the chances of limiting warming to 1.5°C, 
and that, considering mitigation scenarios to limit warming to 1.5 or 2°C, a weakening of aerosol cooling 
would add to future warming in the near term, but can be tempered by reductions in methane emissions (high 
confidence). In addition, as some SLCFs are co-emitted alongside CO₂, especially in the energy and transport 
sectors, low CO₂ scenarios, relying on decline of fossil fuel use, can result in strong abatement of some 
cooling and warming SLCFs (Rogelj et al., 2018a). 
 
On the other hand, specific reductions of the warming SLCFs (CH₄ and BC) would, in the short term, 
contribute significantly to the efforts of limiting warming to 1.5°C. Reductions of BC and CH₄ would have 
substantial co-benefits improving air quality and therefore limit effects on human health and agricultural 
yields. This would, in turn, enhance the institutional and socio-cultural feasibility of such actions in line with 
the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (Coninck et al., 2018). 
 
Following SR15, the IPCC Special Report Climate Change and Land (SRCCL)(IPCC, 2019a) took into 
consideration the emissions on land of three major SLCFs: mineral dust, carbonaceous aerosols (BC and 
OA) and BVOCs (Jia et al., 2019). The SRCCL concluded that: i) there is no agreement about the direction 
of future changes in mineral dust emissions; ii) fossil fuel and biomass burning, and SOA from natural 
BVOC emissions are the main global sources of carbonaceous aerosols whose emissions are expected to 
increase in the near future due to possible increases in open biomass burning and increase in SOA from 
oxidation of BVOCs (medium confidence); iii) BVOCs are emitted in large amounts by forests and they are 
rapidly oxidised in the atmosphere to form less volatile compounds that can condense and form SOA, and in 
a warming planet, BVOC emissions are expected to increase but magnitude is unknown and will depend on 
future land use change, in addition to climate (limited evidence, medium agreement). 
 
Finally, the IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC)(IPCC, 
2019b) discussed the effects of BC deposition on snow and glaciers, concluding that there is high confidence 
that darkening of snow through the deposition of BC and other light absorbing particles enhances snow melt 
in the Arctic (Meredith et al., 2019), but that there is limited evidence and low agreement that long-term 
changes in glacier mass of high mountain areas are linked to light absorbing particles (Hock et al., 2019). 
 
 
## 6.1.3  Chapter Roadmap 
 
Figure 6.2 presents the Chapter 6 roadmap.  
 
Specific aspects of SLCFs can also be found in other chapters of this report: the evolution of ozone, HFCs, 
aerosols as well as long term evolution of methane, dust, volcanic aerosols are discussed in Chapter 2, near-
term climate projections and SLCFs are discussed in Chapter 4, the global budget of methane is addressed in 
Chapter 5, aerosol-cloud and aerosol-precipitation interactions are treated in Chapters 7 and 8, respectively, 
the global radiative forcing of SLCFs is assessed in Chapter 7, some aspects of downscaling methodology in 
climate modelling concerning SLCFs are discussed in Chapter 10. The WGII report assesses how climate 
change affects air pollution and impacts on human health and the WGIII report assesses the role of SLCFs in 
abatement strategies and their cost effectiveness, the implications of mitigation efforts on air pollution as 
well as the articulation between air pollution policies and GHG mitigation.  
 
This chapter discusses air quality from a global point of view with focus on surface ozone and particulate 
matter surface concentrations. Local and indoor air pollution, as well as effect of air pollution on health, are 
beyond the scope of this chapter. This assessment is mainly based on results and studies relying on global 
models or observation datasets operated through global networks or from satellites. Global chemistry-climate 
models allow to quantify the changes in background concentrations such as surface ozone due to large scale 
changes in climate or CH₄ by considering comprehensively the physiochemical processes (see Box 6.1). In 
addition, climate effects are often non-linear responses to concentrations which already respond non-linearly 
to emissions, with per mass unit effects often larger in pristine than in polluted regions, justifying the 
relevance of global models. However, specific aspects of urban air quality cannot be captured by global 
models and require high resolution modelling which reproduce the temporal and spatial variability of 
emissions and abundances necessary to precisely account for the non-linearity of the chemistry and the 
sensitivity of local air pollution to its drivers. Consequently, the sectoral analysis in Section 6.6 and the 
mitigation effects in Section 6.7 cannot be directly applied for local air quality planning.  
 
Due to their short lifetimes, SLCF trends and effects are strongly related to the localisation and evolution of 
the emission sources. To better link the drivers of emission evolution and SLCFs, Chapter 6 makes use of 
regions defined by the WGIII in most of the analysis. An exception is made for the effect of SLCFs on the 
climate, for which analysis relies on WGI Atlas regions.

# 6.2  Global and regional temporal evolution of SLCF emissions 
 
SLCF emissions originate from a variety of sources driven by anthropogenic activities and natural processes. 
The natural sources include vegetation, soil, fire, lightning, volcanoes, and oceans. Changes in SLCF 
emissions from natural systems occur either due to human activities, such as land-use change, or due to 
global changes. Their sensitivity to climate change thus induces a climate feedback (see Section 6.4.6 for a 
quantification of these feedbacks). This section reviews the current understanding of historical emissions for 
anthropogenic, natural, and open biomass burning sources. A detailed discussion of methane sources, sinks, 
trends and their evaluation are provided in Chapter 5; Section 5.2.2.  
 
 
## 6.2.1  Anthropogenic sources 
 
Estimates of global anthropogenic SLCF emissions and their historical evolution that were used in AR5 
(CMIP5) (Lamarque et al., 2010) have been revised for use in CMIP6 (Hoesly et al., 2018). The update 
considered new data and assessment of the impact of the environmental policies, primarily regarding air 
pollution control (Wang et al., 2014c, 2014b; Montzka et al., 2015; Crippa et al., 2016; Turnock et al., 2016; 
Klimont et al., 2017a; Zanatta et al., 2017; Prinn et al., 2018). Additionally, Hoesly et al. (2018) have 
extended estimates of anthropogenic emissions back to 1750 and developed an updated and new set of 
spatial proxies allowing for more differentiated (source sector-wise) gridding of emissions (Feng et al., 
2020). The CMIP6 emission inventory has been developed with the Community Emissions Data System 
(CEDS) that improves upon existing inventories with a more consistent and reproducible methodology, 
similar to approaches used in, for example, EDGAR (Crippa et al., 2016) and GAINS model (Amann et al., 
2011; Klimont et al., 2017b; Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2020) where emissions of all compounds are 
consistently estimated using the same emission drivers and propagating individual components (activity data 
and emission factors) separately to capture fuel and technology trends affecting emission trajectories over 
time. This contrasts the approach used to establish historical emissions for CMIP5 where different data sets 
available at the time were combined. The CMIP6 exercise is based on the first release of CEDS emission 
dataset (version 2017-05-18, sometimes referred to hereafter as CMIP6 emissions) whose main features 
regarding SLCFs are described hereafter. The CEDS has been and will be regularly updated and extended; 
the recent update of CEDS (Hoesly et al., 2019) and consequences for this assessment is discussed when 
necessary. Some details on how SLCF emissions have been represented in scenarios used by IPCC 
assessments can be found in Chapter 1 (see Chapter 1, Section 1.6.1 and Cross Chapter Box 1.4). 
 
For most of the SLCF species, the global and regional anthropogenic emission trends developed for CMIP6 
for the period 1850 to 2000 are not substantially different from those used in CMIP5 (Figures 6.18 & 6.19) 
despite the different method used to derive them. Hoesly et al. (2018, CEDS) developed an independent time 
series capturing trends in fuel use, technology, and level of control, whereas CMIP5 combined different 
emission data sets. However, for the period after 1990, the CMIP6 dataset shows for all species, except for 
SO₂ and CO and since 2011 for NOx, a different trend than CMIP5, i.e., continued strong growth of 
emissions driven primarily by developments in Asia (Figure 6.19). The unprecedented growth of East and 
South Asian emissions since 2000 changed the global landscape of emissions making Asia the dominant 
SLCF source region (Figures 6.3, 6.19). The Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios used 
in AR5 started from the year 2000 (van Vuuren et al., 2011) and did not represent well the development of 
SLCF emissions until 2015. The CEDS inventory (Hoesly et al., 2018) includes improved representation of 
these trends and the estimate for 2014. These findings have been largely supported by several independent 
emission inventory studies and remote sensing data analysis, however, for the last decade the decline of 
Asian emissions of SO₂ and NOx appears underestimated while growth of BC and OC emissions in Asia and 
Africa seems overestimated in CMIP6, compared to most recent regional evaluations (Klimont et al., 2017b; 
Zheng et al., 2018b; e.g., Elguindi et al., 2020; Kanaya et al., 2020; McDuffie et al., 2020), which are largely 
considered in the updated release of the CEDS (Hoesly et al., 2019). Consequently, global CMIP6 
anthropogenic emissions for 2015 are likely overestimated by about 10% for SO₂ and NOx and about 15% 
for BC and OC.  
 
For SO₂, independent emission inventories and observational evidence show that on a global scale strong 
growth of Asian emissions has been countered by reduction in North America and Europe (Reis et al., 2012; 
Amann et al., 2013; Crippa et al., 2016; Aas et al., 2019). Since about 2006, also Chinese emissions declined 
by nearly 70% by 2017 (Silver et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2018b; Mortier et al., 2020; Tong et al., 2020) (high 
confidence). The estimated reduction in China contrasts continuing strong growth of SO₂ emissions in South 
Asia (Figure 6.19). In 2014, over 80% of anthropogenic SO₂ emissions originated from power plants and 
industry with Asian sources contributing more than 50% of total (Figure 6.3). 
 
Global emissions of NOx have been growing in spite of the successful reduction of emissions in North 
America, Europe, Japan, Korea (Crippa et al., 2016; Turnock et al., 2016; Miyazaki et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 
2018a) partly driven by continuous efforts to strengthen the emission standards for road vehicles in most 
countries (Figure 6.18 & 6.19). In many regions, an increase in vehicle fleet as well as non-compliance with 
emission standards (Anenberg et al., 2017, 2019; Jonson et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2018a), growing aviation 
(Grewe et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2021) and demand for energy, and consequently large number of new fossil 
fuel power plants, have been overcompensating these reductions. Since about 2011, global NOx emissions 
appear to have stabilized or slightly declined (medium confidence) but the global rate of decline has been 
underestimated in CEDS, as recent data suggest that emission reductions in China were larger than included 
in CEDs. (Figure 6.19 and Hoesly et al. (2018)). Recent bottom up emission estimates (Zheng et al., 2018b) 
largely confirm what has been shown in satellite data (Liu et al., 2016a; Miyazaki et al., 2017; Silver et al., 
2018); a strong decline of NO2 column over Eastern China (high confidence) (see Section 6.3.3.1). At a 
global level, the estimated CEDS CO emission trends are comparable to NOx, which has been confirmed by 
several inverse modelling studies (see Section 6.3.3.2). Transport sector (including international shipping 
and aviation) was the largest anthropogenic source of NOx (about 50% of total) and contributed also over 
25% of CO emissions in 2014, and Asia represented half and North America and Europe about 20% of 
global total NOx and CO (Figure 6.3). 
 
Oil production-distribution and transport sector have dominated anthropogenic NMVOC emissions for most 
of the 20th century (Hoesly et al., 2018) and still represent a large share (Figure 6.3). Efforts to control 
transport emissions (i.e. increasing stringency of vehicle emission limits) were largely offset by fast growth 
of emissions from chemical industries and solvent use as well as from fossil fuel production and distribution, 
resulting in continued growth of global anthropogenic NMVOC emissions since 1900 (Figure 6.18) (high 
confidence). Since AR5, there is high confidence that motor vehicle NMVOC emissions have sharply 
decreased in North America and Europe in the last decades (Rossabi and Helmig, 2018), i.e., by about an 
order of magnitude in major U.S. cities since 1990 (Bishop and Haugen, 2018; McDonald et al., 2018). 
Increasing (since 2008) oil and gas extraction activities in North America lead to a strong growth of 
NMVOC emissions (high confidence) as shown by analysis of ethane columns data (Franco et al., 2016), but 
absolute emission amounts remain uncertain (Pétron et al., 2014; Tzompa-Sosa et al., 2019). In East Asia, 
there is medium confidence in a decreasing trend of motor vehicle emissions, suggested by ambient 
measurements in Beijing since 2002 (Wang et al., 2015) and by bottom-up estimates (Zheng et al., 2018b), 
and decrease of residential heating emissions due to declining coal and biofuel use since 2005 (Zheng et al., 
2018b; Li et al., 2019b). However, total anthropogenic NMVOC emissions have increased steadily in China 
since the mid-20th century, largely due to growing importance of the solvent use and industrial sectors (Sun 
et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2018b; Li et al., 2019b) (medium evidence, high agreement). Resulting changes in 
the NMVOC speciated emissions might be underestimated in the current regional and global inventories. For 
example, in the U.S., a recent study suggested an emergent shift in urban NMVOC sources from 
transportation to chemical products (i.e. household chemicals, personal care products, solvents, etc.), which 
is not in accordance with emission inventories currently used (McDonald et al., 2018). In many European 
regions and cities, wood burning has been increasingly used for residential heating, partly for economic 
reasons and because it is considered CO₂-neutral (Athanasopoulou et al., 2017); in situ measurements in 
several cities, including Paris, suggest that wood burning explains up to half the NMVOC emissions during 
winter (Kaltsonoudis et al., 2016; Languille et al., 2020). Due to the vast heterogeneity of sources and 
components of VOCs, uncertainty in regional emissions and trends is higher than for most other components. 
 
Emissions of carbonaceous aerosols (BC, OC) have been steadily increasing and their emissions have almost 
doubled since 1950 (Hoesly et al., 2018) (medium confidence). Before 1950, North America and Europe 
contributed about half of the global total but successful introduction of diesel particulate filters on road 
vehicles (Fiebig et al., 2014; Robinson et al., 2015; Klimont et al., 2017a) and declining reliance on solid 
fuels for heating brought in large reductions (Figure 6.19) (high confidence). Currently, global carbonaceous 
aerosol emissions originate primarily from Asia and Africa (Bond et al., 2013; Hoesly et al., 2018; Elguindi 
et al., 2020; McDuffie et al., 2020), representing about 80% of global total (Figure 6.3) (high confidence). 
Consideration, in CMIP6, of emissions from kerosene lamps and gas flaring, revised estimates for open 
burning of waste, regional coal consumption, and new estimates for Russia (Stohl et al., 2013; Huang et al., 
2015; Huang and Fu, 2016; Kholod et al., 2016; Conrad and Johnson, 2017; Evans et al., 2017; Klimont et 
al., 2017a) resulted in over 15% higher global emissions of OC and BC than in the CMIP5 estimates for the 
first decade of the 21st Century (Figure 6.18). The continued increase of BC emissions over East Asia after 
2005, estimated in CMIP6 (Figure 6.19), has been, however, questioned recently as a steady decline of BC 
concentrations was measured in the air masses flowing out from east coast of China (Kanaya et al., 2020), 
which has been also estimated in recent regional bottom-up and top-down inventories (Zheng et al., 2018a; 
Elguindi et al., 2020; McDuffie et al., 2020). Since AR5, confidence in emission estimates and trends in 
North America and Europe has increased but high uncertainties remain for Asia and Africa that dominate 
global emissions. Size distribution of emitted species, of importance for climate and health impacts, remains 
uncertain and CEDS inventory does not provide such information. Overall, a factor two uncertainty in global 
estimates of BC and OC emissions remains, with post 2005 emissions overestimated in Asia (high 
confidence) and Africa (medium confidence).  
 
Bottom up global emission estimates of CH₄  (Lamarque et al., 2010; Hoesly et al., 2018; Janssens-Maenhout 
et al., 2019; Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2020) for the last two decades are higher than top down assessments 
(e.g., Saunois et al., 2016, 2020) but trends from the two methods are similar and indicate continued growth 
(high confidence). Larger discrepancies exist at the sectoral and regional levels, notably for coal mining 
(Peng et al., 2016; Miller et al., 2019) and oil and gas sector due to growth of unconventional production and 
higher loss estimates (Franco et al., 2016; Alvarez et al., 2018; Dalsøren et al., 2018) (see also Section 5.2.2).  
 
Agricultural production (livestock and mineral nitrogen fertilizer application) is the primarily source of 
ammonia in the atmosphere with more than half of present day emissions originating in Asia (Hoesly et al., 
2018; Figure 6.3, EC-JRC / PBL, 2020; Vira et al., 2020). NH<sub>3</sub> emissions are estimated to have grown 
strongly since 1850, especially since 1950 driven by continuously increasing livestock production, 
widespread application of mineral nitrogen fertilizers and lack of action to control ammonia (Erisman et al., 
2008; Riddick et al., 2016; Hoesly et al., 2018; Fowler et al., 2020) (high confidence). The trends estimated 
in CMIP5 and CMIP6 are similar, while in absolute terms CMIP6 has somewhat higher emissions as it 
includes emissions from wastewater and human waste that were largely missing in CMIP5 (Hoesly et al., 
2018). CMIP6 has improved spatial and temporal distribution of emissions (e.g., Lamarque et al., 2013a) 
relying on the EDGAR v4.3 and Paulot et al. (2014), but important uncertainties remain for regionally-
specific temporal patterns (Riddick et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2019; Feng et al., 2020; Vira et al., 2020). The 
continuing increase in global NH<sub>3</sub> emissions is driven primarily by growing livestock and crop production in 
Asia while emissions in the US and Europe remain about constant or slightly decline in the last decade  
(Hoesly et al., 2018). Recent satellite and ground observations support trends estimated in CMIP6 dataset 
(Section 6.3.3.4).  
 
To summarize, there are significant differences in spatial and temporal emission patterns of SLCFs across 
global regions (Figure 6.18). Until the 1950s, the majority of SLCF emissions associated with fossil fuel use 
(SO₂, NOx, NMVOCs, CO) and about half of BC and OC originated from North America and Europe 
(Lamarque et al., 2010; Hoesly et al., 2018). Since the 1990s a large redistribution of emission was 
associated with strong economic growth in Asia and declining emissions in North America and Europe due 
to air quality legislation and declining capacity of energy intensive industry, and currently more than 50% of 
anthropogenic emissions of each SLCF species (including CH₄ and NH<sub>3</sub>) originates from Asia (Amann et al., 
2013; Bond et al., 2013; Fiore et al., 2015; Crippa et al., 2016, 2018; Klimont et al., 2017a; Hoesly et al., 
2018) (Figure 6.3). The dominance of Asia for SLCF emissions is corroborated by growing remote sensing 
capacity that has been providing independent evaluation of estimated pollution trends in the last decade 
(Duncan et al., 2013; Lamsal et al., 2015; Luo et al., 2015; Fioletov et al., 2016; Geddes et al., 2016; Irie et 
al., 2016; Krotkov et al., 2016; Wen et al., 2018). 
 
Since AR5, the quality and completeness of activity and emission factor data and applied methodology, 
including spatial allocation together with independent satellite-derived observations, have improved, raising 
confidence in methods used to derive emissions. There is high confidence in the sign of global trends of 
SLCF emissions until the year 2000. However, only medium confidence for the rate of change in the two last 
decades owing primarily to uncertainties in actual application of reduction technologies in fast growing 
economies of Asia.  At a regional level, bottom-up derived SLCF emission trends and magnitudes in regions 
with strong economic growth and changing air quality regulation are highly uncertain and better constrained 
with top-down methods (Section 6.3). For most SLCF species, there is high confidence in trends and 
magnitudes for affluent OECD regions where accurate and detailed information about drivers of emissions 
exists; medium confidence is assessed for regional emissions of NH<sub>3</sub>, CH₄ and NMVOC.

## 6.2.2  Emissions by natural systems 
 
This section assesses our current understanding of SLCF emissions by natural systems. Many naturally 
occurring emission processes in the Earth System have been perturbed by the growing influence of human 
activities either directly (e.g., deforestation, agriculture) or via human-induced atmospheric CO₂ increase and 
climate change and can therefore not be considered as purely natural emissions. The temporal evolution and 
spatial distribution of natural SLCF emissions are highly variable and their estimates rely on models with 
rather uncertain parameterizations for production mechanisms. For some SLCFs, the natural processes by 
which emissions occur are also not well-understood. In the following sections, we assess the level of 
confidence in present-day SLCF emissions by natural systems, in their perturbation since preindustrial and 
their sensitivity to future changes. When available, the assessment also includes estimates from CMIP6 
model ensemble. Note that volcanic SO₂ emissions are discussed in Section 2.2.2.  
 
 
### 6.2.2.1  Lightning NOx 
 
Lightning contributes ~10% of the total NOx emissions (Murray, 2016). Since lightning NOx (LNOx) is 
predominantly released in the upper troposphere, it has a disproportionately large impact on O3 and OH, and 
on the lifetime of CH₄ compared with surface NOx emissions. Whereas the global spatial and temporal 
distribution of lightning flashes can be characterized thanks to satellite-borne and ground sensors 
(DuplicateVirts, 2013; Cecil et al., 2014), constraining the amount of NOx produced per flash  (Miyazaki et 
al., 2014; Medici et al., 2017; Nault et al., 2017; Marais et al., 2018; Allen et al., 2019a; Bucsela et al., 2019) 
and its vertical allocation (Koshak et al., 2014; Medici et al., 2017) has been more elusive. Atmospheric 
Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project (ACCMIP) models in CMIP5 used a range of LNOx 
between 1.2 to 9.7 TgN year-1 (Lamarque et al., 2013c). In CMIP6, the corresponding LNOx range is 
between 3.2 to 7.6 TgN year-1 (Griffiths et al., 2020). All CMIP6 models (as well as most models included in 
the CMIP5, Young et al., 2013) apply a parameterization that relates cloud-top-height to lightning intensity 
(Price and Rind, 1992), projecting an increase in LNOx in a warmer world in the range 0.27 to 0.61 Tg(N) 
yr−1 per °C (Thornhill et al., 2021a). However, models using parameterizations based on convection (Grewe 
et al., 2001), updraft mass flux (Allen and Pickering, 2002), or ice flux (Finney et al., 2016a) show either 
much less sensitivity or a negative response (Finney et al., 2016b, 2018; Clark et al., 2017).  
In summary, the total present-day global lightning NOx emissions are still estimated to be within a factor of 2.
There is high confidence that LNOx are perturbed by climate change however there is low confidence in 
the sign of the change due to fundamental uncertainties in parameterizations.  
 
 
### 6.2.2.2  NOx emissions by soils 
 
Soil NOx (SNOx) emissions occur in connection with complex biogenic/microbial nitrification and 
denitrification processes (Ciais et al., 2013), which in turn are sensitive – in a non-linear manner – to 
temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, carbon and nutrient content and the biome itself (e.g., Hudman et 
al., 2012). Global SNOx estimates, based on observationally constrained chemistry-transport model and 
vegetation model studies, show a broad range between 4.7 and 16.8 TgN/yr (Young et al., 2018). This 
estimate is generally larger than the current source strength used in CMIP6 simulations, which is prescribed 
using an early empirical estimate, typically scaled to about 5 TgN/yr (Yienger and Levy, 1995)  
Under warmer climate, the overall nitrogen fixation in non-agricultural ecosystems is expected to be 40% 
larger than in 2000, due to increased enzyme activity with growing temperatures, but the emission rates of 
NO (and N2O) is expected to be dominated by changes in precipitation patterns and evapotranspiration fluxes 
(Fowler et al., 2015). Current earth system models (ESM) incorporate biophysical and biogeochemical 
processes only to a limited extent (Jia et al., 2019), precluding adequate climate sensitivity studies for SNOx. 
Hence, while the current strength source of soil NOx has been better constrained over the last decade, 
adequate representations of SNOx and how it escapes from the canopy are still missing in ESM to provide 
quantitative estimates of climate driven changes in SNOx. 
 
### 6.2.2.3  Vegetation emissions of organic compounds  
 
A wide range of BVOCs are emitted from vegetation with the dominant compounds being isoprene and 
monoterpenes but also including sesquiterpenes, alkenes, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones. The photo-
oxidation of BVOC emissions plays a fundamental role in atmospheric composition by controlling the 
regional and global budgets of ozone and organic aerosols, and impacting the lifetime of methane and other 
reactive components (Arneth et al., 2010b; Heald and Spracklen, 2015). Substantial uncertainty exists across 
different modelling frameworks for estimates of global total BVOC emissions and individual compound 
emissions (Messina et al., 2016). Global isoprene emission estimates differ by a factor of 2 from 300-600 
Tg(C) yr-1 and global monoterpene emission estimates by a factor of 5 from 30-150 Tg(C) yr-1 (Messina et 
al., 2016). A main driver of the uncertainty ranges is the choice of assignment of PFT-specific basal emission 
rates in the model, however, the smaller uncertainty range for isoprene than for monoterpenes is not fully 
understood (Arneth et al., 2008). The evaluation of global BVOC emissions is challenging because of poor 
measurement data coverage in many regions and the lack of year-round measurements (Unger et al., 2013). 
Several observational approaches have been developed in the past few years to improve understanding of 
BVOC emissions including indirect methods such as the measurement of the OH loss rate in forested 
environments (Yang et al., 2016) and application of the variability in satellite formaldehyde concentrations 
(Palmer et al., 2006; Barkley et al., 2013; Stavrakou et al., 2014). Direct space-borne isoprene retrievals 
using infrared (IR) radiance measurements have very recently become available (Fu et al., 2019; Wells et al., 
2020). Collectively these approaches have identified weaknesses in the ability of the parameterizations in 
global models to reproduce BVOC emissions hotspots (Wells et al., 2020). However, none of the current 
observational approaches have yet been able to reduce the uncertainty ranges in global emission estimates. 
 
At the plant level, BVOC emission rates and composition depend strongly on plant species with plants 
tending to emit either isoprene or monoterpenes but not both. Photosynthetic activity is a main driver of 
isoprene and monoterpene production. Therefore, radiation and temperature, along with leaf water status, 
phenological state and atmospheric CO₂ mixing ratio, affect emissions directly (on the leaf-scale) and 
indirectly (via plant productivity) (Guenther et al., 2012; Loreto et al., 2014; Niinemets et al., 2014). CO₂ 
directly influences the isoprene synthesis process, with inhibition under increasing atmospheric CO₂ 
(Rosenstiel et al., 2003; Possell et al., 2005; Wilkinson et al., 2009). Direct CO₂ inhibition has been observed 
for some monoterpene compounds (Loreto et al., 2001; Llorens et al., 2009). Severe/long-term water stress 
may reduce emissions whilst mild/short-term water stress may temporarily amplify or maintain BVOC 
emissions to protect plants against on-going stress (Peñuelas and Staudt, 2010; Potosnak et al., 2014; 
Genard-Zielinski et al., 2018).  Furthermore, observations in the Amazon, indicate the chemical composition 
of monoterpene emissions could also change under elevated temperature conditions (Jardine et al., 2016). In 
addition, all these processes are investigated over short-time scales but the long-term response of BVOC 
emissions depends on how the vegetation itself responds to the altered climate state (including temperature 
and water stress). 
 
Global BVOC emissions are highly sensitive to environmental change including changes in climate, 
atmospheric CO₂ and vegetation composition and cover changes in natural and managed lands. Recent global 
modelling studies agree that global isoprene emissions have declined since the preindustrial driven 
predominantly by anthropogenic LULCC with results converging on a 10-25% loss of isoprene emissions 
globally between 1850 and present day (Lathière et al., 2010; Unger, 2013, 2014; Acosta Navarro et al., 
2014; Heald and Geddes, 2016a; Hantson et al., 2017; Hollaway et al., 2017; Scott et al., 2017). The 
historical evolution of monoterpene and sesquiterpene emissions is less well studied and there is no robust 
consensus on even the sign of the change (Acosta Navarro et al., 2014; Hantson et al., 2017). Future global 
isoprene and monoterpene emissions depend strongly on the climate and land-use scenarios considered 
(Hantson et al., 2017; Szogs et al., 2017). BVOC emissions will be sensitive to future land-based climate 
change mitigation strategies including afforestation and bioenergy, with impacts of bioenergy depending on 
the choice of crops (Szogs et al., 2017).  
 
Most CMIP6 models use overly simplistic parameterizations and project an increase in global BVOC 
emissions in response to warming temperatures (Turnock et al., 2020). This good agreement actually reflects 
the lack of diversity in BVOC emission parametrizations in global models that do not fully account for the 
complex processes influencing emissions discussed above. 
 
Overall, we assess that historical global isoprene emissions declined between the preindustrial and present 
day by 10-25% low confidence) but historical changes in global monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are too 
uncertain to provide an assessment. Future changes in BVOCs depend strongly on the evolution of climate 
and land-use and are strongly sensitive to land-based climate change mitigation strategies. However, the net 
response of BVOC emissions is uncertain due to complexity of processes, hard to constrain observationally, 
considered with various degrees of details in models. 


### 6.2.2.4  Land emissions of dust particles 
 
The emission of dust particles into the atmosphere results from a natural process, namely saltation 
bombardment of the soil by large wind-blown particles such as sand grains and from disintegration of 
saltating particle clusters (Kok et al., 2012). The occurrence and intensity of dust emissions are controlled by 
soil properties, vegetation, and near-surface wind, making dust emissions sensitive to changes in climate, and 
land-use and land cover (Jia et al., 2019). In addition, dust can be directly emitted through human activities, 
such as agriculture, off-road vehicles, building construction, mining, and indirectly emitted through 
hydrological changes due to human actions such water diversion for irrigation (e.g. Ginoux et al., 2012). 
Estimates of the anthropogenic fraction of global dust vary from less than 10% to over 60% suggesting that 
human contribution to the global dust budget is quite uncertain (Ginoux et al., 2012; Stanelle et al., 2014; Xi 
and Sokolik, 2016). Reconstruction of global dust (deposition) from paleo records indicate factor of 2 to 4 
changes between the different climate regimes in the glacial and interglacial periods (see Section 2.2.6). An 
extremely limited number of studies have explored the evolution of global dust sources since preindustrial 
times (Mahowald et al., 2010; Stanelle et al., 2014). A modelling study estimated a 25% increase in global 
dust emissions between the late nineteenth century to present due to agricultural land expansion and climate 
change (Stanelle et al., 2014). CMIP5 models were unable to capture the observed variability of annual and 
longer time scales in North African dust emissions (Evan et al., 2014), however more recent ESMs with 
process-based dust emission schemes that account for changes in vegetation and climate in a more consistent 
manner better match the observations (Kok et al., 2014; Evans et al., 2016). Feedbacks between the global 
dust cycle and the climate system (see Section 6.4.6) could account for a substantial fraction of the total 
aerosol feedbacks in the climate system with an order of magnitude enhancement on regional scale (Kok et 
al., 2018). In summary, there is high confidence that atmospheric dust source and loading are sensitive to 
changes in climate and land use, however, there is low confidence in quantitative estimates of dust emission 
response to climate change.  
 
 
### 6.2.2.5  Oceanic emissions of marine aerosols and precursors 
 
Oceans are a significant source of marine aerosols that influence climate directly by scattering and absorbing 
solar radiation or indirectly through the formation of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nucleating 
particles (INP). Marine aerosols consist of primary sea spray particles and secondary aerosols produced by 
the oxidation of emitted precursors, such as dimethylsulphide (DMS) and numerous other BVOCs. Sea spray 
particles, composed of sea-salt and primary organic aerosols (POA), are produced by wind induced wave 
breaking as well as direct mechanical disruption of waves. The understanding of sea spray emissions has 
increased substantially over the last five years, however, the knowledge of formation pathways and factors 
influencing their emissions continue to have large uncertainties (Forestieri et al., 2018; Saliba et al., 2019). 
The emission rate of sea-spray particles is predominantly controlled by wind speed. Since AR5, the influence 
of other factors, including sea surface temperature, wave history and salinity is increasingly evident 
(Callaghan et al., 2014; Grythe et al., 2014; Ovadnevaite et al., 2014; Salter et al., 2014; Barthel et al., 2019). 
Marine POA, often the dominant submicron component of sea spray, are emitted as a result of oceanic 
biological activity, however the biological processes by which these particles are produced remain poorly 
characterized contributing to large uncertainties in global marine POA emission estimates (Tsigaridis et al., 
2014; Burrows et al., 2018; Cravigan et al., 2020; Hodzic et al., 2020). Furthermore, particle size and 
chemical composition of sea spray particles and how these evolve in response to changing climate factors 
and dynamic oceanic biology continue to have large uncertainties.  
 
DMS, the largest natural source of sulphur in the atmosphere, is produced by marine phytoplankton and is 
transferred from ocean water to the atmosphere due to wind-induced mixing of surface water. DMS oxidizes 
to produce sulphate aerosols and contributes to the formation of CCN. Since AR5, the range in global DMS 
flux estimates reduced from 10-40 Tg S year-1 to 9 to 34 Tg S year-1 with a very likely range of 18-24 Tg S 
year-1 based on sea-surface measurements and satellite observations (Lana et al., 2011). DMS production, 
and consequently emissions, have been shown to respond to multiple stressors, including climate warming, 
eutrophication, and ocean acidification. However, large uncertainties in process-based understanding of the 
mechanisms controlling DMS emissions, from physiological to ecological, limit our knowledge of past 
variations and our capacity to predict future changes. 
 
Overall, there is low confidence in the magnitude and changes in marine aerosol emissions in response to 
shifts in climate and marine ecosystem processes. 
 
 
### 6.2.2.6  Open biomass burning emissions  
 
Open biomass burning (including forest, grassland, peat fires and agricultural waste burning) represent about 
30%, 10%, 15% and 40% of present-day global emissions of CO, NOx, BC, and OC, respectively (van Marle 
et al., 2017; Hoesly et al., 2018). Wildfires also play an important role in several atmospheric chemistry–
climate feedback mechanisms (Bowman et al., 2009; Fiore et al., 2012) and fire events occurring near 
populated areas induce severe air pollution episodes (Marlier et al., 2020; Rooney et al., 2020; Yu et al., 
2020). 
 
For the last two decades, model-based emission estimates are constrained by remote sensing capacity to 
detect active fires and area burned. In AR5, biomass burning emissions were derived from a satellite product 
(Lamarque et al., 2010). Since then, improvements in detection of small fires has enhanced the agreement 
with higher-resolution and ground-based data on burned area in several regions (Randerson et al., 2012; 
Mangeon et al., 2015) especially for areas subjected to agricultural waste burning (Chuvieco et al., 2016, 
2019). The updated emission factors and contribution of forest versus savannah fires lead to significantly 
higher global emissions of NOx and lower emissions of OC and CO in CMIP6, compared with CMIP5. A 
recent compilation and assessment of emission factors (Andreae, 2019) indicates that the emission factors 
from Akagi et al. (2011), primarily used to produce the CMIP6 datasets, differ within ±50% for CO, OC, 
BC, and NOx, depending on the biome, and would imply, for example, up to 10-30% higher OC and BC 
emissions from tropical forest fires.  
 
The historical (pre-satellite era) dataset for CMIP6 considers advances in knowledge of past fire dynamics 
(new fire proxy datasets, such as charcoal in sediments or levoglucosan in ice-cores) and visibility records 
from weather stations (Marlon et al., 2016; van Marle et al., 2017). At a global level, CMIP5 and CMIP6 
emission trends are similar, however, there are substantial differences at the regional level, especially for the 
United States, South America (south of Amazonia), and southern hemisphere Africa (van Marle et al., 2017). 
 
Globally, the CMIP5 estimates (Lamarque et al., 2010), indicated gradual decline of open biomass burning 
emission from 1920 to about 1950 and then steady, and stronger than CMIP6, increase towards 2000. In 
contrast, CMIP6 biomass burning emissions (van Marle et al., 2017) increase only slightly over 1750 to 2015 
and peak during the 1990s after which they decrease gradually consistently, with the assessment of fire 
trends in Chapter 5. Therefore, the CMIP6 evolution has a smaller difference between pre-industrial and 
present emissions than CMIP5, resulting in a lower radiative forcing of biomass burning SLCFs, leading to 
possibly lower effect on climate (van Marle et al., 2017).  
 
Climate warming, especially through change in temperature and precipitation, will generally increase the risk 
of fire (Jia et al., 2019, see also Chapter 12) and can also affect the fire injection and plume height (Veira et 
al., 2016), but occurrence of fires and their emissions in the future strongly depends on anthropogenic factors 
such as population density, land use and fire management (Veira et al., 2016). Consequently, future 
emissions vary widely with increases and decreases amongst the SSP scenarios due to different land use 
change scenarios.  
 
In summary, there has been an improvement in the knowledge of biomass burning emissions by reducing 
key uncertainties highlighted in AR5. However, systematic assessment of remaining uncertainties is limited, 
with a lower limit of uncertainties due to emission factors of 30 %, and larger uncertainties due to burning 
activity estimates, especially at regional level. Overall, a medium confidence in current global biomass 
burning SLCF emissions and their evolution over the satellite era is assessed. There is low-to-medium 
confidence in pre-industrial to the 1980s of biomass SLCF emissions, which rely on incorporation of several 
proxy data, with limited spatial representativeness. Nevertheless, uncertainties in absolute value of pre-
industrial emissions remain high, limiting confidence of radiative forcing estimates.  
 
 
# 6.3  Evolution of Atmospheric SLCF abundances 
 
This section assesses the evolution of atmospheric abundance1 of SLCFs since AR5 based on observations 
and modelling, our knowledge of SLCFs burden and distribution, and our understanding of the trends over 
longer time scales. In addition to emissions (section 6.2), atmospheric chemistry (gas and aqueous 
chemistry), deposition (including wet and dry removal), and transport processes play a major role in 
determining the atmospheric distribution, budget and lifetime of SLCFs. The distribution and lifetime of 
SLCFs are further influenced by the modulation of chemical and physical processes in response to a 
changing climate. Therefore, the time evolution of atmospheric abundance of SLCFs is characterized by 
many complex non-linear interactions occurring at varying temporal and spatial scales. For this assessment, 
global scale, long-term measurements are employed only for a few gaseous SLCFs while for most short-
lived species regional-scale observations and global models are relied upon.  
 
<boxref>Box 6.1</boxref> 
 
## 6.3.1  Methane (CH₄) 
 
The global mean surface mixing ratio of methane has increased by 156% since 1750 (see Section 2.2.3.4; 
Annex III). Since AR5, the methane mixing ratio has increased by about 3.5% from 1803±2 ppb in 2011 to 
1866±3 ppb in 2019 (see Section 2.2.3.3.2) largely driven by anthropogenic activities as assessed in Chapter 
5 (Section 5.2.2 and Cross-Chapter Box 5.2).  
 
An assessment of the global methane budget is provided in Chapter 5, while this section assesses methane 
atmospheric lifetime and perturbation time (Prather et al., 2001). AR5 based its assessment of methane 
lifetime on (Prather et al., 2012). The methane lifetime due to tropospheric OH, the primary sink of methane, 
was assessed to be 11.2 ± 1.3 years constrained by surface observations of methyl chloroform (MCF), and 
lifetimes due to stratospheric loss2, tropospheric halogen loss and soil uptake were assessed to be 150 ± 50 
years, 200 ± 100 years, 120 ± 24 years, respectively (Myhre et al., 2013b). Considering the full range of 
individual lifetimes, the total methane lifetime was assessed in AR5 to be 9.25 ± 0.6 years. 
 
The global chemical methane sink, essentially due to tropospheric OH, required to calculate the chemical 
lifetime is estimated by either bottom-up global CCMs and ESMs (BU) or top-down observational inversion 
methods (TD). BU global models represent the coupled chemical processes and feedbacks that determine the 
chemical sinks but show large diversity in their estimates, particularly the tropospheric OH sink (Zhao et al., 
2019b; Stevenson et al., 2020). TD inversion methods, on the contrary, provide independent observational 
constraints on methane sink due to tropospheric OH over large spatio-temporal scales, but are prone to 
observational uncertainties and do not account for the chemical feedbacks on OH (Prather and Holmes, 
2017; Naus et al., 2019). The central estimate of mean chemical methane loss over the period 2008-2017 
varies from 602 [minimum and maximum range of 507-803] Tg yr-1 from BU chemistry-climate models in 
the Chemistry Climate Modeling Initiative (CCMI) to 514 [474-529] Tg yr-1 from TD inverse modelling 
(also see section 5.2.2 and Table 5.2). The smaller range in TD estimate (11%) results from the use of a 
common climatological mean OH distribution (Saunois et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020a) while the larger 
range in BU estimate (49%) reflects the diversity in OH concentrations from different chemical mechanisms 
implemented in the global models (Zhao et al., 2019b). See Section 6.3.3 for further discussion on the 
conflicting information on OH from CCMs/ESMs and TD inversion approaches. Further work is required to 
reconcile differences between BU and TD estimates of the chemical methane sink.  
 
<tableref>6.2</tableref> 
 
The present-day BU methane chemical lifetime shows a larger spread than that in the TD estimates (Table 
6.2) in line with the spread seen in the sink estimates. The spread in the methane lifetime calculated by three 
CMIP6 ESMs is narrower and is enclosed within the spread of the BU CCMI model ensemble. Based on the 
consideration that the small imbalance in total methane sources versus sinks derived from TD estimates is 
close to the observed atmospheric methane growth rate (see Table 5.2), the TD values are assessed to be the 
best estimates for this assessment. The relative uncertainty (1-sigma) is taken to be the same as that in AR5, 
i.e., 11.8%, 33% and 10% for chemical, soil and total lifetime, respectively. The central estimate of the total 
atmospheric methane lifetime assessed here is the same as that in the AR5.  
 
The methane perturbation lifetime (τpert) is defined as the e-folding time it takes for methane burden to decay 
back to its initial value after being perturbed by a change in methane emissions. Perturbation lifetime is 
longer than the total atmospheric lifetime of methane as an increase in methane emissions decreases 
tropospheric OH which in turn decreases the lifetime and therefore the methane burden (Prather, 1994; 
Fuglestvedt et al., 1996; Holmes et al., 2013; Holmes, 2018). Since perturbation lifetime relates changes in 
emissions to changes in burden, it is used to determine the emissions metrics assessed in Chapter 7 Section 
7.6. The perturbation lifetime is related to the atmospheric lifetime as τpert = f * τtotal where f is the feedback 
factor and is calculated as f = 1/(1-s), where s = - δ (ln τtotal)/ δ (ln[CH₄]) (Prather et al., 2001). Since there 
are no observational constraints for either τpert or f, these quantities are derived from CCMs or ESMs. AR5 
used f = 1.34 ± 0.06 based on a combination of multimodel (mostly CTMs and a few CCMs) estimates 
(Holmes et al., 2013). A recent model study explored new aspects of methane feedbacks finding that the 
strength of the feedback, typically treated as a constant, varies in space and time but will in all likelihood 
remain within 10% over the 21st century (Holmes, 2018). For this assessment, the value of f is assessed to be 
1.30±0.07 based on a six member ensemble of AerChemMIP ESMs (Thornhill et al., 2021b). This f value is 
slightly smaller but within the range of the AR5 value. This results in an overall perturbation methane 
lifetime of 11.8 ± 1.8 years, within the range of the AR5 value of 12.4 ± 1.4 years. The methane perturbation 
lifetime assessed here is used in the calculation of emission metrics in Section 7.6. 


## 6.3.2  Ozone (O3) 
 
### 6.3.2.1  Tropospheric ozone  
 
About ten percent of the total atmospheric ozone column resides in the troposphere. The ozone forcing on 
climate strongly depends on its vertical and latitudinal distribution in troposphere. The lifetime of ozone in 
the troposphere ranges from a few hours in polluted urban regions to up to few months in the upper 
troposphere. Observed tropospheric ozone concentrations range from less than 10 ppb over the tropical 
Pacific Ocean to as much as 100 ppb in the upper troposphere and more than 100 ppb downwind of major 
ozone precursor emissions regions. An ensemble of five CMIP6 models including whole atmospheric 
chemistry and interactive ozone has been shown to simulate consistently the present-day ozone distribution 
(N-S and latitudinal gradients) and its seasonal variability when compared with observations from sondes, 
background surface stations and satellite products (Griffiths et al., 2020). The biases, whose magnitude is 
similar to AR5, are lower than 15% against climatological seasonal cycle from ozonesondes with an 
overestimate in the Northern Hemisphere and an underestimate in the Southern Hemisphere (Griffiths et al., 
2020). The CMIP6 multimodel ensemble estimate of the global mean lifetime of ozone for present day 
conditions is 25.5 ± 2.2 days (Griffiths et al., 2020) which is within the range of previous multi-model 
estimates (Stevenson et al., 2006; Young et al., 2013), indicating a high level of confidence. 
 
AR5 assessed the tropospheric ozone burden to be 337±23 Tg for year 2000 based on the ACCMIP 
ensemble of model simulations (Myhre et al., 2013b). Multiple satellites products, ozonesondes and CCMs 
are used to estimate tropospheric ozone burden (Table 6.3). Satellite products provide lower-bound values as 
they exclude regions under polar night conditions (Gaudel et al., 2018).  The tropospheric ozone burden 
values from multi-model exercises are within the range of the observational estimates despite different 
definitions of the tropopause for multi-model estimates which can lead to differences of about 10% on the 
ozone burden model estimates (Griffiths et al., 2020). Weighted by their number of members, CMIP6 and 
CCMI multimodel estimates and observational estimates of tropospheric ozone burden about year 2010, lead 
to an assessment of the tropospheric ozone burden of 347±28 Tg for 2010.   
 
The tropospheric ozone budget is controlled by chemical production and loss, by STE, and by deposition at 
the Earth’s surface, whose magnitude are calculated by CCMs (Table 6.3). Despite the high agreement of the 
model ensemble mean with observational estimates in present-day tropospheric ozone burden, the values of 
individual budget terms can vary widely across models in CMIP6 consistent with previous model 
intercomparison experiments (Young et al., 2018).  Furthermore, single-model studies have shown that the 
halogen chemistry, which is typically neglected from model chemistry schemes in CCMs, may have a 
notable impact on the ozone budget, as halogens, particularly of marine origin, take part in efficient ozone 
loss catalytic cycles in the troposphere (Saiz-Lopez et al., 2012; Sarwar et al., 2015; Sherwen et al., 2016). 
 
<tableref>6.3</tableref> 
 
Because of the heterogeneous distribution of ozone, limited observations or proxies do not provide accurate 
information about the global preindustrial abundance, posing a challenge to the estimation of the historical 
evolution of tropospheric ozone. Therefore, global CCMs complemented by observations are relied upon for 
estimating the long-term changes in tropospheric ozone. AR5 concluded that anthropogenic changes in 
ozone precursor emissions are unequivocally responsible for the increase between 1850 and present (Myhre 
et al., 2013b). Based on limited isotopic evidence, Chapter 2 assesses that the global tropospheric ozone 
increased by less than 40% between 1850 and 2005 (low confidence) (see Section 2.2.5.3). The CMIP6 
models are in line with this increase of tropospheric ozone with an ensemble mean value of 109± 25 Tg 
(model range) from 1850-1859 to 2005-2014 (Figure 6.4). This increase is higher than the AR5 value of 100 
± 25 Tg from 1850 to 2010 due to higher ozone precursor emissions in CMIP6. However, the AR5 and 
CMIP6 value are close when considering the reported uncertainties. The uncertainties are equivalent in 
CMIP6 and AR5 despite enhanced inclusion of coupled processes in the CMIP6 ESMs (e.g. biogenic VOC 
emissions or interactive stratospheric ozone chemistry).   
  
 
<figref>6.4</figref> 

Since the mid-20th century, the CMIP6 model ensemble shows a higher global trend (Figure 6.4). Since mid-
1990s, the trends are better documented by observations (see also Section 2.2.5.3) and indicate spatial 
heterogeneity. In particular, in-situ observations at remote surface sites and in the lower free troposphere 
indicate positive trends that are far more common than negative trends, especially in the northern tropics and 
across southern and eastern Asia (Figure 6.5). The CMIP6 ensemble and observations largely agree in the 
magnitude of the global positive trend since 1997 (0.82±0.13 Tg yr-1 in the model ensemble; 0.70±0.15 Tg 
yr-1 in ozonesonde dataset; 0.83± 0.85 Tg yr-1 in the satellite ensemble) and qualitatively reproduce positive 
trends in Southern Hemisphere (Griffiths et al., 2020). More analyses are needed for evaluation in other parts 
of the world to assess the skill of the recent ensemble based on CMIP6 emissions.  
 
<figref>6.5</figref> 
 
In summary, there is high confidence in the estimated present-day (about 2010) global tropospheric ozone 
burden based on an ensemble of models and observational estimates (347±28 Tg), but there is medium 
confidence among the individual models for their estimates of the tropospheric ozone related budget terms.  
Evidence from successive multi-model intercomparisons and the limited isotopic evidence agree on the 
magnitude of the increase of the tropospheric ozone burden from 1850 to present-day in response to 
anthropogenic changes in ozone precursor emissions corroborating AR5 findings. This increase is assessed 
to be 109±25 Tg (medium confidence). CMIP6 model ensemble shows a constant global increase since the 
mid-20th century whose rate is consistent with that derived from observations since the mid-1990s.  
 
 
### 6.3.2.2  Stratospheric ozone  
 
Ninety percent of total-column ozone resides in the stratosphere. The chemical lifetime of ozone in the 
stratosphere ranges from less than a day in the upper stratosphere to several months in the lower stratosphere 
(Bekki and Lefevre, 2009). Global stratospheric ozone trends based on observations are assessed in Chapter 
2 (Section 2.2.5.2). CMIP6 model ensemble shows that global total ozone column (TCO) has slightly 
changed from 1850 to 1960 (Keeble et al., 2021). The rapid decline in the 1970s and 1980s due to 
halogenated ODSs (as assessed in Chapter 2 Section 2.2.5.2 from observations) until the end of the 1990s 
followed by a slight increase since then is captured by the models (Keeble et al., 2021).  Overall the observed 
climatology patterns and annual cycle amplitudes, are well represented in the CMIP6 ensemble mean. 
CMIP6 ensemble overestimates the observed TCO values by up to 6% (10-20 DU) globally in the NH and 
SH mid-latitudes, and in the tropics, but the trend in these regions is well captured between 1960 and 2014. 
However, there is poor agreement between the individual CMIP6 models in the pre-industrial and throughout 
the historical period, with model TCO values spread across a range of ~60 DU. The global stratospheric 
ozone column decreased by 14.3±8.7 DU from 1850 to 2014 (Keeble et al., 2021).   
 
Model simulations attribute about half of the observed upper stratospheric ozone increase after 2000 to the 
decline of ODS since the late 1990s while the other half of the ozone increase is attributed to the slowing of 
gas-phase ozone destruction cycles due to cooling of the upper stratosphere by increasing GHGs (Aschmann 
et al., 2014; Oberländer-Hayn et al., 2015).  

In summary, global stratospheric ozone column has decreased from pre-industrial to present-day in response 
to the ODS-induced ozone rapid decline in the 1970s and 1980s followed by slow, and still incomplete, 
recovery. There is medium confidence that global stratospheric ozone column has changed by 14.3±8.7 DU 
between 1850 and 2014.  
 
 
## 6.3.3  Precursor Gases 
 
### 6.3.3.1  Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) 
 
The distribution of tropospheric NOx is highly variable in space and time owing to its short lifetime coupled 
with highly heterogeneous emission and sink patterns. NOx undergoes chemical processing, including the 
-), organic nitrates (e.g, alkyl nitrate, peroxyacyl nitrate), and 
formation of nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>), nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub>
atmospheric transport, and deposition. Despite challenges in retrieving quantitative information from satellite 
observations (Duncan et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2015; Lorente et al., 2017; Silvern et al., 2018), improved 
accuracy and resolution of satellite-derived tropospheric NO2 columns over the past two decades have 
advanced understanding of the global distribution, long-term trends, and source attribution of NOx. Long-
term average tropospheric NO2 column based on multiple satellites born instruments (Figure 6.6a) reveals 
highest NO2 levels over the most populated, urbanized, and industrialised regions of the world corresponding 
to high NOx emission source regions (Krotkov et al., 2016; Georgoulias et al., 2019). Enhanced but highly 
variable NO2 columns are also associated with biomass burning regions as well as areas influenced by 
lightning activity (Miyazaki et al., 2014; Tanimoto et al., 2015). 
 
Observational constraints derived from isotopic composition of atmospheric nitrate inferred from ice cores 
provide evidence of increasing anthropogenic NOx sources since pre-industrial times (Hastings et al., 2009; 
Geng et al., 2014). Global NOx emission trends in bottom-up inventories (Section 6.2.1) as well as model 
simulations of nitrogen deposition (Lamarque et al., 2013b) are in qualitative agreement with these 
observational constraints. CMIP6 ESMs exhibit stable NOx burden until early 1900s and then a sharp 
increase driven by a factor of three increase in emissions, however the magnitude of this increase remains 
uncertain due to poor observational constraints on pre-industrial concentrations of NOx  (Griffiths et al., 
2020). 
 
AR5 reported NO2 decreases by 30-50% in Europe and North America and increases by more than a factor 
of two in Asia over the 1996 to 2011 based on satellite observations (Hartmann et al., 2013). Extension of 
this analysis covering time period up to 2015 reveals that NO2 has continued to decline over the USA, 
western Europe, and Japan (Schneider et al., 2015; Duncan et al., 2016; Krotkov et al., 2016) because of 
effective fossil fuel NOx emission controls (Section 6.2), although this rate of decline has slowed down post-
2011 (Jiang et al., 2018b). Satellite observations also reveal a 32% decline in NO2 column over China after 
peaking in 2011 (see Figure 6.6b) consistent with declining NOx emissions (Section 6.2) due to the 
implementation of emission control strategies (de Foy et al., 2016; Irie et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016a). Over 
South Asia, tropospheric NO2 levels have grown rapidly with increases of 50% during 2005 to 2015 largely 
driven by hotspot areas in India experiencing rapid expansion of the power sector (Duncan et al., 2016; 
Krotkov et al., 2016). Further analysis indicates that many parts of India have also undergone a reversal in 
NO2 trends since 2011 that has been attributed to a combination of factors, including a slowdown in 
economic growth, implementation of cleaner technologies, non-linear NOx chemistry, and meteorological 
variability (Georgoulias et al., 2019). Satellite data reveals spatially heterogeneous NO2 trends over the 
Middle East with an overall increase over 2005-2010 and a decrease over large parts of the region after 
2011-2012. The reasons for trend reversal within individual areas are diverse, including warfare, imposed 
sanctions, and air quality controls (Lelieveld et al., 2015a; Georgoulias et al., 2019). Satellite-derived 
tropospheric NO2 levels over Africa and Latin America do not show a clear trend; both increasing and 
decreasing trends are observed over large agglomerations in these regions since the early 2000s (Schneider et 
al., 2015; Duncan et al., 2016).  
 
In summary, global tropospheric NOx abundance has increased from 1850 to 2015 (high confidence). 
Satellite observations of tropospheric NOx indicate strong regional variations in trends over 2005-2015. 

There is high confidence that NO2 has declined over the USA and western Europe since the mid 1990s and 
increased over China until 2011. NO2 trends have reversed (declining) over China beginning in 2012 and 
NO2 has increased over South Asia by 50% since 2005 (medium confidence).  
 
<figref>6.6</figref> 
 
### 6.3.3.2  Carbon Monoxide (CO) 
 
About half of the atmospheric CO burden is due to its direct emissions and the remainder is due to 
atmospheric oxidation of methane and NMVOCs. Reaction with OH is the primary sink of CO with a 
smaller contribution from dry deposition. 
 
Since AR5, advances in satellite retrievals (e.g. Worden et al., 2013; Warner et al., 2014; Buchholz et al., 
2021a), ground based column observations (e.g. Zeng et al., 2012; Té et al., 2016), airborne platforms (e.g. 
Cohen et al., 2018; Petetin et al., 2018), surface measurement networks (e.g., Andrews et al., 2014; Petron et 
al., 2019; Prinn et al., 2018; Schultz et al., 2015) and assimilation products (e.g., Deeter et al., 2017; 
Flemming et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2019) have resulted in better characterization of the present day 
atmospheric CO distribution. Typical annual mean surface CO concentrations range from ~120 ppb in the 
Northern Hemisphere to ~40 ppb in the Southern Hemisphere (Petron et al., 2019). The sub-regional patterns 
in CO reflect the distribution of emission sources. Seasonal hotspots are linked to areas of biomass burning 
in tropical South America, equatorial Africa, Southeast Asia, and Australia. A study using data assimilation 
techniques estimates a global mean CO burden of 356 ± 27 Tg over the 2002-2013 period (Gaubert et al., 
2017).  
 
Global models generally capture the global spatial distribution of the observed CO concentrations but have 
regional biases of up to 50% (e.g., Emmons et al., 2020; Horowitz et al., 2020). Despite updated emissions 
datasets, the global multi-model and single model simulations persistently underestimate observed CO 
concentrations at northern high- and mid-latitudes as well as in the Southern Hemisphere but with smaller 
biases compared with that in the Northern Hemisphere (Monks et al., 2015b; Naik et al., 2013b; Stein et al., 
2014; Strode et al., 2015). Models are biased high in the tropics, particularly over highly polluted areas in 
India and Eastern Asia (Strode et al., 2016; Yarragunta et al., 2017). 
 
Estimates of global CO burden simulated by global models generally fall within the range of that derived 
from data assimilation techniques, though the spread across the models is large ( Myriokefalitakis et al., 
2016; Naik et al., 2013b; Stein et al., 2014; Zeng et al., 2015). There is a large diversity in model simulated 
CO budget driven by uncertainties in CO sources and sinks, particularly those related to in situ production 
from NMVOCs and loss due to reaction with OH (Stein et al., 2014; Zeng et al., 2015; Myriokefalitakis et 
al., 2016). Global CO budget analysis from a multimodel ensemble for more recent years including results 
from the CMIP6 model runs are not yet available.  
 
Reconstructions of CO concentrations based on limited ice core samples in the Northern Hemisphere high 
latitudes suggest CO mole fractions of about 145 ppb in the 1950s, which rose by 10-15 ppb in the mid- 
1970s, and then declined by about 30 ppb to about 130 ppb by 2008 (Petrenko et al., 2013). The negative 
trends since the 1990s are often attributed to emission regulations from road transportation in North America 
and Europe.  Due to limited observations prior to the satellite era, our knowledge on long-term global CO 
trends are estimated using models. An increase of global CO burden of about 50% for the year 2000 relative 
to 1850 is found in CMIP6 (Griffiths et al., 2020).  
 
AR5 reported a global CO decline of about 1% yr-1 based on satellite data from 2002-2010, but biases in 
instruments rendered low confidence in this trend. AR5 also indicated a small CO decrease from in situ 
networks but did not provide quantitative estimates. New analysis of CO trends performed since AR5 and 
based on different observational platforms and assimilation products show a decline globally and over most 
regions during the last one to two decades with varying amplitudes partly depending on the period of 
analysis (Table 6.4). Inversion based analysis attribute the global CO decline during the past two decades to 
decreases in anthropogenic and biomass burning CO emissions despite probable increase in atmospheric CO 
chemical production (Gaubert et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2019). Furthermore, (Buchholz et 
al., 2021) report a slowdown in global CO decline in 2010-2018 compared to 2002-2010, although the 
magnitude and sign of this change in the trend varies regionally. Global models prescribed with emissions 
inventories developed prior to the CMIP6 inventory capture the declining observed CO trends over North 
America and Europe but not over East Asia (Strode et al., 2016). CMIP6 models driven by CMIP6 emissions 
simulate a negative trend in global CO burden over the 1990-2020 period (Griffiths et al., 2020), however 
the simulated trends have not yet been evaluated against observations.  
  
In summary, our understanding of present day global CO distribution has increased since AR5 with newer 
and improved observations and reanalysis. There is high confidence that global CO burden is declining since 2000.
Evidence from observational CO reanalysis suggests this decline to be driven by reductions in 
anthropogenic CO emissions, however this is yet to be corroborated by global ESM studies with the most 
recent emission inventories.

### 6.3.3.3  Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOCs)  
 
NMVOCs encompass thousands of compounds with lifetimes from hours to days to months and abundances 
and chemical composition highly variable with respect to space, time. Although the biogenic source (Section 
6.2.2) dominates the global NMVOC budget, anthropogenic activities are the main driver of long-term trends 
in the abundance of many compounds. 
 
Information on the global distribution of individual NMVOCs is scarce, except for the less reactive 
compounds having lifetimes of several days to months. Based on measurements from polar firn air samples 
and ground-based networks, AR5 reported that the abundances of the predominantly anthropogenic light 
alkanes (C2-C5) increased until 1980 and declined afterwards. The decline was attributed to air quality 
emission controls and to fugitive emission decreases following the collapse of the Soviet Union (Simpson et 
al., 2012). Since AR5, scarce ground-based measurements have shown that the decline in C2-C3 alkanes 
ended around 2008 and their abundances are since growing again, which is primarily attributed to increasing 
North American emissions (see Section 6.2.1). Furthermore, since AR5 the evolution of ethane levels during 
the past millennium was made accessible by analysis of ice core samples (Nicewonger et al., 2016). The 
large observed interpolar ratio of ethane in preindustrial times (3.9) corroborates a large geologic source of 
ethane previously put forward by (Etiope and Ciccioli, 2009), and narrows down its likely global magnitude 
(Nicewonger et al., 2018) (low to medium confidence). The incorporation of geologic emissions in CCMs is 
not yet systematic though a one-model study has shown improved agreement of the results with observations 
(Dalsøren et al., 2018).  
 
Formaldehyde is a short-lived high-yield product of NMVOC oxidation and formaldehyde column data from 
satellite instruments can therefore inform on trends in anthropogenic NMVOC abundances over very 
industrialized region. AR5 reported significant positive trends in HCHO between 1997 and 2009 over north-
eastern China (4% yr-1) and negative trends over north-eastern U.S. cities. Since AR5, there is robust 
evidence and high agreement of an upward trend of HCHO over eastern China, though large regional 
disparities exist in the trends (De Smedt et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2019) with possible negligible or decreasing 
trend over Beijing and the Pearl River Delta. In other world regions, in particular North America, there is 
limited to medium evidence for significant changes in the HCHO columns, except in regions where the trend 
is particularly strong, e.g. the Houston area (-2.2% yr-1 over 2005-2014) and the Alberta oil sands (+3.8% yr-
1) (Zhu et al., 2017). Over the north-eastern U.S., even the sign of the trend differs between studies (De 
Smedt et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2017) for reasons that are unclear.  
 
In summary, after a decline between 1980 and 2008, abundances of light NMVOCs have increased again 
over the Northern Hemisphere due to extraction of oil and gas in North America (high confidence). Trends in 
satellite HCHO observations, used as a proxy of anthropogenic NMVOC over industrialised areas, show a 
significant positive trend over Eastern China (high confidence) but also indicate large regional disparities in 
the magnitude of the trends over China and even in their signs over North America. 
 
 
### 6.3.3.4  Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>)  
 
Ammonia is the most abundant alkaline gas in the atmosphere. Its present-day source is dominated by 
livestock and crop production (section 6.2). Ammonia reacts with nitric acid and sulphuric acid to produce 
ammonium sulphate and ammonium nitrate, which contribute to the aerosol burden (see section 6.3.5.2), 
promotes aerosol nucleation by stabilizing sulphuric acid clusters (Kirkby et al., 2011) and contributes to 
nitrogen deposition (see section 6.4.4) (Sheppard et al., 2011; Flechard et al., 2020). Trends in NH<sub>3</sub> were not 
assessed in AR5. 
 
Considerable expansion of satellite (Clarisse et al., 2009; Shephard and Cady-Pereira, 2015; Warner et al., 
2016) and ground-based observations (Miller et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2018) has improved our 
understanding of the spatial distribution and seasonal to inter-annual variability of ammonia, and advanced 
its representations in models (e.g., Zhu et al., 2015). Regionally, peak NH<sub>3</sub> concentrations are observed over 
large agricultural (e.g., Northern India, US Midwest and Central Valley) and biomass burning regions, in 
good qualitative agreement with emission inventories (Van Damme et al., 2015, Van Damme et al., 2018). 
However, several large agricultural and industrial hotspots have been found to be missing or greatly 
underestimated in emission inventories (Van Damme et al., 2018). NH<sub>3</sub> exhibits a strong vertical gradient, 
with a maximum in the boundary layer (Schiferl et al., 2016) and can be transported into the upper 
troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS), particularly in the Asian Monsoon region, as indicated by 
observations (Froyd et al., 2009; Höpfner et al., 2016, 2019) and theoretical considerations (Ge et al., 2018). 
There is a large range in the present-day NH<sub>3</sub> burden (from 0.04 to 0.7 TgN) simulated by CCMs, 
highlighting deficiencies in the process-level representation of NH<sub>3</sub> in current global models (Bian et al., 
2017). The underestimate of surface NH<sub>3</sub> concentrations (Bian et al., 2017) further highlights such 
deficiencies and the limitations in comparing site-specific observations with relatively coarse-resolution 
models. 
 
Observations show that NH<sub>3</sub> concentration has been increasing in recent decades in the USA (Butler et al., 
2016; Warner et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2018), western Europe (van Zanten et al., 2017; Warner et al., 2017, 
Wichink Kruit et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2018b), and China (Warner et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018). This trend 
has been attributed to a combination of increasing ammonia emissions (Sutton et al., 2013; Fowler et al., 
2015) and decreases in the chemical reaction of NH<sub>3</sub> with nitric and sulphuric acids associated with 
reductions in SO₂ and NOx emissions whose rate depends on the region (Warner et al., 2017; Yao and Zhang, 
2019). Over longer time scales, CCMs simulate an increase of the NH<sub>3</sub> burden by a factor of 2 to 7 since 
preindustrial conditions (Xu and Penner, 2012; Hauglustaine et al., 2014).  
 
In summary, progress has been made in the understanding of the spatio-temporal distribution of ammonia, 
though representation of NH<sub>3</sub> remains rather unsatisfactory due to process-level uncertainties. Evidence from 
observations and models suggests that ammonia concentrations have been increasing over the recent decades 
due to emissions and chemistry. There is high confidence that the global NH<sub>3</sub> burden has increased 
considerably from preindustrial to present-day although the magnitude of the increase remains uncertain. 
 
 
### 6.3.3.5 Sulphur Dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>)
 
AR5 did not assess trends in SO₂ concentrations. Trends in SO₂ abundances are consistent with the overall 
anthropogenic emission changes as presented in Section 6.2 and Figure 6.18. Long-term surface-based in situ 
observations in North America and Europe show reductions of more than 80% since the measurements 
began around 1980 (Table 6.5). Europe had the largest reductions in the first part of the period while the 
highest reduction came later in North America. Observed trends are qualitatively reproduced by global and 
regional models over North America and Europe over the period 1990-2015 for which emission changes are 
well quantified (Table 6.5) (Aas et al., 2019). 
 
In situ observations over other parts of the world are scattered. However, the limited in-situ observations in 
East Asia indicate an increase in atmospheric SO₂ up to around 2005 and then a decline (Aas et al., 2019). 
This is confirmed by satellite observations (Krotkov et al., 2016), which further reveal a rapid decline in SO₂ 
since 2012 to 2013 (Krotkov et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2018b). In India, on the other hand, the SO₂ levels 
have doubled over 2005 to 2015 (Krotkov et al., 2016).  
 
In summary, surface and satellite observations indicate strong regional variations in trends of atmospheric 
SO₂ abundance. The SO₂ concentrations in North America and Europe have declined over 1980 to 2015 with 
slightly stronger reductions in North America (70 ± 20%) than over Europe (58 ± 32%) over 2000-2015, 
though Europe had larger reductions than the US in the prior decade (1990-2000). In Asia, the SO₂ trends are 
more scattered, though there is medium confidence that there was a strong increase up to around 2005, 
followed by a steep decline in China, while over India, the concentrations are increasing steadily.

## 6.3.4  Short-lived Halogenated Species  
 
The halogenated species are emitted in the atmosphere in the form of the synthetically produced 
chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFCs), halons, hydrochloroﬂuorocarbons (HCFCs), hydroﬂuorocarbons (HFCs) and 
others. Their historical global abundances are provided in Annex III and discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 
2.2.4, Table 2.3). In summary, for the period 2011-2019, the abundance of total chlorine from HCFCs has 
continued to increase in the atmosphere with decreased growth rates, total tropospheric bromine from halons 
and methyl bromide continued to decrease while abundances of most currently measured HFCs increased 
significantly, consistent with expectations based on the ongoing transition away from the use of ODSs. Here, 
emphasis is given on the very short-lived halogenated species (VSLSs). The trends for these species were not 
discussed in IPCC AR5.  
 
VSLSs are halogenated substances with atmospheric lifetimes less than 0.5 year. While longer-lived ODSs 
account for most of the present day stratospheric halogen loading, there is robust evidence that VSLSs 
contribute to stratospheric bromine and chlorine (Carpenter et al., 2014; Hossaini et al., 2015; Leedham 
Elvidge et al., 2015b) thus also contributing to stratospheric ozone depletion.  
 
Of the atmospheric VSLSs, brominated and iodinated species are predominantly of oceanic origin, while 
chlorinated species have significant additional anthropogenic sources (Carpenter et al., 2014; Hossaini et al., 
2015). Global mean chlorine from the VSLSs has increased in the troposphere from about 91 ppt in 2012 to 
about 110 ppt in 2016 (Engel et al., 2018).  This increase is mostly due to dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), a 
species that has predominantly anthropogenic sources reflected by 3-times higher concentrations in the 
Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere (Hossaini et al., 2017). The upward dichloromethane 
trend is corroborated by upper tropospheric aircraft data over the period 1998-2014 (Leedham Elvidge et al., 
2015a; Oram et al., 2017). The observations from the surface networks show that the abundance of 
dichloromethane continued to increase until 2019 (Annex III), although the accuracy of global abundance of 
VSLSs is limited by the limited coverage by networks. No long-term change of the bromine containing 
VSLSs have been observed (Engel et al., 2018). 
 
 
## 6.3.5  Aerosols  
 
This section assesses trends in atmospheric distribution of aerosols and improvements in relevant physical 
and chemical processes. The observed large-scale temporal evolution of aerosols is assessed in Section 2.2.6. 
Since AR5, long term measurements of aerosol mass concentrations from regional global surface networks 
have continued to expand and provide information on the distribution and trends in aerosols (Figure 6.7). 
There is large spatial variability in aerosol mass concentration, expressed as PM2.5, dominant aerosol type 
and aerosol composition, consistent with the findings in AR5.  
 
<figref>6.7</figref> 
 
Remote sensing instruments provide a larger-scale view of aerosol distributions and trends than ground-
based monitoring networks by retrieving the Aerosol optical depth (AOD), which is indirectly related to 
aerosol mass concentrations. AOD is the column-integrated aerosol mass extinction at a given wavelength, 
and is therefore relevant to the estimation of the radiative forcing of aerosol-radiation interactions (Section 
7.3.3.1). Models participating in Phase III of the AeroCom intercomparison project were found to 
underestimate present-day AOD by about 20% (Gliß et al., 2020), although different remote sensing 
estimates obtain different estimates of global mean AOD. Gliß et al. (2020) also highlight the considerable 
diversity in the simulated contribution of various aerosol types to total AOD. However, models simulate 
regional trends in AODs that agree well, when expressed as percentage change, with ground- (Gliß et al., 
2020; Mortier et al., 2020) and satellite-based (Cherian and Quaas, 2020a; Gliß et al., 2020) observations. 
AOD trends simulated by CMIP6 models are more consistent with satellite-derived trends than CMIP5 
models for several subregions, thanks to improved emission estimates (Cherian and Quaas, 2020b).  
 
All CMIP6 models simulate a positive trend in global mean AOD since 1850, with a strong increase after the 
1950s coinciding with the massive increase in anthropogenic SO₂ emissions (Figure 6.8). Global mean AOD 
increases have slowed since 1980, or even reversed in some models, as a result of a compensation between 
SO₂ emission decreases over the United States and Europe in response to air quality controls since the mid-
1980s and increases over Asia. Since the mid-2000s, global mean AOD stabilized driven by soaring 
emissions in South Asia, and declining emissions in East Asia (section 6.2.1). Trends post ~2010 are difficult 
to assess from CMIP6 models since the historical simulations end at 2014. Nevertheless, the strong decline 
in anthropogenic SO₂ emissions over East Asia since 2011 is underestimated in the CMIP6 emission 
database (Hoesly et al., 2018) indicating that the observed AOD change over East Asia may not be captured 
accurately by CMIP6 models (Wang et al., 2021). While all CMIP6 models simulate increase of AOD 
between 1850 and 2014 there is strong inter-model diversity in the simulated AOD change since 1850 
ranging from 0.01 (15%) to 0.08 (53%) in 2014. Some models therefore lie outside the 68% confidence 
interval of 0.02 (15%) to 0.04 (or 30%) for global AOD change in 2005-2015 compared to 1850 estimated 
by (Bellouin et al., 2020) based on observational and model (excluding CMIP6) lines of evidence. In 
addition to the horizontal distribution of aerosols documented by AOD, their number size distribution, 
vertical distribution, optical properties, hygroscopicity, ability to act as CCN, chemical composition, mixing 
state and morphology are key elements to assess their climate effect (see Section 6.4.).  
 
<figref>6.8</figref> 
 
### 6.3.5.1  Sulphate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>)
 
Sulphate aerosols (or sulphate containing aerosols) are emitted directly or formed in the atmosphere by gas 
and aqueous phase oxidation of precursor sulphur gases, including SO₂, DMS, and carbonyl sulphide (OCS), 
emitted from anthropogenic and natural sources (Section 6.2). Sulphate aerosols influence climate forcing 
directly by either scattering solar radiation or absorbing longwave radiation, and indirectly by influencing 
cloud micro- and macrophysical properties and precipitation (Boucher et al., 2013; Myhre et al., 2013b). 
Additionally, sulphate aerosols and sulphate deposition have a large impact on air quality and ecosystems 
(Reis et al., 2012). The majority of sulphate particles are formed in the troposphere, however, SO₂ and other 
longer-lived natural precursors, such as OCS, transported into the stratosphere contribute to the background 
stratospheric aerosol layer (Kremser et al., 2016). SO₂ emissions from volcanic eruptions are a significant 
source of stratospheric sulphate loading (see Chapter 2 for reconstruction of stratospheric aerosol optical 
depth and Chapter 7 for radiative forcing of volcanic aerosols). Furthermore, studies suggest contributions 
from anthropogenic SO₂ emissions transported into the stratosphere with a consequent impact on radiative 
forcing (Myhre et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2016). However there is significant uncertainty in the relative 
importance of this stratospheric sulphate source (Kremser et al., 2016). 
 
Process understanding of sulphate production pathways from SO₂ emissions has seen some progress since 
AR5. More specifically, many global climate models now have a more complete description of chemical 
reactions such that oxidant levels s (including ozone) are better described, include a pH-dependence of SO₂ 
oxidation (e.g., Bauer et al., 2020; Kirkevåg et al., 2018), and implement explicit descriptions of ammonium 
and nitrate aerosol components, which may influence the partitioning of sulphate (Bian et al., 2017; Lund et 
al., 2018). The pH influences the heterogeneous chemistry as well as the physical properties of the aerosols, 
and this topic has been a subject of growing interest since AR5 (Cheng et al., 2016; Freedman et al., 2019; 
Nenes et al., 2020). Increases in cloudwater pH have been shown to significantly increase the radiative 
forcing of sulphates (Turnock et al., 2019).   
 
Sulphate is removed from the atmosphere by dry deposition and wet scavenging, and these processes depend 
on the characteristics of the Earth’s surface, and the intensity, frequency and amount of precipitation 
(Boucher et al., 2013). Even though there have been some improvements since AR5, model representation of 
wet scavenging and related cloud processes, and atmospheric transport remains a key source of uncertainty 
in the simulated aerosol distribution and lifetime with further consequences for the sulphate forcing estimates 
(Kristiansen et al., 2016; Lund et al., 2018a). There are also still relatively large uncertainties in the emission 
height used in models affecting the simulated aerosol distribution (Yang et al., 2019). 
 
Based on long-term surface-based in situ observations, AR5 reported strong decline in sulphate aerosols in 
Europe and the USA over 1990 to 2009, with the largest decreases occurring before 2000 in Europe and post 
2000 in the USA. Since AR5, atmospheric measurements in conjunction with model results have provided 
insights into the spatial and temporal distribution of sulphate and sulphur deposition (Vet et al., 2014; Tan et 
al., 2018; Aas et al., 2019). The in situ observations in North America and Europe reveal substantial 
reduction since the measurements started around 1980, though the trends have not been linear through this 
period (Table 6.5). Several regional studies agree with these trend estimates for Europe (Banzhaf et al., 
2015b; Theobald et al., 2019) and North America (Sickles II and Shadwick, 2015; Paulot et al., 2016a). 
Further, the concentrations of primary emitted SO₂ (Section 6.3.3.5) show greater decreases than secondary 
sulphate aerosols over these regions due to a combination of higher oxidation rate (hence more SO₂ 
2-) and increased dry deposition rate of SO₂ (Fowler et al., 2009; Banzhaf et al., 2015). In 
converted to SO4
situ observations over other parts of the world are scattered (see Figure 6.7), and the lack of observations 
makes it too uncertain to quantify regional representative trends (Hammer et al., 2018).  However, limited in-
situ observations in East Asia indicate an increase in atmospheric sulphate up to around 2005 and then a 
decline (Aas et al., 2019) which is confirmed by satellite observations of SO₂ (Section 6.3.3.5). In India, on 
the other hand satellite observations indicate a rapid increase in the SO₂ levels (Krotkov et al., 2016), and 
long-term measurements of sulphate in precipitation in India further provide evidence of an increasing trend 
from 1980 to 2010 (Bhaskar and Rao, 2017; Aas et al., 2019). Further improvements in global trend 
assessments are expected with new integrated reanalysis products from the Earth-system data assimilation 
projects (Randles et al., 2017; Inness et al., 2019).  
 
Indirect evidence of decadal trends in the atmospheric loading of sulphur are provided by Alpine ice cores, 
mainly influenced by European sources (Engardt et al., 2017), and ice cores from Svalbard (Samyn et al., 
2012) and Greenland (Patris et al., 2002; Iizuka et al., 2018) influenced by sources in Europe and North 
America. These show similar patterns with a weak increase from the end of the 19th century up to around 
1950 followed by a steep increase up to around 1980, and then a significant decrease over the next two 
decades. This general trend is consistent with the emissions of SO₂ in North America and Europe (Hoesly et 
al., 2018; Figures 6.18; 6.19). 
 
Global and regional models qualitatively reproduce observed trends over North America and Europe for the 
period 1990-2015 for which emission changes are generally well quantified (Aas et al., 2019; Mortier et al., 
2020), building confidence in the relationship between emissions, concentration, deposition and radiative 
forcing derived from these models. Though, the models seem to systematically underestimate sulphate (Bian 
et al., 2017; Lund et al., 2018a) and AOD (Lund et al., 2018a; Gliß et al., 2020), and there are quite large 
differences in the models’ distribution of the concentration fields of sulphate driven by differences in the 
representation of photochemical production and sinks of aerosols. One global model study also highlighted 
biases in simulated sulphate trends over the 2001-2015 period over eastern China due to uncertainties in the 
CEDS anthropogenic SO₂ emissions trends (Paulot et al., 2018). 
 
In summary, there is high confidence that the global tropospheric sulphate burden increased from 1850 to 
around 2005, but there are large regional differences in the magnitude. Sulphate aerosol concentrations in 
North America and Europe have declined over 1980 to 2015 with slightly stronger reductions in North 
America (47%) than over Europe (40%) over 2000-2015, though Europe had larger reductions in the prior 
decade (1990-2000), 52% and 21% respectively for Europe and North America. In Asia, the trends are more 
scattered, though there is medium confidence that there was a strong increase up to around 2005, followed by 
a steep decline in China, while over India, the concentrations are increasing steadily. 

### 6.3.5.2  Ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) and Nitrate Aerosols (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>)
 
Ammonium sulphate and ammonium nitrate aerosols are formed when NH<sub>3</sub> reacts with nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) 
and sulphuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) produced in the atmosphere by the oxidation of NOx and SO₂, respectively. 
Ammonium nitrate is formed only after H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is fully neutralized. NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> aerosols produced via
these gas-to-particle reactions are a major fraction of fine-mode particles (with diameter < 1µm) affecting air 
quality and climate. Coarse-mode nitrate, formed by the heterogeneous reaction of nitric acid with dust and 
sea salt, dominates the overall global nitrate burden, but has little radiative effect (Hauglustaine et al., 2014; 
Bian et al., 2017). Trends in ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) AND nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>) were not assessed in AR5.
 
Global model present-day estimates of the global NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> burden range from 0.1 to 0.6 TgN (Bian et al., 2017).
Models generally simulate surface NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentrations better than surface NH<sub>3</sub> concentrations (Bian et al.,
2017), which reflects its thermodynamic control by SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2–</sup> rather than NH<sub>3</sub> (Shi et al., 2017). The concomitant
increases of NH<sub>3</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and NOx emissions (see Section 6.2) have led to a factor of 3 to 9 increase in the 
simulated NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> burden from 1850 to 2000 (Hauglustaine et al., 2014; Lund et al., 2018a), driven primarily 
by ammonium sulphate (70-90%). The increases in the NH<sub>3</sub> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> burdens are indirectly supported by 
the observed increase of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentration in ice cores in mid to high latitudes (Kang et al., 2002; Kekonen 
et al., 2005; Lamarque et al., 2013a; Iizuka et al., 2018).  
 
Ammonium nitrate is semi-volatile, which results in complex spatial and temporal patterns in its 
concentrations (Putaud et al., 2010; Hand et al., 2012a; Zhang et al., 2012b) reflecting variations in its 
precursors, NH<sub>3</sub> and HNO<sub>3</sub>, as well as SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2–</sup>, non-volatile cations, temperature and relative humidity (Nenes 
et al., 2020). High relative humidity and low temperature as well as elevated fine particulate matter loading 
(Huang et al., 2014; Petit et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016; Sandrini et al., 2016) favour nitrate production. 
Measurements reveal high contribution of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> to surface PM2.5 (>30%) in regions with elevated regional 
NOx  and NH<sub>3</sub> emissions, such as the Paris area (Beekmann et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2019), northern Italy 
(Masiol et al., 2015; Ricciardelli et al., 2017), Salt Lake City (Kuprov et al., 2014; Franchin et al., 2018), the 
North China Plains (Guo et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2016), and New Delhi (Pant et al., 2015). Recent 
observations also show that ammonium nitrate contributes to the Asian tropopause aerosol layer (Vernier et 
al., 2018; Höpfner et al., 2019). Model diversity in simulating present-day global fine-mode NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> burden is 
large with two multimodel intercomparison studies reporting estimates in the range of 0.14-1.88 Tg and 
0.08-0.93 Tg, respectively (Bian et al., 2017; Gliß et al., 2021). Models differ in their estimates of the global 
tropospheric nitrate burden by up to a factor of 13 with differences remain nearly the same across CMIP5 
and CMIP6 generation of models (Bian et al., 2017; Gliß et al., 2021). While regional patterns in the 
concentration of fine-mode NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> are qualitatively captured by models, the simulation of fine-mode NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> is
generally worse than that of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> or SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2–</sup> (Bian et al., 2017). This can be partly attributed to the semi-
volatile nature of ammonium nitrate and biases in the simulation of its precursors (Heald et al., 2014; Paulot 
et al., 2016), including the sub-grid scale heterogeneity in NOx and NH<sub>3</sub> emissions (Zakoura and Pandis, 
2018).   

Models indicate that the burden of fine-mode NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> has increased by a factor of 2-5 from 1850 to 2000 (Xu 
and Penner, 2012; Hauglustaine et al., 2014; Lund et al., 2018a), an increase that has accelerated between 
2001 and 2015 (Lund et al., 2018a; Paulot et al., 2018). The sensitivity of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> to changes in NH<sub>3</sub>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2–</sup>, and 
HNO<sub>3</sub> is determined primarily by aerosol pH, temperature, and aerosol liquid water (Guo et al., 2016, 2018; 
Weber et al., 2016; Nenes et al., 2020). In regions, where aerosol pH is high, changes in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> follow changes 
in NOx emissions, consistent with the observed increase of ammonium nitrate in Northern China from 2000 
to 2015 (Wen et al., 2018) and its decrease in the US Central Valley (Pusede et al., 2016). In contrast, the 
decrease in SO₂ emissions in the US Southeast has caused little change in NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> from 1998 to 2014 as nitric 
acid largely remains in the gas phase due to highly acidic aerosols (Weber et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2018).  
 
In summary, there is high confidence that the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> burdens have increased from preindustrial to
present-day, although the magnitude of the increase is uncertain especially for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>. The sensitivity of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>
and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup> to changes in NH<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and HNO<sub>3</sub> is well understood theoretically. However, it remains 
challenging to represent in models in part because of uncertainties in the simulation of aerosol pH and only a 
minority of ESMs consider nitrate aerosols in CMIP6. 
 
### 6.3.5.3  Carbonaceous Aerosols  
 
Carbonaceous aerosols are black carbon (BC)3, which is soot made almost purely of carbon, and organic 
aerosols4 (OA), which also contain hydrogen and oxygen and can be of both primary (POA) or secondary 
(SOA) origin. BC and a fraction of OA called Brown Carbon (BrC) absorb solar radiation. The various 
components of carbonaceous aerosols have different optical properties, so the knowledge of their partition, 
mixing, coating and ageing is essential to assess their climate effect (see Section 7.3.3.1.2).   
 
Carbonaceous aerosols receive attention in the scientific and policy arena due to their radiative forcing, and 
their sizeable contribution to PM in an air quality context (Rogelj et al., 2014b; Harmsen et al., 2015; 
Shindell et al., 2016; Haines et al., 2017a; Myhre et al., 2017). BC exerts a positive ERF, but the ERF of 
carbonaceous aerosol as a whole is negative (Bond et al., 2013; Thornhill et al., 2021b).  On average, 
carbonaceous aerosols accounts for 50 to 70% of PM with diameter lower than 1 µm in polluted and pristine 
areas (Zhang et al., 2007; Carslaw et al., 2010; Andreae et al., 2015; Monteiro dos Santos et al., 2016; Chen 
et al., 2017). 
 
An extensive review on BC (Bond et al., 2013) discussed limitations in inferring its atmospheric abundance 
and highlighted inconsistencies between different terminology and related measurement techniques (Petzold 
et al., 2013; Sharma et al., 2017). Due to a lack of global observations, AR5 only reported declining total 
carbonaceous aerosol trends from USA and declining BC trend from the Arctic based on data available up to 2008.
Since AR5, the number of observation sites has grown worldwide (see also Figure 6.7) but datasets 
suitable for global trend analyses remain limited (Reddington et al., 2017; Laj et al., 2020). Locally, studies 
based on observations from rural and background sites have reported decreasing surface carbonaceous 
aerosol trends in the Arctic, Europe, USA, Japan and India (Table 6.6). Increases in carbonaceous aerosol 
concentrations in some rural sites of the Western USA have been associated with wildfires (Hand et al., 
2013; Malm et al., 2017).  Long-term OA observations are scarce, so their trends outside of the USA are 
difficult to assess. Ice-core analysis have provided insight into carbonaceous aerosol trends predating the 
satellite and observation era over the Northern Hemisphere (Section 2.2.6, Figure 2.9b).  
 
<tableref>6.6</tableref> 
 
Knowledge of carbonaceous aerosol atmospheric abundance continues to rely on global models due to a lack 
of global scale observations. For BC, models agree within a factor of two with measured surface mass 
concentrations in Europe and North America, but underestimate concentrations at the Arctic surface by one 
to two orders or magnitude, especially in winter and spring (Lee et al., 2013a; Lund et al., 2018a). For OA, 
AeroCom models underestimate surface mass concentrations by a factor 2 over urban areas, as their low 
horizontal resolution prevents them for resolving local pollution peaks (Tsigaridis et al., 2014; Lund et al., 
2018a). Models agree within a factor of two with OA surface concentrations measured at remote sites, where 
surface concentrations are more spatially uniform (Tsigaridis et al., 2014).  
 
Lifetimes in models are estimated to 5.5 days ±35% for BC and 6.0 days ±29% for OA (median ± 1 standard 
deviation) according to an ensemble of 14 models (Gliß et al., 2021). Disagreement in simulated lifetime 
leads to horizontal and vertical variations in predicted carbonaceous aerosol concentrations, with  
implications for radiative forcing (Lund et al., 2018b) (Samset et al., 2013). Airborne campaigns have 
provided valuable vertical profile measurements of carbonaceous aerosol concentrations (Schwarz et al., 
2013; Freney et al., 2018; Hodgson et al., 2018; Morgan et al., 2019; Schulz et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2019a). 
Compared to those measurements, models tend to transport BC too high in the atmosphere, suggesting that 
lifetimes are not larger than 5.5 days (Samset et al., 2013; Lund et al., 2018b). Newly developed size-
dependent wet scavenging parameterisation for BC (Taylor et al., 2014; Schroder et al., 2015; Ohata et al., 
2016; Zhang et al., 2017a; Ding et al., 2019; Moteki et al., 2019; Motos et al., 2019) may lead to decreased 
BC lifetimes and improve agreement with observed vertical profiles.  
  
Simulated BC burdens show a large spread among models (Gliß et al., 2021), despite using harmonised 
primary emissions, because of differences in BC removal efficiency linked to different treatment of ageing 
and mixing, particularly in strong source regions. The multi-model median BC burden for the year 2010 
from Gliß et al. (2021), based on 14 AeroCom models, is 0.131 ± 0.047 Tg (median ± standard deviation). 
That range encompasses values reported by independent single model estimates (Huang et al., 2013; Lee et 
al., 2013b; Sharma et al., 2013b; Wang et al., 2014a; Tilmes et al., 2019).  
 
Simulated OA burdens also show a large spread among global models, with Gliß et al. (2021) reporting a 
multi-model median of 1.91 ±0.65 Tg for the year 2010.  This large spread reflects the wide range in the 
complexity of the OA parameterizations, particularly for SOA formation, as well as in the primary OA 
emissions (Tsigaridis et al., 2014; Gliß et al., 2021). The uncertainties are particularly large in model 
estimates of SOA production rates, which vary between 10 and 143 Tg yr-1 (Tsigaridis et al., 2014; Hodzic et 
al., 2016; Tilmes et al., 2019). While the level of complexity in the representation of OA in global models 
has increased since AR5 (Shrivastava et al., 2017; Hodzic et al., 2020) limitations in process level 
understanding of the formation, aging and removal of organic compounds lead to uncertainties in the global 
model predictions of global OA burden and distribution as well as the relative contribution of POA and SOA 
to OA. Jo et al. (2016) estimated that BrC contributes about 20% of total OA burden. That would give BrC a 
burden similar to that of BC (low confidence), enhancing the overall forcing exerted by carbonaceous aerosol 
absorption (Zhang et al., 2020). 
 
In summary, the lack of global scale observations of carbonaceous aerosol, its complex atmospheric 
chemistry, and the large spread in its simulated global budget and burdens means that there is only low 
confidence in the quantification of the present-day atmospheric distribution of individual components of 
carbonaceous aerosols. Global trends in carbonaceous aerosols cannot be characterised due to limited 
observations, but sites representative of background conditions have reported multi-year declines in BC over 
several regions of the Northern Hemisphere. 
 
 
## 6.3.6 Implications of SLCF abundances for Atmospheric Oxidizing Capacity 
 
The atmospheric oxidising capacity is determined primarily by tropospheric hydroxyl (OH) radical and to a 
smaller extent by NO<sub>3</sub> radical, ozone, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and halogen radicals. OH is the main sink 
for many SLCFs, including methane, halogenated compounds (HCFCs and HFCs), CO and NMVOCs, 
controlling their lifetimes and consequently their abundance and climate influence. OH initiated oxidation of 
methane, CO and NMVOCs in the presence of NOx leads to the production of tropospheric ozone. OH also 
contributes to the formation of aerosols from oxidation of SO₂ to sulphate and VOCs to secondary organic 
aerosols. The evolution of atmospheric oxidising capacity of the Earth driven by human activities and natural 
processes is, therefore, of significance for climate and air quality concerns.  
 
The main source of tropospheric OH is the photoexcitation of tropospheric ozone that creates an 
electronically excited oxygen atom which reacts with water vapour producing OH. A secondary source of 
importance for global OH is the recycling of peroxy radicals formed by the reaction of OH with reduced and 
partly oxidized species, including methane, CO and NMVOCs. In polluted air, NOx emissions control the 
secondary OH production, while in pristine air it occurs via other mechanisms involving, in particular, 
isoprene (Lelieveld et al., 2016; Wennberg et al., 2018). Knowledge of the effect of isoprene oxidation on 
OH recycling has evolved tremendously over the past decade facilitating mechanistic explanation of elevated 
OH concentrations observed in locations characterised by low NOx levels (Hofzumahaus et al., 2009; Paulot 
et al., 2009; Peeters et al., 2009, 2014; Fuchs et al., 2013). Since AR5, inclusion of improved chemical 
mechanisms in some CTMs suggest advances in understanding of the global OH budget, however these 
improvements have yet to be incorporated in CMIP6-generation ESMs.   
 
As a result of the complex photochemistry, tropospheric OH abundance is sensitive to changes in SLCF 
emissions as well as climate. Increases in methane, CO, NMVOCs reduce OH while increases in water 
vapour and temperature, incoming solar radiation, NOx and tropospheric ozone enhance OH. The OH level 
thus responds to climate change and climate variability via its sensitivity to temperature and water vapour as 
well as the influence of climate on natural emissions (e.g., wetland methane emissions, lightning NOx, 
BVOCs, fire emissions) with consequent feedbacks on climate (Section 6.4.5). Climate modes of variability, 
like ENSO, also contribute to OH variability via changes in lightning NOx emissions and deep convection 
(Turner et al., 2018), and fire emissions (Rowlinson et al., 2019).  
 
Global scale OH observations are non-existent because of its extremely short lifetime (~1 s) and therefore 
global OH abundance and its time variations are either inferred from atmospheric measurements of methyl 
chloroform (MCF) (Prinn et al., 2018 and references therein) or derived from global atmospheric chemistry 
models (Lelieveld et al., 2016). AR5 reported small interannual OH variations in the 2000s based on 
atmospheric inversions of MCF observations (within ±5%) and global CCMs and CTMs (within ±3%) (Ciais 
et al., 2013).  

Since AR5, there is much closer agreement in the estimates of interannual variations in global mean OH 
derived from atmospheric inversions, empirical reconstruction, and global CCMs and ESMs with an estimate 
of 2 to 3% over the 1980 to 2015 period (Table 6.7). While the different methodologies agree on the 
occurrence of small inter-annual variations, there is much debate over longer term global OH trend. Two 
studies using multi-box model inversions of MCF and methane observations suggest large positive and 
negative trends since 1990s in global mean OH (Rigby et al., 2017; Turner et al., 2017), however, both find 
that observational constraints are weak such that a wide range of multi-annual OH variations are possible. 
Indeed, (Naus et al., 2019) find an overall positive global OH trend over the past two decades (Table 6.7) 
after accounting for uncertainties and biases in atmospheric MCF and CH₄ inversions confirming the 
weakness in observational constraints for deriving OH trends. Global ESMs, CCMs and CTMs exhibit 
stabilized or increasing global OH after 1980 contrary to the lack of trend derived from some atmospheric 
inversions and empirical reconstructions (Table 6.7). In particular, a three member ensemble of ESMs 
participating in the AerChemMIP/CMIP6 agrees that global OH has increased since 1980 by around 9% 
(Figure 6.9) with an associated reduction in methane lifetime (Stevenson et al., 2020). This positive OH 
trend is in agreement with the ~7% OH increase derived by assimilating global-scale satellite observations of 
CO over the 2002-2013 period (with CO declining trends) into a CCM (Gaubert et al., 2017; see section 
6.3.4). Multi-model sensitivity analysis suggests that increasing OH since 1980 is predominantly driven by 
changes in anthropogenic SLCF emissions with complementary influence of increasing NOx and decreasing 
CO emissions (Stevenson et al., 2020).  
 
Over paleo time scales, proxy-based observational constraints from CH₄ and formaldehyde suggest 
tropospheric OH to be a factor of 2 to 4 lower in the last glacial maximum (LGM) relative to preindustrial 
levels, though these estimates are highly uncertain (Alexander and Mickley, 2015). Global models, in 
contrast, exhibit no change in tropospheric OH (and consequently in methane lifetime) at the LGM relative 
to the preindustrial (Murray et al., 2014; Quiquet et al., 2015), however the sign and magnitude of OH 
changes are sensitive to model predictions of changes in natural emissions, including lightning NOx and 
BVOCs, and model representation of isoprene oxidation chemistry (Achakulwisut et al., 2015; Hopcroft et 
al., 2017).  
 
Regarding change since preindustrial era, at the time of the AR5, ensemble mean of 17 global models 
participating in ACCMIP indicated little change in tropospheric OH from 1850 to 2000. This was due to the 
competing and finally offsetting changes in factors enhancing or reducing OH with a consequent small 
decline in methane lifetime (Naik et al., 2013; Voulgarakis et al., 2013). However, there was large diversity 
in both the sign and magnitude of past OH changes across the individual models attributed to disparate 
implementation of chemical and physical processes (Nicely et al., 2017; Wild et al., 2020). Analysis of 
historical simulations from three CMIP6 ESMs indicates little change in global mean OH from 1850 to about 
1980 (Stevenson et al., 2020). However, there is no observational evidence of changes in global OH since 
1850 up to early 1980s to evaluate the ESMs.  
 
In summary, global mean tropospheric OH does not show a significant trend from 1850 up to around 1980 
(low confidence). There is conflicting information from global models constrained by emissions versus 
observationally constrained inversion methods over the 1980-2014 period. A positive trend since 1980 
(about 9 % increase over 1980-2014) is a robust feature among ESMs and CCMs and there is medium 
confidence that this trend is mainly driven by increases in global anthropogenic NOx emissions and decreases 
in CO emissions. There is limited evidence and medium agreement for positive trends or absence of trends 
inferred from observation-constrained methods. Overall, there is medium confidence that global mean OH 
has remained stable or exhibited a positive trend since the 1980s.

# 6.4  SLCF radiative forcing and climate effects 
 
The radiative forcing on the climate system introduced by SLCFs is distinguished from that of LLGHGs by 
the diversity of forcing mechanisms for SLCFs, and the challenges of constraining these mechanisms via 
observations and of inferring their global forcings from available data. Chapter 7 assesses the global 
estimates of ERFs due to SLCF abundance changes. This section assesses the characteristics (e.g., spatial 
patterns, temporal evolution) of forcings, climate response and feedbacks due to SLCFs relying primarily on 
results from CMIP6 models. Additionally, the ERFs for several aerosol-based forms of solar radiation 
modification (SRM) are discussed in Section 6.4.6.  
 
Forcing and climate response due to changes in SLCFs are typically estimated from global models that vary 
in their representation of the various chemical, physical, and radiative processes (see Box 6.1) affecting the 
causal chain from SLCF emissions to climate response (Figure 6.2). The AR5 noted that the representation 
of aerosol processes varied greatly in CMIP5 models and that it remained unclear what level of 
sophistication is required to properly quantify aerosol effects on climate (Boucher et al., 2013). Since the 
AR5, (Ekman, 2014) found that the CMIP5 models with the most complex representations of aerosol 
impacts on cloud microphysics had the largest reduction in biases in surface temperature trends. CMIP6-
generation CCMs that simulate aerosol and cloud size distributions better represent the effect of a volcanic 
eruption on lower atmosphere clouds than a model with aerosol-mass only (Malavelle et al., 2017). This 
highlights the need for skillful simulation of conditions underlying aerosol-cloud interactions, such as the 
distribution, transport and properties of aerosol species, in addition to the interactions themselves (see 
Chapter 7). In advance of CMIP6, representations of aerosol processes and aerosol-cloud interactions in 
ESMs have generally become more comprehensive (Gliß et al., 2021; Meehl et al., 2020; Thornhill et al., 
2021b; see also Section 1.5), with enhanced links to aerosol emissions and gas-phase chemistry. Many 
CMIP6 models (see Annex II Table AII.5) now simulate aerosol number size distribution, in addition to 
mass distribution, which is a prerequisite for accurately simulating number concentrations of cloud 
condensation nuclei (CCN) (Bellouin et al., 2013) while some CMIP6 models use prescribed aerosol optical 
properties to constrain aerosol forcing (e.g., Stevens et al., 2017). Hence, the range of complexity in aerosol 
modeling noted in CMIP5 is still present in the CMIP6 ensemble. Although simulated CCN have been 
compared to surface (Fanourgakis et al., 2019) and aircraft (Reddington et al., 2017) measurements, with 
mixed results, the lack of global coverage limits confidence in the evaluations. Evaluations of aerosol optical 
depths have been more wide ranging (section 6.3.5; Gliß et al., 2021) but are less relevant to aerosol-cloud 
interactions as they do not allow to evaluate vertical profiles, aerosol-cloud overlap regions, aerosol type or 
number. Nevertheless, biases in simulated patterns and trends in aerosol optical depths, alongside biases in 
cloud fractions (Vignesh et al., 2020), likely affect quantifications of the aerosol-cloud interactions.  
 
In summary, CMIP6 models generally represent more processes that drive aerosol-cloud interactions than the 
previous generation of climate models, but there is only medium confidence that those enhancements 
improve their fitness for the purpose of simulating radiative forcing of aerosol-cloud interactions because 
only a few studies have identified the level of sophistication required to do so. In addition, the challenge of 
representing the small-scale processes involved in aerosol-cloud interactions, and a lack of relevant model-
data comparisons, does not allow to quantitatively assess the progress of the models from CMIP5 to CMIP6 
in simulating the underlying conditions relevant for aerosol-cloud interactions at this time.  
 
 
## 6.4.1  Historical Estimates of Regional Short-lived Climate Forcing  
 
The highly heterogeneous distribution of SLCF abundances (section 6.3) translates to strong heterogeneity in 
the spatial pattern and temporal evolution of forcing and climate responses due to SLCFs. This section 
assesses the spatial patterns of the current forcing due to aerosols and their historical evolution by region.  
 
In AR5, the confidence in the spatial patterns of aerosol and ozone forcing was lower than that for the global 
mean because of the large spread in the regional distribution simulated by global models, and was assessed 
as ‘medium’. The AR5 assessment was based on aerosol and ozone RFs and aerosol ERFs (with fixed SSTs) 
from ACCMIP and a small sample of CMIP5 experiments (Myhre et al., 2013b; Shindell et al., 2013). For 
this assessement, the spatial distribution of aerosol ERF (ERFAER) due to human-induced changes in aerosol 
concentrations over 1850-2014 is quantified based on results from a 7 member ensemble of CMIP6 ESMs 
including interactive gas and aerosol chemistry analysed in AerChemMIP. There is insufficient information 
to estimate the spatial patterns of ozone ERF from CMIP6, however, the spatial patterns in SLCF ERF are 
dominated by that from aerosol ERF over most regions (e.g., Shindell et al., 2015). The ERFAER includes 
contributions from both direct aerosol-radiation (ERFari) and indirect aerosol-cloud interactions (ERFaci) (see 
Section 7.3.3) and is computed as the difference between radiative fluxes from simulations with 
time-evolving aerosol and their precuror emissions and identical simulations but with these emissions held at 
their 1850 levels (Collins et al., 2017). Both the simulations are driven by time-evolving SSTs and sea ice 
from the respective coupled model historical simulation and therefore differ from ERFs computed using 
fixed pre-industrial SST and sea-ice fields (Section 7.3.1), but the effect of this difference is generally small 
(Forster et al., 2016). A correction for land surface temperature change (Section 7.3.1) is not available from 
these data to explicitly quantify the contribution from adjustments. The ESMs included here used the CMIP6 
anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions for ozone and aerosol precursors but varied in their 
representation of natural emissions, chemistry and climate characteristics contributing to spread in the 
simulated concentrations (also see section 6.3) and resulting forcings, partly reflecting uncertainties in the 
successive processes (Thornhill et al., 2021b). 
 
The geographical distribution of the ensemble mean ERFAER over the 1850-2014 period is highly 
heterogeneous (Figure 6.10a) in agreement with AR5. Negative ERFAER is greatest over and downwind of 
most industrialized regions in the Northern Hemisphere and to some extent over tropical biomass burning 
regions, with robust signals. Largest negative forcing occurs over East Asia and South Asia, followed by 
Europe and North America, reflecting the changes in anthropogenic aerosol emissions in the recent decades 
(Section 6.2). Positive ERFAER over high albedo areas, including cryosphere, deserts and clouds, also found 
in AR5 and attributed to absorbing aerosols, are not robust across the small CMIP6 ensemble applied here. 
Regionally aggregated shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) components of the ERFAER  exhibit similar large 
variability across regions (Figure 6.10b). The SW flux changes come from aerosol-radiation and aerosol-
cloud interactions while the small positive LW flux changes come from aerosol-cloud interactions (related to 
liquid water path changes (Section 7.3.2.2). These spatial patterns in ERFAER are similar to the patterns 
reported in AR5.  
 
Time evolution of 20 year means of regional net ERFAER shows that the regions are divided into two groups 
depending on whether the mean ERFAER attains its negative peak value in the 1970s to 1980s (e.g., Europe, 
North America) or in the late 1990s to 2000s (e.g., Asia, South America) (Figure 6.11). Qualitatively, this 
shift in the distribution of ERFAER trends is consistent with the regional long-term trends in aerosol precursor 
emissions (Section 6.21; Figures 6.18 and 6.19) and their abundances (Section 6.3). However, at finer 
regional scales, there are regions where sulphate aerosols are still following an upward trend (e.g., South 
Asia; see Section 6.3.5) implying that the trends in ERFAER may not have shifted for these regions. The 
continental scale ERFAER trends are also in line with the satellite-observed AOD trends assessed in Section 
2.2.6. Global mean ERFAER reaches maximum negative values in the mid-1970s and its magnitude gradually 
decreases thereafter. This weakening of the negative forcing since 1990 agrees with findings by who 
attribute this to a reduction in global mean SO₂ emissions combined with an increase in global BC (Myhre et 
al., 2017). Uncertainties in model simulated aerosol ERF distribution and trends can result from intermodel 
variations in the representation of aerosol-cloud interactions and aerosol microphysical processes as also 
demonstrated by Bauer et al., (2020).   
 
In summary, the spatial and temporal distribution of the net aerosol ERF from 1850 to 2014 is highly 
heterogeneous (high confidence). Globally, there has been a shift from increase to decrease of the negative 
net aerosol ERF driven by trends in aerosol and their precursor emissions (high confidence). However, the 
timing of this shift varies by continental-scale region and has not occured for some finer regional scales.

## 6.4.2  Emission-based Radiative Forcing and effect on GSAT 
 
The ERFs attributable to emissions versus concentrations for several SLCFs including ozone and methane 
are different. A concentration change, used to assess the abundance-based ERF, results from the changes in 
emissions of multiple species and subsequent chemical reactions. The corollary is that the perturbation of a 
single emitted compound can induce subsequent chemical reactions and affect the concentrations of several 
climate forcers (chemical adjustments), this is what is accounted for in emission-based ERF. Due to non-
linear chemistry (cf. Section 6.3) and non-linear aerosol-cloud interactions (section 7.3.3.2), the ERF 
attributed to the individual species cannot be precisely defined, and can only be estimated through model 
simulations. For example, the ERF attributed to methane emissions, which includes indirect effects through 
ozone formation and oxidation capacity with feedbacks on the methane lifetime, depend non-linearly on the 
concentrations of NOx, CO and VOCs. This means that the results from the model simulations depend to 
some extent on the chosen methodology. In AR5 (based on Shindell et al., 2009; Stevenson et al., 2013) the 
attribution was done by removing the anthropogenic emissions of individual species one-by-one from a 
control simulation for present day conditions. Further, only the radiative forcings, and not the ERF (mainly 
including the effect of aerosol-cloud interactions) were attributed to the emitted compounds. 
 
Since AR5, the emission estimates have been revised and extended for CMIP6 (Hoesly et al., 2018), the 
models have been further developed, the period has been extended (1750-2019, vs 1750-2011 in AR5) and 
the experimental setup for the model simulations has changed (Collins et al., 2017) making a direct 
comparison of results difficult. Figure 6.13 shows the global and annual mean ERF attributed to emitted 
compounds over the period 1750-2019 based on AerChemMIP simulations (Thornhill et al., 2021b) where 
anthropogenic emissions or concentrations of individual species were perturbed from 1850 levels to 2014 
levels (methodology described in Supplementary Material 6.SM.1).

The ERF based on primary CO₂ emissions is slightly lower than the abundance-based estimate (section 
7.3.2.1) because the abundance-based ERF combines the effect of primary CO₂ emissions and a small 
additional secondary contribution from atmospheric oxidation of CH₄, CO, and VOCs (4%) of fossil origin, 
consistent with AR5 findings. 
 
Ozone depleting substances, such as N2O and halocarbons, cause a reduction in stratospheric ozone, which 
affects ozone and OH production in the troposphere through radiation UV changes (and thus affect methane). 
They also have indirect effects on aerosols and clouds (Karset et al., 2018) since changes in oxidants induce 
changes in the oxidation of aerosol precursors.  
 
The net ERF from N2O emissions is estimated to be 0.24 (0.13 to 0.34) W m-2, which is very close to the 
abundance-based estimate of 0.21 W m-2 (Section 7.3.2.3). The indirect contributions from N2O are 
relatively minor with negative (methane lifetime) and positive (ozone and clouds) effects nearly 
compensating each other. Emissions of halogenated compounds, including CFCs and HCFCs, were assessed 
as very likely causing a net positive ERF in the AR5. However recent studies (Morgenstern et al., 2020; 
O’Connor et al., 2021; Thornhill et al., 2021b) find strong adjustments in Southern Hemisphere aerosols and 
clouds such that the very likely range in the emission based ERF for CFC+HCFCs+HFCs now also include 
negative values.  
 
For methane emissions, in addition to their direct effect, there are indirect positive ERFs from methane 
enhancing its own lifetime, causing ozone production, enhancing stratospheric water vapor, and influencing 
aerosols and the lifetimes of HCFCs and HFCs (Myhre et al., 2013b; O’Connor et al., 2021). The ERF from 
methane emissions is considerably higher than the ERF estimate resulting from its abundance change. The 
central estimate with the very likely range is 1.21 (0.90 to 1.51) W m-2  for emission-based estimate versus 
0.54 W m-2 for abundance-based estimate (cf. section 7.3.5). The abundance-based ERF estimate for CH₄ 
results from contributions of its own emissions and the effects of several other compounds, some decreasing 
CH₄ lifetime, notably NOx, which importantly reduce the CH₄ abundance-based ERF. Emissions of CO and 
NMVOCs both indirectly contribute to a positive ERF through enhancing ozone production in the 
troposphere and increasing the methane lifetime. For CO and NMVOCs of fossil origin there is also a 0.07 
W m-2 contribution to CO₂ from their oxidation. The very likely total ERF of CO and NMVOCs emissions is 
estimated to 0.45 (0.22 to 0.67) W m-2.  
 
NOx causes a positive ERF through enhanced tropospheric ozone production and a negative ERF through 
enhanced OH concentrations that reduce the methane lifetime. There is also a small negative ERF 
contribution through formation of nitrate aerosols, although only 3 of the AerChemMIP models include 
nitrate aerosols. The best estimate of the net ERF from changes in anthropogenic NOx emissions is -0.29 (-
0.57 to 0.0) W m-2. The magnitude is somewhat greater than the AR5 estimate (-0.15 (-0.34 to + 0.02) W m-
2) but with similar level of uncertainty. The difference between AR6 and AR5 estimates is possibly due to 
the different modeling protocols (see Supplementary Material 6.SM.1). 
 
Anthropogenic emissions of SO₂ lead to formation of sulphate aerosols and a negative ERF through aerosol-
radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions. The emission-based ERFaci, which was not previously considered in 
AR5, is now included. The estimated ERF is thus considerably more negative than the AR5 estimate with a 
radiative forcing of -0.4 W m-2, despite the decline of ERF due to aerosols since 2011 (Figure 6.12, Section 
7.3.3.1.3). SO₂ emissions are estimated to contribute to a negative ERF of -0.90 (-0.24 to -1.56) W m-2, with 
-0.22 W m-2 from aerosol-radiation interactions and -0.68 W m-2 from aerosol-cloud interactions. Emissions 
of NH<sub>3</sub> lead to formation of ammonium-nitrate aerosols with an estimated ERF of -0.03 W m-2.  
 
The best estimate for the ERF due to emissions of BC is reduced from the AR5, and is now estimated to be 
0.063 (-0.28 to 0.42) W m-2 with an uncertainty also including negative values. As discussed in Section 
7.3.3.1.2, a significant portion of the positive BC forcing from aerosol-radiation interactions is offset by 
negative atmospheric adjustments due to cloud changes as well as lapse rate and atmospheric water vapor 
changes, resulting in a smaller positive net ERF for BC compared with AR5. The large range in the forcing 
estimate stems from variation in the magnitude and sign of atmospheric adjustments across models and is 
related to the differences in the model treatment of different processes affecting BC (e.g., ageing, mixing) 
and its interactions with clouds and cryosphere (Thornhill et al., 2021b and Section 7.3.3.). The emission-
based ERF for organic carbon aerosols is -0.20 (-0.03 to -0.41) W m-2, a weaker estimate compared with 
AR5 attributed to stronger absorption by OC (section 7.3.3.1.2). 
  
The emission-based contributions to GSAT change (Figure 6.12) were not assessed in AR5, but with the 
ERF from aerosol-cloud interactions attributed to the emitted compounds there is now a better foundation for 
this assessment. The contribution to emissions-based ERF at 2019 (left panel in figure 6.12) is scaled by the 
historical emissions (over the period 1750 to 2019) of each compound to reconstruct the historical time series 
of ERF. An impulse response function (see Cross-Chapter Box 7.1 and Supplementary Material 7.SM5.2) is 
then applied to obtain the contribution of SLCF emissions to the GSAT response. Due to the non-linear 
chemical and physical processes described above relating emissions to ERF, and the additional non-linear 
relations between ERF and GSAT, these emission-based estimates of GSAT responses strongly depend on 
the methodology applied to estimate ERF and GSAT (see Supplementary Material 6.SM.2). Therefore, the 
relative contribution of each compound through its primary emissions versus secondary formation or 
destruction (e.g. for methane emissions its ozone versus methane contributions), by construction (omitting 
the non-linear processes), will be equal for ERF and GSAT. Uncertainties in the GSAT response are 
estimated using the assessed range of the ECS from Chapter 7 of this report.  For most of the SLCFs the 
uncertainty in the GSAT response is dominated by the uncertainty in the relationship between emissions and 
the ERF. 
 
The contributions from the emitted compounds to GSAT broadly follow their contributions to the ERF, 
mainly because their evolution over the past decades have been relatively similar and slow enough compared 
to their lifetimes to be reflected similarly in their ERF and GSAT despite the delay of the GSAT response to 
ERF changes (see Section 6.6.1). However, for some SLCFs, e.g. SO₂, that have been reduced globally, their 
contribution to GSAT change is slightly higher compared with that of CO₂ than their relative contribution to 
ERF because the peak in their ERF change has already occurred (see Section 6.4.1) whereas the peak of their 
GSAT effect started to decline recently (see also Figure 7.9). This is due to the inertia of the climate system 
delaying the full response of GSAT to a change in forcing (Figure 6.15).  
 
In summary, emissions of SLCFs, especially CH₄, NOx and SO₂, have substantial effects on effective 
radiative forcing (ERF) (high confidence). The net global emissions-based ERF of NOx is negative and that 
of NMVOCs is positive, in agreement with the AR5 assessment (high confidence). For methane, the 
emission-based ERF is twice as high as the abundance-based ERF (high confidence). SO₂ emissions make 
the dominant contribution to the ERF associated with the aerosol–cloud interaction (high confidence).  
The contributions from the emitted compounds to GSAT broadly follow their contributions to the ERF (high 
confidence). However, due to the inertia of the climate system delaying the full GSAT response to a change 
in forcing, the contribution to GSAT change due to SO₂ emission is slightly higher compared with that due to 
CO₂ emissions (than their relative contributions to ERF) because the peak in emission-induced SO₂ ERF has 
already occurred. 
 
 
## 6.4.3  Climate responses to SLCFs 
 
This section briefly discusses the climate response to SLCFs, in particular to changes in aerosols, and gathers 
complementary information and assessments from Chapters 3, 7, 8, and 10.  
 
Warming or cooling atmospheric aerosols, such as BC and sulphate, can affect temperature and precipitation 
in distinct ways by modifying the shortwave and longwave radiation, the lapse rate of the troposphere, and 
influencing cloud microphysical properties (see Box 8.1 and Section 10.1.4.1.4). An important distinction 
between scattering and absorbing aerosols is the opposing nature of their influences on circulation, clouds, 
and precipitation, besides surface temperature as evident from the contrasting regional climate responses to 
regional aerosol emissions (e.g., Lewinschal et al., 2019; Sand et al., 2020; also see Chapters 8 and 10).  
 
On the global scale, as assessed in Chapter 3, anthropogenic aerosols have likely cooled GSAT since 1850–
1900 driven by the negative aerosol forcing, while it is extremely likely that human-induced stratospheric 
ozone depletion has primarily driven stratospheric between 1979 and the mid-1990s. Multiple modelling 
studies support the understanding that present-day emissions of SO₂, precursor for sulphate aerosols, are the 
dominant driver of near-surface air temperature in comparison to BC or OC even though, for some regions, 
BC forcing plays a key role (Baker et al., 2015; Samset et al., 2016; Stjern et al., 2017; Zanis et al., 2020). 
Further, there is high confidence that the aerosol-driven cooling has led to detectable large-scale water cycle 
changes since at least the mid-20th century as assessed in Chapter 8. The overall effect of surface cooling 
from anthropogenic aerosols is to reduce global precipitation and alter large-scale atmospheric circulation 
patterns (high confidence), primarily driven by the cooling effects of sulphate aerosols (Section 8.2.1). In 
addition, there is high confidence that darkening of snow through the deposition of black carbon and other 
light absorbing particles enhances snow melt (SROCC Chapter 3, see also Section 7.3.4.3). 
 
In AR5, there was low confidence in the overall understanding of climate response to spatially varying 
patterns of forcing, though there was medium to high confidence in some regional climate responses, such as 
the damped warming of the NH and shifting of the ITCZ from aerosols, and positive feedbacks enhancing 
the local response from high-latitude snow and ice albedo changes. Since AR5, the relationship between 
inhomogeneous forcing and climate response is better understood providing further evidence of the climate 
influence of SLCFs (aerosols and ozone in particular) on global to regional scales (Collins et al., 2013; 
Shindell et al., 2015; Aamaas et al., 2017; Kasoar et al., 2018; Persad and Caldeira, 2018; Wilcox et al., 
2019) which differ from the relatively homogeneous spatial influence from LLGHGs.   
 
Large geographical variations in aerosol ERFs (section 6.4.1) affect global and regional temperature 
responses (Shindell et al., 2015, Myhre et al., 2013a). A multimodel CMIP6 ensemble mean results (Figure 
6.13) show cooling over almost all areas of the globe in response to increases of aerosol and their precursor 
emissions from 1850 to recent past (1995–2014). While the ERF has hotspots, the temperature response is 
more evenly distributed in line with the results of CMIP5 models including the temperature response to 
ozone changes (Shindell et al 2015). The ensemble mean global mean surface temperature decreases by 
0.66±0.51 °C while decreasing by 0.97±0.54 °C for Northern Hemisphere and 0.34±0.2 °C for Southern 
Hemisphere. The zonal mean temperature response is negative at all latitudes (high confidence) and becomes 
more negative with increasing latitude, with a maximum ensemble mean decrease of around 2.7 °C at 
Northern polar latitudes. The zonal mean response is not directly proportional to the zonal mean forcing, 
especially in the Arctic where the temperature response is cooling while the local ERF is positive (6.10). 
This is consistent with prior studies showing that the Arctic, in particular, is highly sensitive to forcing at NH 
midlatitudes (e.g., Sand et al., 2013b; Shindell and Faluvegi, 2009) and with results from CMIP5 models 
(Shindell et al., 2015) (more on Arctic below). Thus, there is high confidence that the temperature response 
to aerosols is more asymmetric than the response to WMGHGs and negative at all latitudes. 
 
The asymmetric aerosol and greenhouse gas forcing on regional scale climate responses have also been 
assessed to lead to contrasting effects on precipitation in Chapter 8. The asymmetric historical radiative 
forcing due to aerosols led to a southward shift in the tropical rain belt (high confidence) and contributed to 
the Sahel drought from the 1970s to the 1980s (high confidence). Furthermore, the asymmetry of the forcing 
led to contrasting effects in monsoon precipitation changes over West Africa, South Asia and East Asia over 
much of the mid-20th century due to GHG-induced precipitation increases counteracted by anthropogenic 
aerosol-induced decreases (high confidence) (see Section 8.3, Box 8.1).  
 
The Arctic region is warming considerably faster than the rest of the globe (Atlas 5.9.2.2) and, generally, 
studies indicate that this amplification of the temperature response toward the Arctic has important 
contribution from local and remote aerosol forcing (Stjern et al., 2017; Westervelt et al., 2018). Several 
studies indicate that changes in long-range transport of sulphate and BC from northern midlatitudes can 
potentially explain a significant fraction of Arctic warming since 1980s (e.g., Breider et al., 2017; Navarro et 
al., 2016; Ren et al., 2020). Modeling studies show that changes in midlatitude aerosols have influenced 
Arctic climate by changing the radiative balance through aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions and 
enhancing poleward heat transport (Navarro et al., 2016; Ren et al., 2020b). Idealized aerosol perturbation 
studies have shed further light on the sensitivity of Arctic temperature response to individual aerosol species. 
Studies show relatively large responses in the Arctic to BC perturbations and reveal the importance of 
remote BC forcing by rapid adjustments (Sand et al., 2013a; Stjern et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018; Yang et al., 
2019a). Perturbations in SO₂ emissions over major emitting regions in the Northern Hemisphere have been 
shown to produce largest Arctic temperature responses (Kasoar et al., 2018; Lewinschal et al., 2019).  
 
The effects of changes in aerosols on local and remote changes in temperature, circulation and precipitation 
are sensitive to a number of model uncertainties affecting aerosol sources, transformation, and resulting 
climate effects. Therefore, regional climate effects in global model studies must be interpreted with caution. 
When investigating the climate response to regional aerosol emissions, such uncertainties are likely to be 
confounded even further by the variability between models in regional climate and circulation patterns, 
leading to greater intermodel spread at regional scales than at a global scale (Baker et al., 2015; Kasoar et al., 
2016).  
 
In summary, over the historical period, changes in aerosols and their ERF have primarily contributed to cool 
the surface temperature partly masking the human-induced warming (high confidence). Radiative forcings 
induced by aerosol changes lead to both local and remote changes in temperature (high confidence).  The 
temperature response preserves hemispheric asymmetry of the ERF but is more latitudinally uniform with 
strong amplification of the temperature response towards the Arctic (medium confidence).

# 6.4.4 Indirect radiative forcing through effects of SLCFs on the carbon cycle  

Deposition of reactive nitrogen (Nr) (i.e. NH<sub>3</sub> and NOx) increases the plant productivity and carbon 
sequestration in N-limited forests and grasslands, and also in open and coastal waters and open ocean. Such 
inadvertent fertilization of the biosphere can lead to eutrophication and reduction in biodiversity in terrestrial 
and aquatic ecosystems. AR5 assessed that it is likely that Nr deposition over land currently increases natural 
CO₂ sinks, in particular in forests, but the magnitude of this effect varies between regions (Ciais et al., 2013). 
Increasing Nr deposition or the synergy between increasing Nr deposition and atmospheric CO₂ 
concentration could have contributed to the increasing global net land CO₂ sink [Section 5.2.1.4.1].  
 
Ozone uptake itself damages photosynthesis and reduces plant growth with consequences for the carbon and 
water cycles (Ainsworth et al., 2012; Emberson et al., 2018). AR5 concluded there was robust evidence of 
the effect of ozone on plant physiology and subsequent alteration of the carbon storage but considered 
insufficient quantification of and a lack of systematic incorporation of the ozone effect in carbon-cycle 
models as a limitation to assess the terrestrial carbon balance (Ciais et al., 2013).  Since AR5 several more 
ESMs have incorporated interactive ozone-vegetation damage resulting in an increase in evidence to support 
the influence of ozone on the land carbon cycle. The new modelling studies tend to focus on ozone effects on 
plant productivity rather than the land carbon storage and agree that ozone-induced gross-primary 
productivity (GPP) losses are largest today in eastern USA, Europe and eastern China ranging from 5-20% 
on the regional scale (Yue and Unger, 2014; Lombardozzi et al., 2015; Yue et al., 2017; Oliver et al., 2018) 
(low confidence). There is medium evidence and high agreement based on observational studies and models 
that ozone-vegetation interactions further influence the climate system, including water and carbon cycles by 
affecting stomatal control over plant transpiration of water vapour between the leaf surface and atmosphere 
(Arnold et al., 2018; Hoshika et al., 2015; Lombardozzi et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2012; VanLoocke et al., 
2012; Wittig et al., 2007). While some modelling studies suggest that the unintended Nr deposition 
fertilization effect in forests may potentially offset the ozone-induced carbon losses (Felzer et al., 2007; de 
Vries et al., 2017), complex interactions have been observed between ozone and Nr deposition to ecosystems 
that have not yet been included in ESMs. For some plants, the effects of increasing ozone on root biomass 
become more pronounced as Nr deposition increased, and the beneficial effects of Nr on root development 
were lost at higher ozone treatments (Mills et al., 2016). Reducing uncertainties in ozone vegetation damage 
effects on the carbon cycle requires improved information on the sensitivity of different plant species to 
ozone, and measurements of ozone dose-response relationships for tropical plants, which are currently 
lacking. Surface ozone effect on the land carbon sink and indirect CO₂ forcing, therefore, remains uncertain. 
Collins et al. (2010) showed that adding in the effects of surface ozone on vegetation damage and reduced 
uptake of CO₂ added about 10 % to the methane emission metrics and could change the sign of the NOx 
metrics. However, this estimate has to be considered as an upper limit due to limitation of the 
paramaterization used by Sitch et al. (2007) considering more recent knowledge and is thus not included in 
the current metrics (Section 7.6.1.3). 
 
Tropospheric aerosols influence the land and ocean ecosystem productivity and the carbon cycle through 
changing physical climate and meteorology (Jones, 2003; Cox et al., 2008; Mahowald, 2011; Unger et al., 
2017) and through changing deposition of nutrients including nitrogen, sulphur, iron and phosphorous 
(Mahowald et al., 2017; Kanakidou et al., 2018). There is high evidence and high agreement from field 
(Oliveira et al., 2007; Cirino et al., 2014; Rap et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2018c) and modelling (Mercado et 
al., 2009; Strada and Unger, 2016; Lu et al., 2017; Yue et al., 2017) studies that aerosols affect plant 
productivity through increasing the diffuse fraction of downward shortwave radiation although the 
magnitude and importance to the global land carbon sink is controversial. At large-scales the dominant effect 
of aerosols on the carbon cycle is likely a global cooling effect of the climate (Jones, 2003; Mahowald, 2011; 
Unger et al., 2017) (medium confidence). We assess that these interactions between aerosols and the carbon 
cycle are currently too uncertain to constrain quantitatively the indirect CO₂ forcing. 
 
In summary, reactive nitrogen, ozone and aerosols affect terrestrial vegetation and carbon cycle through 
deposition and effects on large scale radiation (high confidence) but the magnitude of these effects on the 
land carbon sink, ecosystem productivity and indirect CO₂ forcing remain uncertain due to the difficulty in 
disentangling the complex interactions between the effects. As such we assess it to be of second order in 
comparison to the direct CO₂ forcing (high confidence) but, at least for ozone, it could add a substantial 
(positive) forcing compared with its direct forcing (low confidence).  
 
 
## 6.4.5  Non-CO₂ biogeochemical feedbacks  
 
Climate change-induced changes in atmospheric composition and forcing due to perturbations in natural 
processes constitute an Earth system feedback amplifying (positive feedback) or diminishing (negative 
feedback) the initial climate perturbation (Ciais et al., 2013; Heinze et al., 2019). Quantification of these 
biogeochemical feedbacks is important to allow for better estimate of the expected effects of emission 
reduction policies for mitigating climate change and the effect on the allowable global carbon budget (Lowe 
and Bernie, 2018). Biogeochemical feedbacks due to changes in carbon-cycle are assessed in Section 5.4.5, 
while physical and biophysical climate feedbacks are assessed in Section 7.4.2. Additionally, non-CO₂ 
biogeochemical feedbacks due to climate driven changes in methane sources and N2O sources and sinks are 
assessed in Section 5.4.7. The goal of this section is to estimate the feedback parameter (α as defined in 
section 7.4.1.1) from climate-induced changes in atmospheric abundances or lifetimes of SLCFs mediated by 
natural processes or atmospheric chemistry. These non-CO₂ biogeochemical feedbacks act on time scales of 
years to decades and have important implications for climate sensitivity and emission abatement policies. 
The feedback parameter is quantified entirely from ESMs that expand the complexity of CCMs by coupling 
the physical climate and atmospheric chemistry to land and ocean biogeochemistry. In AR5, α for non-CO₂ 
biogeochemical feedbacks was estimated from an extremely limited set of modeling studies with much less 
confidence associated with the estimate. Since AR5, ESMs have advanced to include more feedback 
processes facilitating a relatively more robust assessment of α. CMIP6 ESMs participating in AerChemMIP 
performed coordinated sets of experiments (Collins et al., 2017) facilitating the consistent estimation of α 
(Thornhill et al., 2021a) and we rely on this multi-model analysis for the best estimates (Table 6.9). 
Considering the consistent methodology, the assessed central values and 5-95% ranges for α are based on the 
AerChemMIP estimates. The full range of model uncertainty is not captured in AerChemMIP because of the 
relatively small ensemble size therefore estimates from studies using other models or with different protocols 
are discussed to reinforce or critique these values.  
 
Climate-Sea-spray feedback: Sea-spray emissions from ocean surfaces influence climate directly or 
indirectly through the formation of CCN as discused in Section 6.2.1.2. They are sensitive to sea-surface 
temperature, sea ice extent, as well as wind speed and are therefore expected to feedback on climate 
(Struthers et al., 2013). However, there are large uncertainties in the strength of climate feedback from sea-
spray aerosols because of the diversity in the model representation of emissions (many represent sea-salt 
emissions only) and their functional dependence on environmental factors noted above, in situ atmospheric 
chemical and physical processes affecting the sea-spray lifetime, and aerosol-cloud interactions (Struthers et 
al., 2013; Soares et al., 2016; Nazarenko et al., 2017). Additional work is needed to identify how sea-spray 
and POA emissions respond to shifts in ocean biology and chemistry in response to warming, ocean 
acidification, and changes in circulation patterns (Burrows et al., 2018) and affect CCN and INP formation 
(DeMott et al., 2016). AerChemMIP models, representing only the sea-salt emissions, agree that the 
sea-salt-climate feedback is negative, however there is a large range in the feedback parameter indicating 
large uncertainties (Table 6.9). 
 
Climate-DMS feedback: Dimethyl sulphide (DMS) is produced by marine phytoplankton and is emitted to 
the atmosphere where it can lead to the subsequent formation of sulphate aerosol and CCN (see Section 
6.2.1.2). Changes in DMS emissions from ocean could feedback on climate through their response to 
changes in temperature, solar radiation, ocean mixed-layer depth, sea-ice extent, wind-speed, nutrient 
recycling or shifts in marine ecosystems due to ocean acidification and climate change, or atmospheric 
processing of DMS into CCN (Heinze et al., 2019). Models with varying degrees of representation of the 
relevant biogeochemical processes and effects on DMS fluxes produce diverging estimates of changes in 
DMS emission strength under climate change resulting in large uncertainties in the DMS–sulphate–cloud 
albedo feedback  (Bopp et al., 2004; Kloster et al., 2007; Gabric et al., 2013). In AR5, the climate-DMS 
feedback parameter was estimated to be -0.02 W m–2 °C–1 based on a single model. Since AR5, new 
modeling studies using empirical relationships between pH and total DMS production find that global DMS 
emissions decrease due to combined ocean acidification and climate change leading to a strong positive 
climate feedback (Six et al., 2013; Schwinger et al., 2017). However, another study argues for a much 
weaker positive feedback globally due to complex and compensating regional changes in marine ecosystems 
(Wang et al., 2018b). The AerChemMIP multimodel analysis suggests small positive feedback (Table 6.9), 
consistent with these recent studies, but with large uncertainties in the magnitude of α.  
 
Climate-dust feedback: Mineral dust is the most abundant aerosol type in the atmosphere, when considering 
aerosol mass, and affects the climate system by interacting with both longwave and shortwave radiation as 
well as contributing to the formation of CCN and INP. Because dust emissions are sensitive to climate 
variability (e.g., through changes in the extent of arid land) (Section 6.2.1.2), it has been hypothesized that 
the climate-dust feedback could be an important feedback loop in the climate system. Since AR5, an 
improved understanding of the shortwave absorption properties of dust as well as a consensus that dust 
particles are larger than previously thought has led to a revised understanding that the magnitude of radiative 
forcing due to mineral dust is small (Kok et al., 2017; Ryder et al., 2018). A recent study notes that global 
models underestimate the amount of coarse dust in the atmosphere and accounting for this limitation raises 
the possibility that dust emissions warm the climate system (Adebiyi and Kok, 2020).  Model predictions of 
dust emissions in response to future climate change range from an increase (Woodward et al., 2005) to a 
decrease  (Mahowald and Luo, 2003), thus leading to high uncertainties on the sign of the climate-dust 
feedback. Since the AR5, Kok et al. (2018) estimated the direct dust-climate feedback parameter, from 
changes in the dust direct radiative effect only, to be in the range –0.04 to +0.02 W m–2 °C–1. The assessed 
central value and the 5-95%range of climate-dust feedback parameter based on AerChemMIP ensemble 
(Table 6.9) is within the range of the published estimate, however both the magnitude and sign of α are 
model-dependent.  
 
Climate-ozone feedback: Changes in ozone concentrations in response to projected climate change have 
been shown to lead to a potential climate-atmospheric chemistry feedback. Chemistry-climate models 
consistently project a decrease in lower tropical stratospheric ozone levels due to enhanced upwelling of 
ozone poor tropospheric air associated with surface warming driven strengthening of the Brewer-Dobson 
circulation (Bunzel and Schmidt, 2013). Further, models project an increase in middle and extratropical 
stratospheric ozone due to increased downwelling through the strengthened Brewer-Dobson circulation 
(Bekki et al., 2013; Dietmüller et al., 2014). These stratospheric ozone changes induce a net negative global 
mean ozone radiative feedback (Dietmüller et al., 2014). Tropospheric ozone shows a range of responses to 
climate with models generally agreeing that warmer climate will lead to decreases in the tropical lower 
troposphere owing to increased water vapour and increases in the sub-tropical to mid-latitude upper 
troposphere due to increases in lightning and stratosphere-to-troposphere transport (Stevenson et al., 2013). 
A small positive feedback is estimated from climate-induced changes in global mean tropospheric ozone 
(Dietmüller et al., 2014) while a small negative feedback is estimated by (Heinze et al., 2019) based on the 
model results of (Stevenson et al., 2013). Additionally, these ozone feedbacks induce a change in 
stratospheric water vapor amplifying the feedback due to stratospheric ozone (Stuber et al., 2001). Since 
AR5, several modeling studies have estimated the intensity of meteorology driven ozone feedbacks on 
climate from either combined tropospheric and stratospheric ozone changes or separately with contrasting 
results.  One study suggests no change (Marsh et al., 2016), while other studies report reductions of 
equilibrium climate sensitivity ranging from 7-8% (Dietmüller et al., 2014; Muthers et al., 2014) to 20% 
(Nowack et al., 2015). The estimate of this climate-ozone feedback parameter is very strongly model 
dependent with values ranging from -0.13 to -0.01 W m–2 °C–1 though there is agreement that it is negative.  
The assessed central value and the 5-95% range of climate-ozone feedback parameter based on 
AerChemMIP ensemble is within the range of these published estimates but closer to the lower bound. This 
climate-ozone feedback factor does not include the feedback on ozone from lightning changes which is 
discussed separately below.  
 
Climate-BVOC feedback:  BVOCs, such as isoprene and terpenes, are produced by land vegetation and 
marine plankton (Section 6.2.1.2). Once in the atmosphere, BVOCs and their oxidation products lead to the 
formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) exerting a negative forcing, and increased ozone 
concentrations and methane lifetime exerting a positive forcing. BVOC emissions are suggested to lead to a 
climate feedback in part because of their strong temperature dependence observed under present-day 
conditions (Kulmala et al., 2004; Arneth et al., 2010a). Their response to future changes in climate and CO₂ 
levels remains uncertain (see Section 6.2.2.3. Estimates of the climate-BVOC feedback parameter are 
typically based on global models which vary in their level of complexity of emissions parameterization, 
BVOC speciation, the mechanism of SOA formation and the interaction with ozone chemistry (Thornhill et 
al., 2021a). Since AR5, observational studies (Paasonen et al. 2013) and models (Scott et al. 2018) estimate 
the feedback due to biogenic SOA (via changes in BVOC emissions) to be in the range of about –0.06 
to -0.01 W m–2 °C–1. The assessed central estimate of the climate-BVOC feedback parameter based on the 
AerChemMIP ensemble suggests that climate-induced increases in SOA from BVOCs will lead to a strong 
cooling effect that will outweigh the warming from increased ozone and methane lifetime, however the 
uncertainty is large (Thornhill et al., 2021a).  
 
Climate-Lightning NOx feedback: As discussed in Section 6.2.1.2, climate change influences lightning NOx 
emissions. Increases in lightning NOx emissions will not only increase tropospheric ozone and decrease 
methane lifetime but also increase the formation of sulphate and nitrate aerosols, via oxidant changes, 
offsetting the positive forcing from ozone. The response of lightning NOx to climate change remains 
uncertain and is highly dependent on the parameterization of lightning in ESMs (Finney et al., 2016b; Clark 
et al., 2017) (also see section 6.2.1.2). AerChemMIP multi-model ensemble mean estimate a net negative 
climate feedback from increases in lightning NOx in a warming world (Thornhill et al., 2021a). All 
AerChemMIP models use a cloud-top height lightning parameterization that predicts increases in lightning 
with warming. However, a positive climate-lightning NOx feedback cannot be ruled out because of the 
dependence of the response to lightning parameterizations as discussed in section 6.2.2.1.  
 
Climate-CH₄ Lifetime feedback: Warmer and wetter climate will lead to increases in OH and oxidation rates 
leading to reduced atmospheric methane lifetime – a negative feedback (Naik et al., 2013; Voulgarakis et al., 
2013). Furthermore, since OH is in turn removed by methane, the climate-methane lifetime feedback will be 
amplified (Prather, 1996) (also see section 6.3.1). Based on the multimodel results of Voulgarakis et al. 
(2013), α for climate-methane lifetime is estimated to be -0.030 ± 0.01 W m−2 °C−1 by Heinze et al., (2019). 
The assessed central value of α based on the AerChemMIP ensemble is within the range of this estimate but 
with greater uncertainty (Thornhill et al., 2021a).  
 
Climate-Fire feedback: Wildfires are a major source of SLCF emissions (section 6.2.2.6). Climate change 
has the potential to enhance fire activity (see Sections 5.4.3.2, Chapter 12.4) thereby enhancing SLCF 
emissions leading to feedbacks. Climate driven increases in fire could potentially lead to offsetting feedback 
from increased ozone and decreased methane lifetime (due to increases in OH) leaving the feedback from 
aerosols to dominate with an uncertain net effect (e.g., Landry et al., 2015). AR5 assessment of climate-fire 
feedbacks included a value of α due to fire aerosols to be in the range of -0.03 to + 0.06 W m−2 °C−1 based on 
Arneth et al. (2010). A recent study estimates climate feedback due to fire aerosols to be greater than that 
due to BVOCs, with a value of α equal to -0.15 (-0.24 to -0.05) W m−2 °C−1 (Scott et al., 2018). Clearly, the 
assessment of fire related non-CO₂ biogeochemical feedbacks is very uncertain because of limitations in the 
process understanding of the interactions between climate, vegetation and fire dynamics, and atmospheric 
chemistry and their representation in the current generation ESMs. Some AerChemMIP ESMs include the 
representation of fire dynamics but do not activate their interaction with atmospheric chemistry. Given the 
large uncertainty and lack of information from AerChemMIP ESMs, we do not include a quantitative 
assessment of climate-fire feedback for AR6.   
 
In summary, climate-driven changes in emissions, atmospheric abundances or lifetimes of SLCFs are 
assessed to have an overall cooling effect, i.e., a negative feedback parameter of -0.20 W m−2 °C−1 with a 5-
95% range of -0.41 to + 0.01 W m−2 °C−1, thereby reducing climate sensitivity (see Section 7.4.2.5.1). This 
net feedback parameter is obtained by summing the assessed estimates for the individual feedback given in 
Table 6.8. Confidence in the magnitude and the sign of most of the individual as well as the total non-CO₂ 
biogeochemical feedbacks remains low as evident from the large range in the value of α. This large 
uncertainty is attributed to the diversity in model representation of the relevant chemical and biogeochemical 
processes based on limited process-level understanding.

## 6.4.6  ERF by aerosols in proposed Solar Radiation Modification   
 
Solar radiation modification (SRM, see also Sections  4.6.3.3, 8.6.3) have the potential to exert a significant 
ERF on the climate, mainly by affecting the SW component of the radiation budget (e.g. Caldeira et al., 
2013; Lawrence et al., 2018; National Academy of Sciences, 2015). The possible ways and the extent to 
which the most commonly discussed options may affect radiative forcing is addressed in this section. Side-
effects of SRM on stratospheric ozone and changes in atmospheric transport due to radiative heating of the 
lower stratosphere are discussed in Section 4.6.3.3.  
 
Stratospheric aerosol injections have the potential to achieve a high negative global ERF, with maximum 
ERFs ranging from -2 to -5 W m-2 (Niemeier and Timmreck, 2015; Weisenstein et al., 2015; Niemeier and 
Schmidt, 2017; Kleinschmitt et al., 2018). The magnitude of the maximum achievable ERF depends on the 
chosen aerosol type and mixture, internal structure and size, or precursor gas (e.g. SO₂), as well as the 
injection strategy; latitude, altitude, magnitude, and season of injections, plume dispersal, model 
representation of aerosol microphysics, and ambient aerosol concentrations (Rasch et al., 2008; Robock et 
al., 2008; Pierce et al., 2010; Weisenstein et al., 2015; Laakso et al., 2017; Macmartin et al., 2017; Dai et al., 
2018; Kleinschmitt et al., 2018; Vattioni et al., 2019; Visioni et al., 2019). For sulphur, the radiative forcing 
efficiency is of around -0.1 to -0.4 W m-2 / (TgS yr-1) (Niemeier and Timmreck, 2015; Weisenstein et al., 
2015; Niemeier and Schmidt, 2017). Different manufactured aerosols, such as ZrO2, TiO2, and Al2O3, have 
different ERF efficiencies compared to sulphate (Ferraro et al., 2011; Weisenstein et al., 2015; Dykema et 
al., 2016; Jones et al., 2016). The aerosol size distribution influences the optical properties of an aerosol 
layer, and hence the ERF efficiency, which also depends on the dispersion, transport, and residence time of 
the aerosols.  
 
For marine cloud brightening (MCB), seeded aerosols may affect both cloud microphysical and 
macrophysical properties (see also Section 7.3.3.2). By principle, MCB relies on ERFaci through the so-called 
Twomey effect (Twomey, 1977), but ERFari may be of equal magnitude as shown in studies that consider 
spraying of sea salt outside tropical marine cloud areas (Jones and Haywood, 2012; Partanen et al., 2012; 
Alterskjær and Kristjánsson, 2013; Ahlm et al., 2017). The maximum negative ERF estimated from 
modelling is within the range of -0.8 to -5.4 W m-2  (Latham et al., 2008; Rasch et al., 2009; Jones et al., 
2011; Partanen et al., 2012; Alterskjær and Kristjánsson, 2013). For dry sea salt, the ERF efficiency is 
estimated to be within the range of  -3 to -10 W m-2 / (Pg yr-1), when emitted over tropical oceans in ESMs in 
the Geoengineering Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP) (Ahlm et al., 2017). Cloud resolving models reveal 
complex behaviour and response of stratocumulus clouds to seeding, in that the ERF efficiency depends on 
meteorological conditions, and the ambient aerosol composition, where lower background particle 
concentrations may increase the ERFaci efficiency (Wang et al., 2011). Seeding could suppress precipitation 
formation and drizzle, and hence increase the lifetime of clouds, preserving their cooling effect (Ferek et al., 
2000). In contrast, cloud lifetime could be decreased by making the smaller droplets more susceptible to 
evaporation. Modelling studies have shown that a positive ERFaci (warming) could also result from seeding 
clouds with too large aerosols (Pringle et al., 2012; Alterskjær and Kristjánsson, 2013). These processes, and 
the combination of these, are not well understood, and may have a limited representation in models, or 
counteracting errors (Mülmenstädt and Feingold, 2018), lending low to medium confidence to the ERF 
estimates. 
 
Modelled ERFaci associated with cirrus cloud thinning (CCT) cover a wide range in the literature, and the 
maximum are of the order of -0.8 to -3.5 W m-2, though they are of low confidence, with some studies using 
more simplified representations (Mitchell and Finnegan, 2009; Storelvmo et al., 2013; Kristjánsson et al., 
2015; Jackson et al., 2016; Muri et al., 2018; Gasparini et al., 2020). ERFaci for CCT is mainly affected by 
particle seeding concentrations, with an optimum around 20 L-1, according to limited evidence from models 
(Storelvmo et al., 2013). Seeding leading to higher particle concentrations could lead to a warming 
(Storelvmo et al., 2013; Penner et al., 2015; Gasparini and Lohmann, 2016). The lack of representation of 
processes related to, for example, heterogeneous and homogeneous freezing and their prevalence, is a 
dominant source of uncertainty in ERF estimates, in addition to less research activity.   
 
In summary, the aerosol and cloud microphysics involved with SRM are not well understood, with a varying 
degree of lack of representation of relevant processes in models. ERF of up to several W m-2 is reported in 
the literature, with SAI at the higher end and CCT with lower potentials, though it remains a challenge to 
establish ERF potentials and efficacies with confidence. Modelling studies have been published with more 
sophisticated treatment of SRM since AR5, but the uncertainties, such as cloud-aerosol radiation 
interactions, remain large (high confidence). 


# 6.5 Implications of changing climate on AQ 
 
Air pollutants can be impacted by climate change through physical changes affecting meterorological 
conditions, chemical changes affecting their lifetimes, and biological changes affecting their natural 
emissions (Kirtman et al., 2013). Changes in meteorology affect air quality directly through modifications of 
atmospheric transport patterns (e.g., occurrence and length of atmospheric blocking episodes, ventilation of 
the polluted boundary layer), extent of mixing layer and stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) for 
surface ozone (Von Schneidemesser et al., 2015), and through modifications of the rate of reactions that 
generate secondary species in the atmosphere. Changing precipitation patterns in a future climate also 
influence the wet removal efficiency, in particular for atmospheric aerosols (Hou et al., 2018). Processes at 
play in non-CO₂ biogeochemical feedbacks (Section 6.4.5) are also involved in the perturbation of 
atmospheric pollutants (see Section 6.2.2). 
 
This section relies on observational studies performed by analysing correlation between specific 
meteorological conditions projected to occur more frequently in the future and surface pollutants, and global 
and regional scale modelling studies considering solely climate change in the future. We also assess the 
surface ozone and PM2.5 changes based on CMIP6 models analysed in AerChemMIP, considering climate 
change in isolation with emissions in 2050 from SSP3-7.0 scenario (see Section 6.7.1). Air quality being 
highly variable in space and time, the use of regional atmospheric chemistry models is necessary to 
characterise the effect of future climate on air quality properly. However, difficulties for such assessment 
arise from the need for long simulations that include complex chemistry-natural system interactions with 
high computational cost, in addition to the difficulty related to the regionalisation of climate change (see 
Section 10.3.1.2). Changes in the occurrence of weather patterns influencing air pollution (e.g., anticyclonic 
stagnation conditions, transport pathways from pollution sources, convection) due to climate change are 
assessed in Chapters 4 and 11.   
 
 
## 6.5.1  Effect of climate change on surface O3 
 
AR5 assessed with high confidence that (Kirtman et al., 2013), in unpolluted regions, higher water vapour 
abundances and temperatures in a warmer climate would enhance ozone chemical destruction, leading to 
lower baseline5 surface ozone levels. In polluted regions, AR5 assessed with medium confidence that higher 
surface temperatures will trigger regional feedbacks in chemistry and local emissions that will increase 
surface ozone and intensity of surface O3 peaks.  
 
The response of surface ozone to climate induced Earth system changes is complex due to counteracting 
effects. Studies considering the individual effects of climate driven changes in specific precursor emissions 
or processes show increases in surface ozone under warmer atmosphere for some processes. This is indeed 
the case for enhanced STE and stratospheric ozone recovery (Sekiya and Sudo, 2014; Banerjee et al., 2015; 
Hess et al., 2015; Meul et al., 2018; Morgenstern et al., 2018; Akritidis et al., 2019) or the increase of soil 
NOx emissions (Wu et al., 2008; Romer et al., 2018), which can each lead to 1 to 2 ppb increase in surface 
ozone. Other processes, in particular deposition or those related to emissions from natural systems (see 
section 6.2.2) are expected to play a key role in future surface ozone and even occurrence of pollution events 
(e.g. in the case of wildfires) but their effects are difficult to quantify in isolation. 
 
Since the AR5, several studies have investigated the net effect of climate change on surface ozone, based on 
either global or regional model projections. A systematic and quantitative comparison of the ozone change, 
however, is difficult due to the variety of models with different complexities in the representation of natural 
emissions, chemical mechanisms, and physical processes as well as the surface O3 metrics applied for 
analysis. Processes like temperature-, CO₂-sensitive BVOC emissions, deposition, and branching ratio in 
isoprene nitrates chemistry have been shown to be particularly sensitive (Squire et al., 2015; Val Martin et 
al., 2015; Schnell et al., 2016; Pommier et al., 2018). More robust protocol are now used more commonly 
comprising, notably, longer simulations necessary to separate change from interannual variability 
(Lacressonnière et al., 2016; Garcia-Menendez et al., 2017) (Barnes et al., 2016). However, the amplitude of 
climate change penalty on ozone over polluted regions may be different in high-resolution (regional and 
urban-scale) models in comparison to coarse resolution global models as a number of controlling processes 
are resolution-dependent including e.g local emissions, sensitivity to the chemical regime (VOC limited 
versus NOx limited) (Lauwaet et al., 2014; Markakis et al., 2014, 2016). 
 
Consistent with AR5 findings, global surface ozone concentration decreases by up to -1.2 to 2.3 ppb for 
annual mean due to the dominating role of ozone destruction by water vapor are found in four member 
ensemble of CMIP6 ESM for surface warmings of 1.5 to 2.5 °C (Figure 6.14). This decrease is driven by the 
ozone decrease over oceans, especially in the tropics (decrease of 1 ppb to 5 ppb) and large parts of the 
continental unpolluted regions.  The sensitivity of annual mean surface ozone to the level of surface warming 
over these remote areas varies spatially from -0.2 to -2 ppb oC-1 (see Figure 6.SM.1 in the Supplementary 
Material) 
 
Over ozone producing regions of the world, such as in North America, Europe, and East Asia, AR5 and post 
AR5 model studies project a general increase of surface ozone levels (climate change penalty on ozone) in a 
future warmer climate particularly during summertime (Fu and Tian, 2019). However, in current regional 
models, using more robust protocols, this increase of surface ozone, attributable to climate change is of 
lower magnitude than in previous estimates (Lacressonnière et al., 2016; Garcia-Menendez et al., 2017). 
Climate change enhances the efficiency of precursor emissions to generate surface ozone in polluted regions, 
(Schnell et al., 2016) and thus the magnitude of this effect will depend on the emissions considered in the 
study (present or future, and mitigated or not) (Colette et al., 2015; Fiore et al., 2015).   
 
Considering anthropogenic emissions of precursors globally higher than the current emissions (SSP3-7.0 in 
2050, see Figure 6.20), the CMIP6 ensemble confirms the surface O3 penalty due to climate change over 
regions close to anthropogenic pollution sources or close to natural emission sources of ozone precursors 
(e.g. biomass burning areas), with a penalty of a few ppb for the annual mean, proportional to warming 
levels (Figure 6.14). This rate ranges regionally from 0.2 to 2 ppb oC-1 (see Figure 6.SM.1 in Supplementary 
Material). The CMIP6 ESMs show this consistently for South East Asia (in line with Hong et al., (2019) and 
Schnell et al. (2016)) and for India (in line with (Pommier et al., 2018) as well as in parts of Africa and 
South America, close to enhanced BVOC emissions (at least 3 out 4 ESMs agree on the sign of change). The 
results are mixed in polluted regions of Europe and US because of lower anthropogenic precursor emissions 
which leads to a very low sensitivity of surface ozone to climate change (-0.5 ppb °C-1 to 0.5 ppb °C-1) (see 
Figure 6.SM.1 in Supplementary Material) and thus the ESMs can disagree on sign of changes for a given 
warming level. This heterogeneity in the results is also found in regional studies over North America 
(Gonzalez-Abraham et al., 2015; Val Martin et al., 2015; Schnell et al., 2016; He et al., 2018; Nolte et al., 
2018; Rieder et al., 2018) or over Europe (Colette et al., 2015; Lacressonnière et al., 2016; Schnell et al., 
2016; Fortems-Cheiney et al., 2017). 
 
Overall, warmer climate is expected to reduce surface ozone in unpolluted regions as a result of greater water 
vapor abundance accelerating ozone chemical loss (high confidence).  Over regions with high anthropogenic 
and/or natural ozone precursor emissions, there is prevailing evidence that climate change will introduce a 
surface O3 penalty increasing with increasing warming levels (with a magnitude ranging regionally from 0.2 
to 2 ppb °C-1) (medium confidence to high confidence). Yet, there are uncertainties in processes affected in a 
warmer climate which can impact and modify future baseline and regional/local surface ozone levels. The 
response of surface ozone to future climate change through stratosphere-troposphere exchange, soil NOx 
emissions and wildfires is positive (medium confidence). In addition, there is low confidence in the 
magnitude of effect of climate change on surface ozone through biosphere interactions (natural CH₄, non-
methane BVOC emissions and ozone deposition) and lighting NOx emissions.  

<figref>6.14</figref>
 
 
## 6.5.2 Impact of climate change on particulate matter
 
Changes in concentration and chemistry of particulate matter (PM) in a changing climate depend in a 
complex manner on the response of the multiple interactions of changes in emissions, chemical processes, 
deposition and other factors (e.g., temperature, precipitation, circulation patterns). These changes are 
difficult to assess and, at the time of AR5, no confidence level was attached to the overall impact of climate 
change on PM2.5  (Kirtman et al., 2013). Possible changes induced by climate change may concern both 
atmospheric concentration levels and chemical composition. 
 
Higher temperatures increase the reaction rate of gaseous SO₂ to particulate sulphate conversion but also 
favour evaporation of particulate ammonium nitrate (Megaritis et al., 2013). Also, higher temperatures are 
expected to affect BVOC emissions (e.g. Pacifico et al., 2012) that would influence SOA concentrations, 
although this effect has been questioned by more recent evidence (Wang et al., 2018a; Zhao et al., 2019c).  
More generally, climate change will also affect dust concentration levels in the atmosphere (see Section 
6.2.2.4) and the occurrence of forest fires, both very large sources of aerosols to the global troposphere (see 
Section 6.2.1.2.3). 
 
Wet deposition constitutes the main sink for atmospheric PM (Allen et al., 2016b, 2019b; Xu and Lamarque, 
2018). In particular, precipitation frequency has a higher effect on PM wet deposition than precipitation 
intensity (Hou et al., 2018). PM is also sensitive to wind speed and atmospheric stability conditions 
emphasising the importance of stagnation episodes and low planetary boundary layer heights for increasing 
PM atmospheric concentrations (Porter et al., 2015). 
 
At the global scale, depending on its magnitude, the warming leads either to a small increase in global mean 
PM concentration levels (ca. 0.21 g m-3 in 2100 for RCP8.5), mainly controlled by sulphate and organic 
aerosols or a small decrease (-0.06 g m-3 for RCP2.6), Westervelt et al. (2016) and Xu and Lamarque 
(2018). On the other hand, Xu and Lamarque (2018) and Allen et al. (2016c, 2019b) found an increase of 
aerosol burden and PM surface concentration throughout the 21st Century, attributed to a decrease in wet 
removal flux despite the overall projected increase in global precipitation, on the ground of an expected shift 
of future precipitation  towards more frequent heavy events. Based only on three models, the CMIP6 
ensemble shows that for most land areas, there is low agreement between models on the sign of climate 
change on annual mean PM2.5 (see Figure 6.SM.2 in Supplementary Material). 
 
Due to the typical atmospheric lifetime of PM in the atmosphere, of the order of a few days, most studies 
dealing with the future PM concentration levels have a regional character and concern mainly Europe 
(Megaritis et al., 2013; Lacressonnière et al., 2016, 2017; Lemaire et al., 2016; Cholakian et al., 2019), the 
US (Penrod et al., 2014; Fiore et al., 2015; Gonzalez-Abraham et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2017; He et al., 2018; 
Nolte et al., 2018), South and East Asia (Jiang et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2019) and India (Pommier et al., 
2018). No studies are available for other areas of the world. 
 
Changes in the chemical composition of PM as a result of future climate change can also be an important 
issue for the effects of PM on human health and the environment, but only a few sparse data are available in 
the literature on this and the results are, as yet, inconclusive (Im et al., 2012; Jiang et al., 2013; Megaritis et 
al., 2013; Gonzalez-Abraham et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2018; He et al., 2018; Cholakian et al., 2019). 
 
Overall, there is medium confidence (medium evidence, high agreement) in a small effect, positive or 
negative, on PM global burden due to climate change.  
 
 
## 6.5.3 Impact of climate change on extreme pollution  
 
Extreme air pollution is identified as the concentration of an air pollutant that is above a given threshhold 
value (high concentration or a high percentile) as the sensitivity of peak values to meteorological conditions 
can be different from sensitivity of the median or mean (Porter et al., 2015). AR5 assessed with medium 
confidence that uniformly higher temperatures in polluted environments will trigger regional feedbacks in 
chemistry and local emissions that will increase peak ozone and PM pollution, but assessed low confidence 
in projecting changes in meteorological blocking associated with these extreme episodes.  
 
Meteorological conditions, such as heat waves, temperature inversions, and atmospheric stagnation episodes 
favor air quality extremes and are influenced by changing climate (Fiore et al., 2015). The body of literature 
on the connection between climate change and extreme anthropogenic pollution episodes is essentially based 
on correlation and regression applied to observation reanalysis but the metrics and methodologies differ 
making quantitative comparisons difficult. Many emission processes in the natural systems are sensitive to 
temperature, and burst of emissions as a reponse to extreme weather, as in the case of wildfires in dry 
conditions (Bondur et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2020) can occur which would then add to the risk of extreme air 
pollution but are not sufficiently constrained to be quantitatively assessed. 
 
Since AR5, published studies provide augmented evidence for the connections between extreme ozone and 
PM pollution events and high temperatures, especially long-lasting heat waves, whose frequency is 
increasing due to a warming climate (Lelieveld et al., 2014; Porter et al., 2015; Hou and Wu, 2016; Schnell 
and Prather, 2017; Zhang et al., 2017b) (Sun et al., 2017) Jing et al., 2017. However, relationship between air 
pollution and individual meteorological parameters is exaggerated because of covariation on synoptic time 
scales (Fiore et al., 2015). For example, heatwaves are often associated with clear-skies and stagnation, 
making clear attribution to specific meteorological variable complicated. In Asia, future changes in winter 
conditions have also been shown to favour more particulate pollution (Cai et al., 2017), and  (Zou et al. 
(2017). The relationship between the occurrence of stagnation episodes and high concentrations of ozone and 
PM2.5 has been shown to be regionally and metric dependant  (Oswald et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2017; Kerr and 
Waugh, 2018; Schnell et al., 2018; Garrido-Perez et al., 2019). 
 
The increase of heatwaves frequency, duration and intensity is extremely likely on all continents for different 
future warming levels (Chapter 11, see Table 11.2 and Section 11.3.5). However, there is low confidence in 
projected changes in storm tracks, jets, and blocking and thus their influence in extreme temperatures in mid-
latitudes (See Section 11.3.1).  
 
In conclusion, there is still medium confidence that climate driven changes in meterorological conditions, 
such as heatwaves or stagnations, will favour extreme air pollution episodes over highly polluted areas, 
however the relationship between these meteorological conditions and high concentrations of ozone and 
PM2.5 have been shown to be regionally and metric dependant. 


# 6.6  Air Quality and Climate response to SLCF mitigation 
 
LLGHG emission reductions are typically motivated by climate mitigation policies, whereas SLCF 
reductions mostly result from air pollution control, climate policies (see FAQ6.2) as well as policies focusing 
on achieving UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (see Box 6.2). The management of several SLCFs 
(BC, CH₄, tropospheric O3, and HFCs) is considered in the literature as a fast-response, near-term measure to 
curb climate change, while reduction of emissions of LLGHGs is an essential measure for mitigating long-
term climate warming (Shindell et al., 2012a, 2017a; Shoemaker et al., 2013; Rogelj et al., 2014b; Lelieveld 
et al., 2019). Note that the term short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) refering only to warming SLCFs has 
been used within the policy arena. The SR 1.5 report states that limiting warming to 1.5°C to achieve Paris 
Agreement goals, implies net zero CO₂ emissions around 2050 and concurrent deep reductions in emissions 
of non-CO₂ forcers, particularly methane (Rogelj et al., 2018a). In addition, several SLCFs are key air 
pollutants or precursors of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and tropospheric O3 and therefore subject to 
control driven by air quality targets.  
 
Policies addressing either SLCFs or LLGHGs reduction, often prioritize mitigation of specific anthropogenic 
sources, such as energy production, industry, transportation, agriculture, waste management, and residential 
fuel use. Choice of the targetted sector and chosen measures will determine the ratios of emitted SLCFs and 
LLGHGs. These changes in emissions of co-emitted species will result in diverse responses driven by 
complex chemical and physical processes and resulting climate perturbations (see Section 6.5). The 
understanding of the co-benefits through sectoral mitigation efforts (as well as potential negative impacts) is 
essential to inform policy making.  
 
The discussion of targeted SLCF policies and their role in climate change mitigation ranges from critical 
evaluation of the climate co-benefits (Smith and Mizrahi, 2013; Pierrehumbert, 2014; Rogelj et al., 2014b; 
Strefler et al., 2014; Allen et al., 2016a), modelling the potential of dedicated BC and CH₄ reductions in 
association with or without climate policy (Harmsen et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2020), individual or multi-
component mitigation in relation to natural variability (Samset et al., 2020), warning about the risk of 
diversion of resources from LLGHGs, especially CO₂, policies (e.g., Shoemaker et al., 2013), to seeing it as 
an opportunity to strengthen commitment and accelerate action on LLGHGs (Victor et al., 2015; Aakre et al., 
2018).  
 
Over the last decade, research on air quality-climate interactions and feedbacks has brought new attention of 
policy communities on the possibility of win-win mitigation policies that could both improve air quality and 
mitigate climate change, possibly also reducing the cost of interventions (Anenberg et al., 2012; Shindell et 
al., 2012a, 2017a, Schmale et al., 2014a, 2014b; Sadiq et al., 2017; Fay et al., 2018; Harmsen et al., 2020). 
Haines et al. (2017a) and Shindell et al. (2017a) connect the measures to mitigate SLCFs with the 
achievements of some of the SDGs. Indeed, most studies on co-benefits to date focus on the impacts of 
climate mitigation strategies, in particular to meet Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and/or 
specific global temperature targets, on air quality and human health (West et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2016; 
Rao et al., 2016; Shindell et al., 2016, 2017a; Chang et al., 2017; Haines et al., 2017a; Xie et al., 2018; Li et 
al., 2018a; Markandya et al., 2018; Williams et al., 2018; Lelieveld et al., 2019). Such co-benefits of climate 
mitigation for air quality and human health can offset the costs of the climate measures (Saari et al., 2015; Li 
et al., 2018a). A growing number of studies analyse the co-benefits of current and planned air quality 
policies on LLGHGs and global and regional climate change impacts (Lund et al., 2014a; Akimoto et al., 
2015; Lee et al., 2016; Maione et al., 2016; Peng et al., 2017). 
 
This section assesses the effects of mitigating SLCFs, motivated by various objectives, discussing 
temperature response time, temperature and air quality attribution of SLCFs sources, and chosen mitigation 
approach. The effects of the measures, to contain the spread of COVID-19 in 2020, on air quality (AQ) and 
climate are discussed in cross-chapter Box 6.1 at the end of this section.  
 

## 6.6.1 Implications of lifetime on temperature response time horizon 
 
The effect over time on GSAT following a mitigation effort affecting emissions of LLGHGs or SLCFs 
depends on the lifetimes of the LLGHGs and SLCFs, their radiative efficiencies, how fast the emissions are 
reduced, how long reductions last (limited time or sustained reduction), and the inertia of the climate system 
itself. Mitigation of SLCFs are often implemented through new legislation or technology standards for the 
different emission sectors and components, implying that reductions are sustained over time.   
 
It is often perceived that the full climatic response following mitigation of SLCFs will occur almost 
immediately. However the inertia of the climate system strongly modifies the short-term and long-term 
response. SLCFs with lifetimes shorter than the time scales for interhemisheric mixing (1-2 years) can cause 
a more spatially heterogeneous forcing than LLGHGs and thus different regional patterns of the climate 
response (see Sections 6.4.3). The temporal response in GSAT to a radiative forcing can be quantified using 
linear impulse response functions (see Cross Chapter box 7.1), (Olivié and Peters, 2013; Geoffroy et al., 
2013; Smith et al., 2018). Figure 6.15 shows the GSAT response for sustained step reduction in emissions of 
idealised SLCFs with different lifetimes. The response is relative to a baseline with constant emissions, so 
effects of emissions before the step reduction is not shown. For SLCFs with lifetimes shorter than a few 
years, the concentrations quickly reach a new steady state and the response time is primarily governed by the 
thermal inertia and thus the time scales of the climate system. For compounds with lifetime on the order of 
10 years (for example methane), there is about a 10-year delay in the response during the first decades, 
compared to compounds with lifetimes less than one year. However on longer time scales the response is 
determined solely by the time scales of the climate system itself. For CO₂ (dashed line in Figure 6.15) the 
temporal response is very different due to the long time scale for mixing into the deep ocean and therefore a 
substantial fraction of atmospheric CO₂ is only removed on millenium time scales. This means that for 
SLCFs including methane, the rate of emissions drives the long term stabilisation, as opposed to CO₂ where 
the long term effect is controlled by cumulative emissions (Allen et al., 2018b). Methods to compare rates of 
SLCF emission with cumulative CO₂ emissions are discussed in chapter 7, section 7.6.1.4. 
 
<figref>6.15</figref>  
 
As a consequence, in idealized ESM studies that assume an instantaneous removal of all anthropogenic or 
fossil fuel-related emissions, a rapid change in aerosol levels occurs leading to large increases in GSAT with 
the rate of warming lasting for several years. Similarly, the thermal inertia causes the pulse emissions (Figure 
6.16) of SLCFs to have a significant effect on surface temperature even after 10 years.  
 
In summary, for SLCFs with short lifetime (e.g. months), the response in surface temperature occurs strongly 
as soon as a sustained change in emissions is implemented and continues to grow for a few years, primarily 
due to thermal inertia in the climate system (high confidence). Near its maximum, the response slows down 
but will then take centuries to reach equilibrium (high confidence). For SLCF with longer lifetimes (e.g. a 
decade), a delay equivalent to their lifetimes comes in addition to the delay due the thermal inertia (high 
confidence).  
 

## 6.6.2 Attribution of temperature and air pollution changes to emission sectors and regions  
 
Assessment of the temperature response to source emission sectors is important for identifying priority 
mitigation measures and designing efficient mitigation strategies.  
 
Temperature effects of emissions can be quantified for the historical contribution to the present temperature 
impact (see 6.4.2), for idealized one-year pulses of emissions or for continued (sustained) emissions at 
present levels and for changes during a specific time period, for emissions from future scenarios with various 
hypotheses, giving complementary information to feed mitigation strategies. AR5 assessed the net global 
temperature impact of source emission sectors from a one-year pulse (single year worth) of year 2008 
emissions and found that the largest contributors to warming on 50-100 year time scales are the energy, 
industrial and on-road transportation sectors. Sectors that emit large amounts of methane (agriculture and 
waste management) and black carbon (residential biofuel) are important contributors to warming over short 
time horizons up to 20 years. Below, we discuss the effect on ERFs, temperature and air pollution of selected 
key sectors estimated to have large non-CO₂ forcing, including agriculture, residential and commercial, and 
transport (aviation, shipping, land transportation). 
 
 
### 6.6.2.1  Agriculture  
 
According to the SRCCL assessment (Jia et al., 2019), agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) is a 
significant net source of GHG emissions (high confidence), with more than half of these emissions attributed 
to non-CO₂ GHGs from agriculture. With respect to SLCFs, agricultural activities are major global sources 
of CH₄ and NH<sub>3</sub> (Section 6.2.1). The agriculture sector exerts strong near term warming due to large CH₄ 
emission that is slightly offset by a small cooling from secondary inorganic aerosols formed notably from the 
NH<sub>3</sub> emission (Heald and Geddes, 2016b; Lund et al., 2020). For present day emissions, agriculture is the 2nd 
largest contributor to warming on short time scales but with a small persisting effect on surface temperature 
(+0.0012±0.00028°C) after a pulse of current emissions (Lund et al., 2020 and Figure 6.16, see detailed 
description in 6.6.2.3.4). Aerosols produced from agricultural emissions, released after nitrogen fertilizer 
application and from animal husbandry, influence surface air quality and make an important contribution to 
surface PM2.5 in many densely populated areas (Lelieveld et al., 2015b; Bauer et al., 2016) and Figure 6.17. 
 
 
### 6.6.2.2  Residential and Commercial cooking, heating 
 
The residential and commercial sector is associated with SLCF emissions of carbonaceous aerosol, CO and 
VOCs, SO₂ and NOx and can be split by fuel type (biofuel or fossil fuel) where residential fossil fuel is also 
associated with CO₂ and CH₄ emissions (Section 6.2.1). The impacts of residential CO and VOC emissions 
are warming and SO₂ and NOx are net cooling. However, the net sign of the global radiative effects of 
carbonaceous aerosols from the residential sector and solid fuel cookstove emissions (warming or cooling) is 
not well constrained based on evidence from recent global atmospheric modelling studies. Estimates of 
global residential sector direct aerosol-radiation effects range from -20 to +60 mW m-2 (Kodros et al., 2015) 
and -66 to +21 mW m-2 (Butt et al., 2016); and aerosol-cloud effects range from -20 to +10 mWm-2 (Kodros 
et al., 2015) and -52 to -16 mW m-2 (Butt et al., 2016). Uncertainties are due to assumptions about the 
aerosol emission masses, size distribution, aerosol optical properties and mixing states (see Section 6.3.5.3). 
Allowing BC to act as an INP in a global model leads to a much larger global forcing estimate from -275 to 
+154 mW m-2 with large uncertainty range due to uncertainty in the plausible range of maximum freezing 
efficiency of BC (Huang et al., 2018). The net sign of the impacts of carbonaceous aerosols from residential 
burning on radiative forcing and climate (warming or cooling) is ambiguous. The residential biofuel sector is 
a major concern for indoor air quality (Bonjour et al., 2013). In addition, several atmospheric modelling 
studies find that this sector is also important for outdoor air quality and even a dominant source of 
population-weighted outdoor PM2.5 in India and China (Lelieveld et al., 2015b; Silva et al., 2016a; Spracklen 
et al., 2018, Figure 6.17; Reddington et al., 2019). 

The net climate impact of the residential sector is warming in the near term of +0.0018±0.00084°C for fossil 
fuel use and +0.0014±0.0012°C for biofuel use, and +0.0017±0.00017°C and +0.0001±0.000079°C, 
respectively over a 100 years horizon, after a one year pulse of current emissions (Lund et al., 2020), due to 
the effects of BC, CH₄, CO and VOCs which adds to that of CO₂ but the uncertainty in the net sign of 
carbonaceous aerosol impacts challenges overall quantitative understanding of this sector and leads to low 
confidence in this assessment. Residential sector emissions are an important source of indoor and outdoor air 
pollution in Asia and globally (high confidence). 
 
 
### 6.6.2.3  Transportation 
 
#### 6.6.2.3.1  Aviation 
Aviation is associated with a range of SLCFs from emissions of NOx, aerosol particles, and NOx, alongside 
its emissions of water vapour and CO₂. The largest SLCF effects are those from the formation of persistent 
condensation trails (contrails) and NOx emissions. Persistent contrails are ice crystal clouds, formed around 
aircraft soot particles (and water vapour from the engine), when the ambient cold and ice-supersaturated 
atmosphere, which can spread and form contrail cirrus clouds. The ‘net NOx’ effect arises from the formation 
of tropospheric O3, counterbalanced by the destruction of ambient CH₄ and associated cooling effects of 
reductions in stratospheric water vapour and background O3. AR5 assessed the radiative forcing from 
persistent linear contrails to be +0.01 (+0.005 to +0.03) W m–2 for year 2011, with a medium confidence 
(Boucher et al., 2013). The combined linear contrail and their subsequent evolution to contrail cirrus 
radiative forcing from aviation was assessed to be +0.05 (+0.02 to +0.15) W m–2, with a low confidence. An 
additional forcing of +0.003 W m–2 due to emissions of water vapour in the stratosphere by aviation was also 
reported (Boucher et al., 2013). The aviation sector was also estimated to lead to a net surface warming at 20 
and 100 years horizons following a one year pulse emission. This net temperature response was determined 
by similar contributions from contrails and contrail cirrus and CO₂ over a 20 year time horizon, and 
dominated by CO₂ in a 100 years perspective (Figure 8.34 AR5: Myhre et al., 2013).  
 
Our assessment builds on Lee et al. (2020a). Their study consists of an updated, comprehensive assessment 
of aviation climate forcing in terms of RF and ERF based on a large number of studies and the most recent 
air traffic and fuel use datasets available (for 2018), new calculations and the normalization of values from 
published modeling studies, and combining the resulting best estimates via a Monte-Carlo analysis. Lee et al. 
(2020a),  reports a net aviation ERF for year 2018 emissions of +0.101 W m-2 (5–95% likelihood range of 
0.055–0.145) with major contributions from contrail cirrus (0.057 W m-2), CO₂ (0.034 W m-2), and NOx 
(0.017 W m-2). Contrails and aviation-induced cirrus yields the largest individual positive ERF term, whose 
confidence level is similarly assessed to Lee et al. (2020a), as ‘low’ by Chapter 7 (Section 7.3.4.2) due to 
potential missing processes, followed by CO₂ and NOx emissions (Lee et al., 2020a). The formation and 
emission of sulphate aerosol yields a negative (cooling) term. SLCF forcing terms contribute about 8 times 
more than CO₂ to the uncertainty in the aviation net ERF in 2018 (Lee et al., 2020a). The largest uncertainty 
in assessing aviation climate effects is on the interactions of BC and sulphate aerosols on cirrus and mixed 
phase clouds, for which no best estimates of the ERFs were provided (Lee et al., 2020a). 
 
One of the most significant changes between AR5 and AR6 in terms of aviation SLCFs is the explicit 
calculation of a contrail cirrus ERF found to be 35% of the corresponding RF Bickel et al. (2020), which has 
confirmed studies indicating smaller efficacy of linear contrails Ponater et al. (2005) and Rap et al. (2010). 
The net-NOx term is generally agreed to be a positive RF in the present day, although attribution in a non-
linear chemical system is problematic (Grewe et al., 2019) but Skowron et al. (2021) point out that the sign 
of net NOx term is dependent on background conditions and could be negative under certain future scenarios. 
 
The best estimate ERFs from aviation (Lee et al., 2020b) have been used to calculate aviation-specific 
Absolute Global Temperature change Potential (AGTP) using the method described in (Lund et al., 2020) 
and subsequently compute the effect of one-year pulse of aviation emissions on global-mean surface 
temperature on a 10- and 100-year time horizon (Figure 6.16, see 6.6.2.3.4). The effect of contrail-cirrus is 
most important for the estimated net GSAT response after the first decade, followed by similar warming 
contributions from NOx and CO₂ emissions. At a 20-year time horizon, the net contribution from aviation to 
GSAT has switched from positive to a small negative effect (see 6.SM.4). This is due to the combination of 
rapidly decaying contrail-cirrus warming and the complex time variation of the net temperature response to 
NOx emissions, which changes sign between 10 and 20 years due to the balance between the positive short-
lived ozone forcing and negative forcing from changes in CH₄ and CH₄-induced changes in ozone and 
stratospheric water vapour. The net GSAT response to aviation emissions has previously been estimated to 
be positive on a 20-year time horizon (Chapter 8 AR5; Lund et al., 2017). This difference in net GSAT after 
20 years in AR5 compared to AR6 results primarily from a shorter time scale of the climate response in the 
underlying AGTP calculations in Lund et al. (2020), which means the initial, strong impacts of the most 
short-lived SLFCs, including the warming by contrail-cirrus decay faster, in turn giving the net NOx effect a 
relatively higher importance after 20 years. On longer time horizons, the net GSAT response switches back 
to positive, as CO₂ becomes the dominating warming contribution. 
 
In summary, the net aviation ERF is assessed to be +0.1 W m-2 (±0.045) for the year 2018 (low confidence). 
This confidence level is largely a result of the fact that the SLCF-related terms which counts for more than 
half (66% of the net aviation ERF) are the most uncertain terms. The climate response to SLCF-related 
aviation terms exhibits substantial spatiotemporal heterogeneity in characteristics (high confidence). Overall, 
cirrus and contrail cirrus warming, as well as NOx-induced ozone increase, induce strong, but short-lived 
warming contributions to the GSAT response ten years after a one-year pulse of present-day aviation 
emissions (medium confidence), while CO₂ both gives a warming effect in the near term and dominates the 
long-term warming impact (high-confidence).     
 
 
#### 6.6.2.3.2  Shipping 
Quantifying the effects of shipping on climate is particularly challenging because (i) the sulphate cooling 
impact is dominated by aerosol cloud interactions and (ii) ship emissions contain NOx, SOx and BC, which 
lead to mixed particles. Previous estimates of the sulphate radiative effects from present day shipping span 
the range -47 to -8 mW m-2 (direct radiative effect) and -600 to -38 mW m-2 (indirect radiative effects) 
(Balkanski et al., 2010; Eyring et al., 2010; Lauer et al., 2007; Lund et al., 2012). Partanen et al. (2013) 
reported a global mean ERF for year 2010 shipping aerosol emissions of -390 mW m-2. The temperature 
change has been shown to be highly sensitive to the choice of aerosol-cloud parameterization (Lund et al., 
2012).  One year of global present-day shipping emissions, not considering impact of recent low sulphur fuel 
regulation (IMO, 2016), are estimated to cause net cooling in the near term (-0.0024±0.0025°C) and slight 
warming (+0.00033±0.00015°C) on a 100-year horizon (Lund et al., 2020).  
 
Shipping is also of importance for air pollution in coastal areas along the major trade routes, especially in 
Europe and Asia (Corbett et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2016b, Figure 6.17; Jonson et al., 2020). Jonson et al. 
(2020) estimated that shipping is responsible for 10% or more of the controllable PM2.5 concentrations and 
depositions of oxidised nitrogen and sulphur for many coastal countries. Widespread introduction of low-
sulphur fuels in shipping from 2020 (IMO, 2016) will lead to improved air quality and reduction in 
premature mortality and morbidy (Sofiev et al., 2018). 
 
In summary, one year of present-day global shipping emissions (i.e., without the implementation of the 2020 
clean fuel standards) cause a net global cooling (-0.0024±0.0025°C) on 10-20 year time horizons (high 
confidence) but its magnitude is of low confidence. 
 
 
#### 6.6.2.3.3  Land transportation 
The on-road and off-road transportation sectors have a net warming impact on climate over all time scales 
(Berntsen and Fuglestvedt, 2008; Fuglestvedt et al., 2008; Unger et al., 2010; Lund et al., 2020). One year 
pulse of present day emissions has a small net global temperature effect on short time-scales 
(+0.0011±0.0045°C), predominantly driven by CO₂ and BC warming offset by NOx-induced cooling through 
CH₄ lifetime reductions (Lund et al., 2020). 
 
The vehicle tailpipe emission profiles of diesel and gasoline are distinctly different. Diesel air pollutant 
emissions are dominated by BC and NOx whereas petrol air pollutant emissions are dominated by CO and 
NMVOCs, especially when distribution and upstream losses are considered. Thus, net radiative effect of the 
on-road vehicle fleets depends upon the share of different fuels used, in particular gasoline and diesel (Lund 
et al., 2014b; Huang et al., 2020b). The net SLCF for year 2010 emissions from the global diesel vehicle 
fleet have been estimated to be +28 mW m-2 (Lund et al., 2014b). Huang et al. (2020b) estimated net global 
radiative effects of SLCFs (including aerosols, O3, and CH₄) from the gasoline and diesel vehicle fleets in 
year 2015 at +13.6 and +9.4 mW m-2, respectively, with similar fractional contributions of SLCFs to the total 
global climate impact including CO₂ on the 20‐year time scale (14-15%). 
 
There is a consensus that on‐road transportation sector emissions, including gasoline and diesel, are 
important anthropogenic contributors to elevated surface O3 and PM2.5 concentrations (Chambliss et al., 
2014; Lelieveld et al., 2015b; Silva et al., 2016a, Figure 6.17; Anenberg et al., 2019). At a global-scale, land 
transportation has been estimated to be the dominant contributor to surface ozone concentrations in 
populated areas (Silva et al., 2016b) and O3-induced vegetation damages (Section 6.4.4) (Unger et al., 2020). 
Furthermore, it is now well established that real world diesel NOx emission rates are substantially higher, the 
so-called “excess NOx”, in all regional markets than in laboratory tests worsening air quality (Anenberg et 
al., 2017; Jonson et al., 2017; Chossière et al., 2018) and contributing to slightly larger warming on the scale 
of years and smaller warming at the decadal scale (Tanaka et al., 2018). Excess NOx emissions from key 
global diesel markets are estimated at 4.6 Tg a-1 in 2015, with annual mean O3 and PM2.5 increases of 1 ppb 
and 1g m-3 across large-regions of Europe, India and China (Anenberg et al., 2017). 
 
In summary, the present-day global land-based transport pulse emissions cause a net global warming on all 
time scales (high confidence) and are detrimental to air quality (high confidence). 
 
 
#### 6.6.2.3.4  GSAT response to emission pulse of current emissions
Figure 6.16 presents the GSAT response to an idealized pulse of year 2014 emissions of individual SLCF 
and LLGHG. The GSAT response is calculated for 11 sectors and 10 regions accounting for best available 
knowledge and geographical dependence of the forcing efficacy of different SLCFs (Lund et al., 2020). Two 
time horizons are shown (10 and 100 year) to represent near- and long-term effects (and 20 year horizon is 
presented in Figure 6.SM.3). Other time horizon choices may affect the relative importance, and even sign in 
the case of the NOx effect, of the temperature response from some of the SLCFs, or be more relevant for 
certain applications. GSAT response is calculated using the concept of AGTP (see Section 7.6.2.2). Further 
details of the AGTP emulator applied in Figure 6.16 are provided in (Lund et al., 2020) and 6.SM.4 (see also 
Section 7.6.1.2, cross-chapter Box 7.1 and 7.SM.7.2). As discussed in Lund et al. (2020), the AGTP 
framework is primarily designed to study relative importance of individual emissions and sources, but the 
absolute magnitude of temperature responses should be interpreted with care due to the linearity of the 
AGTP, which does not necessarily capture all the non-linear effects of SLCFs emissions on temperature. 
 
Differences in the mix of emissions result in net effects on GSAT that vary substantially, in both magnitude 
and sign, between sectors and regions. SLCFs contribute substantially to the GSAT effects of sectors on 
short time horizons (10-20 years) but CO₂ dominates on longer time horizons (Figure 6.16). As the effect of 
the SLCFs decays rapidly over the first few decades after emission, the net long-term temperature effect is 
predominantly determined by CO₂. N2O adds a small contribution to the long-term effect of agriculture. CO₂ 
emissions cause an important contribution to near-term warming that is not always fully acknowledged in 
discussions of LLGHGs and SLCFs (Lund et al., 2020).  
 
The global sectoral ranking for near- and long-term global temperature effects is similar to the AR5 
assessment despite regional reductions in aerosol precursor emissions between 2008 and 2014. This report 
has applied updated climate policy metrics for SLCFs and treatment of aerosol-cloud interactions for SO₂, 
BC and OC (Lund et al., 2020). By far the largest 10-year GSAT effects are from the energy production 
(fossil fuel mining and distribution), agriculture and waste management (high confidence). CH₄ is the 
dominant contributor in the energy production, agriculture, and waste management sectors. On the 10-year 
time horizon, other net warming sectors are residential fossil fuel and energy combustion (dominated by 
CO₂) and aviation and residential biofuel (dominated by SLCFs and cloud) (medium confidence). The total 
residential and commercial sector including biofuel and fossil fuels is the 4th most warming economic sector 
globally on short time horizons of 10-20 years. The energy combustion sector has considerable cooling from 
high emissions of SO₂ that result in a relatively small net GSAT temperature effect on short time horizons, 
despite the high CO₂ emissions from this activity. On the 10-year time horizon, global emissions from 
industry and shipping cause a net cooling effect despite a considerable warming from CO₂ emissions. On the 
100-year time horizon, the net effects of agriculture and waste management are small, while energy 
combustion is the largest individual contributor to warming due to its high CO₂ emissions. The second 
largest driver of long-term temperature change is industry, demonstrating the importance of non-CO₂ 
emissions for shaping relative weight over different time frames. Transport contributes a small net warming 
on the 10-year time horizon that increases by a factor of three on the 100-year time horizon. In contrast, 
aviation sector contribution to warming shrinks by about a factor of three between the 10- and 100-year time 
horizons. Results for the 20-year time horizon are provided in the Supplementary Material 6.SM.4. 
Compared to the 10-year time horizon, there are some changes in ranking, especially of sectors and regions 
with a strong SO₂ contribution, which decays substantially between 10 and 20 years. Aviation is the sector 
with most distinct difference between 10 and 20 year time horizons such that the net GSAT effect after 20 
years becomes small but negative due to a switch in sign for the NOx AGTP for this sector and these two 
time horizons related to the stronger short-lived ozone response than other sectors. 
 
In terms of source regions, the largest contributions to net short-term warming are caused by emissions in 
Eastern Asia, Latin America and North America, followed by Africa, Eastern Europe and West-Central Asia 
and South East Asia (medium confidence). However, the relative contributions from individual species vary. 
In East Asia, North America, Europe and South Asia the effect of current emissions of cooling and warming 
SLCFs approximately balance in the near term and these regions cause comparable net warming effects on 
10- and 100-year time horizons (Figure 6.16). In Latin America, Africa and South East Asia and Developing 
Pacific, CH₄ and BC emissions are currently high while emissions of CO₂ and cooling aerosols are low 
compared to other regions, resulting in a net warming effect after 10 years that is substantially higher than 
that of CO₂ alone.  
 
Overall, the global sectors that contribute the largest warming on short time scales are the CH₄-dominated 
sources, i.e., energy production (fossil fuel mining and distribution), agriculture and waste management 
(high confidence). On short time scales, other net warming sectors are residential fossil fuel and energy 
combustion (dominated by CO₂) and aviation and residential biofuel (dominated by SLCFs) (medium 
confidence). On short-time scales, global emissions from industry and shipping cause a net cooling effect 
despite a considerable warming from CO₂ emissions (high confidence). On longer time horizons, the sectors 
that contribute the largest warming are energy combustion and industry due to the large CO₂ emissions (high 
confidence).  
 
 
#### 6.6.2.3.5  Source attribution of regional air pollution 
The attribution of present-day surface PM2.5 and O3 concentrations to sectors and regions (Figure 6.17) is 
based on 2014 CMIP6 emissions used in the TM5-FASST model (Van Dingenen et al., 2018) that has been 
widely applied to analyse air quality in regional and global scenarios (Van Dingenen et al., 2009; Rao et al., 
2016, 2017; Vandyck et al., 2018; e.g., Harmsen et al., 2020).  Regions with largest year 2014 population-
weighted annual average surface PM2.5 concentrations are South Asia, East Asia, and Middle East. The 
dominant anthropogenic source of ambient PM2.5 in South Asia is residential and commercial sector 
(biomass and coal fuel-based cooking and heating) with secondary contributions from energy and industry. 
In East Asia, the main anthropogenic sources of ambient PM2.5 are energy, industry and residential sources. 
Natural sources, predominantly dust, are the most important PM2.5 source in the Middle East, Africa and 
Eurasia, contributing about 40-70% of ambient annual average concentrations (Figure 6.17). Agriculture is 
an important contributor to ambient PM2.5 in Europe and North America, while open biomass burning is a 
major contributor in South East Asia and Developing Pacific, North America as well as Latin America. 
These results are consistent with several global and regional studies, where contribution of emission sources 
to ambient PM2.5 or premature mortality was estimated at different scales (Guttikunda et al., 2014; Lelieveld 
et al., 2015b; e.g., Amann et al., 2017; Qiao et al., 2018; Venkataraman et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018).  
 
Natural sources contribute more than 50% to surface ozone in all regions except South Asia and South East 
Asia. South Asia, East Asia and the Middle East experience the highest surface ozone levels of all regions. 
For ozone, the anthropogenic sectoral attribution is more uniform across regions than for PM2.5, except for 
South and Southeast Asia where land transportation plays are larger role and East Asia with most significant 
contribution from energy and industry. Land transportation and energy are the most important contributors to 
ozone across many of the regions, with smaller contributions from agriculture, biomass burning, waste 
management and industry. Open biomass burning is not a major contributor to surface ozone, except for 
Africa, Latin America and South East Asia where its contribution is estimated at about 5-10% of 
anthropogenic sources. Relative importance of natural and anthropogenic emission sources on surface ozone 
have been assessed in several studies (Uherek et al., 2010; Zare et al., 2014; Mertens et al., 2020; Unger et 
al., 2020) and the results are comparable with the estimates of the TM5-FASST used here. 
 
Residential and commercial cooking and heating is among the most important anthropogenic sources of 
ambient PM2.5, except Middle East and Asia-Pacific Developed (high confidence) and agriculture is the 
dominant source in Europe and North America (medium confidence). Energy and industry are important 
PM2.5 contributors in most regions, except Africa (high confidence). Energy and land transportation are the 
major anthropogenic sources of ozone across many world regions (medium to high confidence).

## 6.6.3  Past and current SLCF reduction policies and future mitigation opportunities  
 
Several SLCF emission reduction strategies have been explored in the literature or are already pursued as 
part of the environmental and development policies, including air quality, waste management, energy 
poverty, and climate change. The effects of various policies and strategies have been addressed in a limited 
number of modelling studies having different objectives and range from assessment of specific policies and 
their regional effects (UNEP and WMO, 2011; Shindell et al., 2012a, 2017a, AMAP, 2015a, 2015b; Haines 
et al., 2017a; UNEP and CCAC, 2018; Harmsen et al., 2019; UNEP, 2019) to large-scale global scenario 
studies with varying level of SLCF control (Sand et al., 2016; e.g., Rogelj et al., 2018b; Shindell and Smith, 
2019). They could be grouped into:  
 

- Projections of future SLCF emissions compatible with the climate mitigation trajectories 
investigated in the climate model intercomparison projects (respective RCP or SSP scenarios): In 
such scenarios, when climate change mitigation is considered, it is associated with strong decrease of 
CO₂ emissions, largely relying on fossil fuel use reduction, the co-emitted SLCFs from combustion 
and methane from production and distribution of fossil fuels will be reduced proportionally. 
Depending on carbon price and climate mitigation target, further reduction of methane from waste 
and agriculture will also be part of such scenarios. Limitations of RCP scenarios, where continuous 
strengthening of air quality legislation was assumed and therefore lack of futures where global and 
regional air quality deteriorates, for the analysis of air quality and potential for mitigation of SLCFs 
have been discussed in literature (e.g., Amann et al., 2013; Von Schneidemesser et al., 2015). SSP 
scenarios consider various levels of air pollution control, in accordance with their socioeconomic 
narrative, and thus cover a wider span of SLCF trajectories (Section 6.7). The economical cost of 
implementation of these scenarios and their co-benefits on air quality and SDGs are assessed in 
WGIII (Chapter 3) reports.  

- Projections of SLCF emissions assuming strong reduction of all air pollutants in the absence of 
climate mitigation (e.g., the SSP3-LowSLCF scenario); the latter is an idealized simulation of a very 
ambitious air quality policy where maximum technical potential of existing end-of-pipe technologies 
is explored in the SSP3-7.0 scenario. Methane reduction can also be part of such sensitivity analysis 
although methane reductions have not historically been motivated by air pollution concerns.  

- Projection of emissions targeting air quality or other development priorities: Anthropogenic 
emissions source-structure and the level of exposure to pollution and subsequent effects vary 
significantly from one region to another (section 6.3.2). Therefore, the air quality policy, regional 
climate impact concerns as well as development priorities, and consequently the level of mitigation 
of particular SLCF species, will differ regionally and source-wise with respect to the emissions 
sources, influence of intercontinental transport of pollution, and spatial physical heterogeneities 
(Lund et al., 2014b; AMAP, 2015a; Sand et al., 2016; Turnock et al., 2016; Sofiev et al., 2018; 
WMO, 2018). This is also the case at a finer local and regional scale where priorities and scope for 
SLCF mitigation will differ (e.g., Amann et al., 2017; UNEP, 2019).  

- Projections exploring mitigation potential for a particular source or SLCF: These studies focus on 
the assessment of SLCF reduction potential that can be realised with either existing and proven 
technologies or extend the scope to include transformational changes needed to achieve further 
reduction (UNEP and WMO, 2011; Stohl et al., 2015; Velders et al., 2015; Purohit and Höglund-
Isaksson, 2017; e.g., Gómez-Sanabria et al., 2018; UNEP, 2019; Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2020; 
Purohit et al., 2020) – several of these studies are subsequently used for parameterization of the 
models used to develop emission scenarios (e.g., IAM models used in the IPCC process).  

In the following subsections, we assess the SLCF mitigation and its effects as identified in regional and 
global studies evaluating past and current air quality and other SLCF regulations (Sections 6.6.3.1, 6.6.3.2, 
6.6.3.3). Development policies, independent from the CMIP6 assessment framework, including peer-
reviewed studies and initiatives like UNEP, analysing win-win climate, air quality and SDG motivated 
strategies are discussed in Section 6.6.3.4. Note that sensitivity studies where impacts of complete removal 
of particular species are analysed (e.g., Samset et al., 2018) are used sparingly in this assessment. While such 
analysis can be useful for assessing the effect of a zero-emission commitment (see Chapter 4.7.1.1), they do 
not correspond to a realistic SLCF mitigation strategy with plausible pace of implementation and removal of 
co-emitted species (Shindell and Smith, 2019). Discussion of climate and air quality implications of SLCF 
reductions in SSP scenarios is provided in section 6.7.  
 
 
### 6.6.3.1  Climate response to past AQ policies 
 
Air quality policies emerged several decades ago focusing on emission mitigation first driven by local then 
by regional scale air quality and ecosystem damage concerns, that is, health impacts and acidification and 
eutrophication. They have made it possible to reduce or limit pollution exposure in many megacities or 
highly populated regions e.g. in Los Angeles, Mexico City, Houston in North America (Parrish et al., 2011), 
Santiago in Chile (Gallardo et al., 2018), São Paulo in Brazil (Andrade et al., 2017), Europe (Reis et al., 
2012; Crippa et al., 2016; Serrano et al., 2019), and over East Asia during the last decade (Silver et al., 2018; 
Zheng et al., 2018b). However, very few studies have quantified the impact of these policies on climate. AR5 
concluded that air quality control will have consequences on climate including strong regional variability, 
however, no estimates of impacts of specific air quality policy were available. Since AR5, few studies have 
provided estimates of climate relevant indicators affected by significant air pollutant burden changes due to 
air quality policy in selected regions. Turnock et al. (2016) estimated that the strong decrease in NOx, SO₂ 
and PM2.5 emissions in Europe, induced by air quality policies resulting in implementation of abatement 
measures since the 1970s, have caused a surface warming of +0.45±0.11°C and increase of precipitation 
+13±0.8 mm yr-1 over Europe, compared to the scenario without such policies. While the temperature 
increase is likely overestimated since the impact of increase in ammonium nitrate was not considered in this 
study, the simulated European all-sky TOA radiative effect of the European air pollutant mitigation over the 
period 1970-2009 is 2.5 times the change in global mean CO₂ radiative forcing over the same period (Myhre 
et al., 2013b). Other studies found that the recent measures to reduce pollution over China have induced a 
decrease of aerosols and increase of ozone over east China (Li et al., 2019a, 2020a) resulting in an overall 
warming effect mainly due to the dominant effect of sulphate reductions in the period 2012-2017 (Dang and 
Liao, 2019).  
 
 
### 6.6.3.2  Recently decided SLCF relevant global legislation  
 
International shipping emissions regulation: from January 2020, a new global standard, proposed by the 
International Maritime Organisation, limits the sulphur content in marine fuels to 0.5% against previous 
3.5% (IMO, 2016). This legislation is considered in the SSP5 and SSP2-4.5 and with a delay of few years in 
SSP3-LowSLCF, SSP1-1.9, and SSP1-2.6, and in other SSP emission scenarios achieved by mid 21st 
century. This global measure aims to reduce the formation of sulphate (and consequently PM2.5) and largely 
reduce the health exposure to PM2.5 especially over India, East China and coastal areas of Africa and the 
Middle East (Sofiev et al., 2018).  Sofiev et al. (2018) used a high spatial and temporal resolution chemistry-
climate model and estimated a net total ERF of +71 mW m-2 associated with this measure and due to lower 
direct aerosol cooling (-3.9 mW m-2) and lower cloud albedo (-67 mW m-2). This value, which correponds to 
80% decrease of the cooling effect of shipping induced by about 8 Tg of SO₂  of avoided emissions, is 
consistent with older estimates which considered similar reduction of emitted sulphur. However, there is 
considerable uncertainty in the indirect forcing since small changes in aerosols, acting as CCNs in clean 
environment, can have disproportionally large effects on the radiative balance. Since sulphate is by far the 
largest component of the radiative forcing (Fuglestvedt et al., 2008) and of surface temperature effect (Figure 
6.16) due to ship emissions over short time scale, limiting the co-emitted SLCFs can not offset the warming 
by sulphur reductions. The reduction of sulphur emission from shipping is assessed to lead to a slight 
warming mainly due to aerosol-cloud interactions (medium evidence, medium agreement). 
 
Kigali Amendment (UNEP, 2016): With the adoption of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol 
(UN, 1987) in 2016, parties agreed to the phasedown of HFCs, substances that are not ozone depleting but 
are climate forcing agents (Papanastasiou et al., 2018). Baseline scenarios, in the absence of controls or only 
pre-Kigali national legislation, projected increased use and emissions of HFCs. All recent baseline 
projections are significantly higher than those used in the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 
scenarios ((Meinshausen et al., 2011) and Figure 6.18). There is low confidence that the high baseline 
(assuming absence of controls, lack of technical progress, and high growth) as developed in Velders et al. 
(2009), resulting in additional warming of about 0.5°C by 2100 (Xu et al., 2013; WMO, 2018), is plausible. 
Evolution of HFC emissions along the baselines consistent with Velders et al. (2009) and Velders et al 
(2015) would result in a global average warming, due to HFCs, relative to 2000, of about 0.1-0.12°C by 
2050 and 0.35–0.5°C and 0.28–0.44°C by 2100, respectively (Xu et al., 2013). The baseline implementation 
considered in SSP5-8.5 (see Section 6.7.1.1) is comparable to the lower bound of projections by Velders et 
al. (2015) (Figure 6.18) and several other studies (Gschrey et al., 2011; Purohit and Höglund-Isaksson, 2017; 
EPA, 2019; Purohit et al., 2020) and result in additional warming of 0.15-0.3°C by 2100 (Figure 6.22) 
(medium confidence).  
 
Efficient implementation of the Kigali Amendment and national and regional regulations has been projected 
to reduce global average warming in 2050 by 0.05°–0.07°C (Klimont et al., 2017c; WMO, 2018) and by 0.2–
0.4°C in 2100 compared with the baseline (see Figure 2.20 of WMO, 2018). Analysis of SSP scenarios based 
on an emulator (Section 6.7.3) shows a comparable mitigation potential of about 0.02–0.07°C in 2050 and 
about 0.1–0.3°C in 2100 (Figure 6.22, SSP5-8.5 versus SSP1-2.6). Furthermore, the energy efficiency 
improvements of cooling equipment alongside the transition to low global warming potential alternative 
refrigerants for refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment could potentially increase the climate benefits 
from the HFC phasedown under the Kigali Amendment (Shah et al., 2015; Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2017; 
Purohit and Höglund-Isaksson, 2017; WMO, 2018). Purohit et al (2020) estimated that depending on the 
expected rate of technological development, improving energy efficiency of stationary cooling technologies, 
and compliance with Kigali Amendment could bring future global electricity-savings of more than 20% of 
expected world’s electricity consumption beyond 2050 or cumulative reduction of about 75-275 Gt CO₂eq 
over the period 2018-2100 (medium confidence). This could potentially double the climate benefits of the 
HFC phase-down of the Kigali Amendment as well as result in small air quality improvements due to 
reduced air pollutant emissions from power sector, i.e., 8-16% reduction of PM2.5, SO₂, NOx (Purohit et al., 
2020). 
 
### 6.6.3.3  Assessment of SLCF mitigation strategies and opportunities   
 
There is a consensus in the literature that mitigation of SLCF emissions plays a central role in simultaneous 
mitigation of climate change, air quality, and other development goals including SDG targets (UNEP and 
WMO, 2011; Shindell et al., 2012b, 2017a, Rogelj et al., 2014b, 2018b; AMAP, 2015a; Haines et al., 2017a; 
Klimont et al., 2017c; UNEP and CCAC, 2018; McCollum et al., 2018; Rafaj et al., 2018; UNEP, 2019). 
There is less agreement in the literature with respect to the actual mitigation potential (or its potential rate of 
implementation), necessary policies to trigger successful implementation, and resulting climate impacts. 
Most studies agree that climate policies, especially those aiming to keep warming below 1.5-2°C, trigger 
large SLCF mitigation co-benefits, (e.g., Rogelj et al., 2014b, 2018b), however, discussion of practical 
implementation of respective policies and SDGs has only started (Haines et al., 2017a). Note that mitigation 
scenarios outside of the SSP framework are assessed here while those within the SSPs are assessed in 
Section 6.7.3.  
 
Focusing on air quality, specifically addressing aerosol SLCFs, by introducing best available technology 
reducing PM2.5, SO₂, NOx in most Asian countries within the 2030-2050 time frame (a strategy that has 
indeed shown reduction in PM2.5 exposure in China) comes, in many regions, short of national regulatory 
PM2.5 concentration standards (often set at 35 µg m-3 for annual mean) (UNEP, 2019). Similarly, global 
studies (Rafaj et al., 2018; Amann et al., 2020) shows that strengthening current air quality policies, 
addressing primarily aerosols and their precursors, will not allow to achieve WHO air quality guidelines 
(annual average concentration of PM2.5 below 10 µg m-3) in many regions.  
 
A multi-model study (four ESMs and six CTMs) found a consistent response to removal of SO₂ emissions 
that resulted in a global mean surface temperature increase of 0.69°C (0.4-0.84°C), while mixed results for a 
global BC-focused deep SLCF reduction, excluding SO₂ and CH₄ mitigation which remain like in the 
baseline (see ECLIPSE in Figure 6.18), concluding about -0.022°C temperature reduction for the decade 
2041-2050; this is derived from their estimate that mitigation of the non-CH₄ species contributed only about 
10% of the global temperature reduction for the strategy where also CH₄ mitigation was included (-0.22°C 
±0.07°C) (Stohl et al., 2015). These results are consistent with studies analysing similar strategies using 
emulators (Smith and Mizrahi, 2013; e.g., Rogelj et al., 2014b). Stohl et al. (2015) analysed also the impact 
of BC-focused mitigation on air quality, estimating large scale regional reduction in PM2.5 mean 
concentration from about 2% in Europe to 20% over India for the decade 2041-2050.   
  
Local response to global reduction can be higher than the global temperature response in particular for 
regions subjected to rapid changes. Hence, mitigation of rapid warming in the Arctic has been subject to 
increasing number of studies (Sand et al., 2013a, 2016; Jiao et al., 2014; AMAP, 2015b, 2015a; Mahmood et 
al., 2016; Christensen et al., 2019). Considering maximum technical mitigation potential for CH₄ globally 
and an idealized strategy reducing key global anthropogenic sources of BC (about 80% reduction by 2030 
and sustained thereafter) and precursors of O3 was estimated to jointly bring a reduction of Arctic warming, 
averaged over the 2041-2050 period, between 0.2 and 0.6°C (AMAP, 2015a; Sand et al., 2016). Stohl et al. 
(2015) have estimated that a global SLCF mitigation strategy (excluding further reduction of SO₂) would 
lead to about twice as high temperature reduction (-0.44°C (-0.39 to -0.49°C)) in the Arctic than the global 
response to such mitigation.   
 
While there is robust evidence that air-quality policies, resulting in reduction of aerosols and ozone, can be 
beneficial for human health but can lead to ‘disbenefits’ for near-term climate change, such trade-offs in 
response to climate mitigation policies is less certain (Shindell and Smith, 2019). Recent studies show that 
very ambitious but plausible gradual phasing out of fossil-fuels in 1.5°C compatible pathways with little or 
no overshoot, lead to a near-term future warming of less than 0.1°C, when considering associated emission 
reduction of both warming and cooling species. This suggests that there may not be a strong conflict, at least 
at the global scale, between climate and air-quality benefits in the case of a worldwide transition to clean 
energy (Shindell and Smith, 2019; Smith et al., 2019). However, at the regional scale, the changes in 
spatially variable emission and abundance changes might result in different responses including implications 
for precipitation, monsoon, etc. (Chapter 8), especially over South Asia (e.g., Wilcox et al., 2020). 
 
Decarbonization of energy supply and end use sectors is among key pillars of any ambitious climate 
mitigation strategy and it would result in improved air quality owing to associated reduction of co-emitted 
SLCF emissions (McCollum et al., 2013; Rogelj et al., 2014b; e.g., Braspenning Radu et al., 2016; Rao et al., 
2016; Stechow et al., 2016; Lelieveld et al., 2019; Shindell and Smith, 2019). Regional studies (Lee et al., 
2016; Shindell et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018b), where significant CO₂ reductions were 
assumed for 2030 and 2050, show consistently reduction of PM2.5 and ozone concentrations resulting in 
important health benefits. However, these improvements are not sufficient to bring PM2.5 levels in agreement 
with the WHO air quality guideline in several regions. Amann et al. (2020) and UNEP (2019) highlight that 
only combination of strong air quality, development, and climate policies, including societal transformations, 
could pave the way towards achievement of such target at a regional and global level.  
 
At a global level, Rao et al. (2016) showed that climate policies, compatible with Copenhagen pledges and a 
long-term CO₂ target of 450 ppm, result in important air quality benefits, reducing the share of global 
population exposed to PM2.5 levels above the WHO Tier 1 standard (35 µg m-3) in 2030 from 21% to 5%. 
The impacts are similar to a strong air quality policy but still leaving large parts of population, especially in 
Asia and Africa, exposed to levels well above WHO air quality guideline level of 10 µg m-3. The latter can 
be partly alleviated by combining such climate policy with strong air quality policy. Shindell et al. (2018) 
analysed more ambitious climate mitigation scenarios than Rao et al. (2016) and highlighted the 
opportunities to improve air quality and avert societal effect associated with warmer climate by accelerated 
decarbonization strategies. Most climate mitigation strategies compatible with limiting global warming to 
well below 2°C, rely on future negative CO₂ emissions postponing immediate reduction. Alternatively, a 
faster decarbonization could allow to achieve a 2°C goal without negative CO₂ emissions and with currently 
known and effectively applied emission control technologies would have also immediate and significant air 
quality benefits, reducing premature deaths worldwide (Shindell et al., 2018). For a 2°C compatible pathway, 
Vandyck et al. (2018) estimated 5% and 15% reduction in premature mortality due to PM2.5 in 2030 and 
2050, respectively, compared to reference scenarios. 
 
There is robust evidence that reducing atmospheric CH₄ will benefit climate and improve air quality through 
near-surface O3 reduction (Fiore et al., 2015; Shindell et al., 2017b) and wide agreement that strategies 
reducing CH₄ offer larger (and less uncertain) climate benefits than policies addressing BC (Smith and 
Mizrahi, 2013; Rogelj et al., 2014b, 2018b; Stohl et al., 2015; e.g., Christensen et al., 2019; Shindell and 
Smith, 2019). SR1.5 (Rogelj et al., 2018b) highlighted the importance of CH₄ mitigation in limiting warming 
to 1.5 ºC in addition to net zero CO₂ emission by 2050. Implementation of the identified maximum technical 
mitigation (MTFR) potential for CH₄ globally, estimated at nearly 50% reduction (or 205 Tg CH₄ in 2050) of 
anthropogenic emissions from the baseline, would lead to a reduction in warming, calculated as the 
differences between the baseline and MTFR scenario, for the 2036-2050 period of about 0.20±0.02°C 
globally (AMAP, 2015b). Plausible levels of methane mitigation, achieved with proven technologies, can 
increase the feasibility of achieving the Paris Agreement goal through slightly slowing down the pace of CO₂ 
reductions (but not changing the final CO₂ reduction goal) while this benefit is enhanced by the indirect 
effects of methane mitigation on ozone levels (Collins et al., 2018). Adressing methane mitigation appears 
even more important in view of recently observed growth in atmospheric concentrations that is linked to 
increasing anthropogenic emissions (see Section 5.1.1.).   
 
Neither ambitious climate change policy nor air quality abatement policy can automatically yield co-benefits 
without integrated policies aimed at co-beneficial solutions (Zusman et al., 2013; Schmale et al., 2014b; 
Melamed et al., 2016), particularly in the energy generation and transport sectors (Rao et al., 2013; 
Thompson et al., 2016; Shindell et al., 2018; Vandyck et al., 2018). Integrated policies are necessary to yield 
multiple benefits of mitigating climate change, improving air quality, protecting human health, and achieving 
several Sustainable Development Goals. 
 
<boxref>Box 6.2</boxref> 
 
In summary, there is high confidence that effective decarbonization strategies could lead to air quality 
improvements but are not sufficient to achieve, in the near term, air quality WHO guideline values set for 
fine particulate matter), especially in parts of Asia and in some highly polluted regions. Additional policies 
(e.g., access to clean energy, waste management) envisaged to attain Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 
bring complementary SLCF reduction (high confidence). Sustained methane mitigation, wherever it occurs, 
stands out as an option that combines near and long-term gains on surface temperature (high confidence) and 
leads to air pollution benefit by reducing globally the surface ozone level (high confidence).

# 6.7  Future projections of Atmospheric Composition and Climate response in SSP scenarios 
 
This section assesses the 21st century projections of SLCF emissions, abundances, and responses in terms of 
climate and air quality following the  SSPs (Riahi et al., 2017; Gidden et al., 2019) (also see Chapter 1, 
Cross-Chapter Box 1.5, and Section 1.6.1.3). The future evolution of atmospheric abundances and the 
resulting climate and AQ responses is driven mainly by anthropogenic emissions and by natural emissions 
modulated by chemical, physical and biological processes as discussed in Sections 6.2 and 6.3. Like the RCP 
scenarios used in AR5, the SSP emission scenarios consider only direct anthropogenic (including biomass 
burning) emissions and do not project natural emission changes due to climate or land-use changes; ESMs 
intrinsically consider these biogeochemical feedbacks to varying degrees (Section 6.4.5). We rely on future 
projections based on CMIP6 ESMs with comprehensive representation of chemistry, aerosol microphysics, 
and biospheric processes that participated in the ScenarioMIP (O’Neill et al., 2016) and AerChemMIP 
(Collins et al., 2017). However, due to high computational costs of running coupled ESMs, they cannot be 
used for quantifying the contributions from individual species, regions and sectors and across the scenarios. 
Therefore, reduced complexity models (see Box 1.3 and Cross-Chapter Box 7.1), which represent chemistry 
and complex ESM interactions in parameterized forms updated since the AR5, are also applied here.   
 
 
## 6.7.1  Projections of Emissions and Atmospheric Abundances  
 
### 6.7.1.1  SLCF Emissions and atmospheric abundances 
 
The trajectory of future SLCF emissions is driven by the evolution of socioeconomic drivers described in 
1.6.1.1 but dedicated, SSP-specific, air pollution policy storylines can change the regional and global trends 
(Rao et al., 2017). Additionally, assumptions about urbanization (Jiang and O’Neill, 2017) will affect spatial 
distribution of emissions and consequently air quality. 

Growing urbanization worldwide has strongly modified the spatial distribution and intensity of SLCF 
emissions. The effect and extent of urbanization on air pollution and other emissions species are captured 
within Integrated Assessment Models (IAM) at varying levels of complexity. In most cases, models use a 
combination of proxies and assumptions of end-use efficiency and technological improvement assumptions 
to estimate emissions species arising from rural-to-urban migration and population growth within cities, 
utilizing quantifications of urbanization for the SSPs (Jiang and O’Neill, 2017). In addition, spatial patterns 
of future rural and urban population growth, migration, and decline have been quantified for the SSPs using 
a gravity model (Jiang and O’Neill, 2017). However, linking these spatial patterns with IAM regional 
emissions pathways is still an ongoing area of study and has not yet been represented in spatial emissions 
estimates provided by IAMs (Riahi et al., 2017; Gidden et al., 2019; Feng et al., 2020). As described in Feng 
et al. (2020), spatial emissions estimates derived for CMIP6 are largely a product of existing spatial patterns 
of population, but do not vary dynamically in future patterns. To the extend urbanization is accounted for in 
gridded emissions, IAM native region resolution (varying, for example, from 11 world regions to more than 
30, depending on the model) provides urbanization-based dynamics.  Despite the interest of studying the 
effect of well planned, densely populated urban centres, which can help to maximize the benefits of 
agglomeration, by providing proximity to infrastructure and services, opportunity for energy saving, and 
provide a frame for air quality control, IAM realizations of SSPs are not sufficient to assess this effect. The 
opportunities and risks associated with this rapid urbanization for SLCF emissions and air quality are 
analysed in the Chapter 6 of the WGII report and Chapter 8 of the WGIII report. 
 
All the RCP trajectories started in 2005 relying on the assumption that economic growth will bring rapid 
strengthening of air pollution legislation effectively reducing emissions of non-methane SLCFs (e.g., 
Chuwah et al., 2013). While in the long term such trends are expected if more ambitious air pollution control 
goes on par with the economic growth. The near term developments, however, might be much more diverse 
across the regions and species as has been observed in the last three decades (Amann et al., 2013; Rafaj et 
al., 2014; Rafaj and Amann, 2018; Ru et al., 2018), especially in several fast-growing economies, leading to 
the difference between CMIP6 historical estimates for the post 2000 period (Hoesly et al., 2018) and those 
used in RCPs (Figure 6.18). Since several SLCFs are also air pollutants, the narrow range of the RCP 
emissions trajectories in the future allowed for only limited analysis of near-future air quality (Amann et al., 
2013; Chuwah et al., 2013; Von Schneidemesser et al., 2015). However, the range of storylines in the SSPs 
lead to a wider range of assumed pollution control policies in the SSPs (Rao et al., 2017; Riahi et al., 2017). 
In SSP1 and SSP5, strong air quality policies are assumed to minimize adverse effects of pollution on 
population and ecosystems. In SSP2, a medium pollution control, with lower than current policy targets, is 
considered. Only weak, regionally varied, air pollution policies are applied in the SSP3 and SSP4. Additional 
climate policies introduced to reach defined radiative forcing targets will also affect SLCF emissions. The 
SSP SLCF emission trajectories (Rao et al., 2017; Gidden et al., 2019) assume a long term coupling of 
economic growth and specific emission indicators, such as, sectoral emission densities. The pace of change 
varies across regions and SSPs resulting in a wider range of future air pollutants evolution (Figure 6.18) 
reflecting the differences in assumed level of air pollution controls across the regions (Figure 6.19). At the 
end of the century, the SSP scenarios range is about four times that of RCP for SO₂ and NOx, two to four 
times for BC and NMVOC, and up to three times for CO and OC, while indicating slightly smaller range 
than RCPs for CH₄ (Figure 6.20). The originally developed SSP scenarios (Rao et al., 2017) have been 
harmonized with the CMIP6 historical emissions (Hoesly et al., 2018) and include updated SO₂ emissions to 
account for the recent decline in China (Gidden et al., 2019). 
 
All SSP scenarios (Figure 6.18), except SSP3-7.0, project decline in global total emissions for all SLCFs by 
the end of the 21st century, except for ammonia and for HFCs where Kigali Amendment is not included (see 
Section 6.6.3.2). Similar to RCPs, ammonia emissions continue to increase in most SSPs, except SSP1 and 
SSP2, accounting for the expected growth in food demand and a general lack of effective policies targeting 
agricultural emissions. Additionally, mitigation potential for NH<sub>3</sub> is generally smaller than for other species 
owing to fugitive and widely distributed sources (Pinder et al., 2006; Klimont and Winiwarter, 2015; 
Mohankumar Sajeev et al., 2018; Sajeev et al., 2018). Most significant changes of SLCF emissions in the 
near and long term compared to present day are expected for SO₂ owing to ever more stringent (and 
enforced) legislation in China’s power sector, extended recently to industrial sources (Zheng et al., 2018b; 
Tong et al., 2020), declining coal use in most SSPs, recently announced stricter emission limits for power 
sector in India, and reduction of sulphur content of oil fuel used in international shipping from 2020 (IMO, 
2016). For the lower forcing targets (e.g., SSP1-2.6), the SO₂ trajectories are similar to the RCPs resulting in 
over 50% to 90% decline by 2050 and 2100, respectively, while for the scenarios with no climate policies, 
the SSPs show large spread even at the end of the century. 
 
 
<figref>6.18</figref> 
 
<figref>6.19</figref> 
 
Until mid-century, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios project no reduction in NOx emissions at the global 
level with decline in most OECD countries and East Asia, driven by existing legislation in power, industry, 
and transportation, e.g., Tong et al. (2020), and continued increase in the rest of the world (Figure 6.18 and 
6.19). Towards the end of the century, similar trends continue in SSP3-7.0 while emissions in SSP5 decline 
strongly owing to faster technological progress and stronger air quality action (Rao et al., 2017; Riahi et al., 
2017). By 2100, the ‘Regional Rivalry’ (SSP3) scenario emissions of NOx (and most other SLCFs, except 
ammonia) are typically twice as high as next highest SSP projection, both at the global (Figure 6.18) and 
regional level (Figure 6.19). In emission pathways consistent with Paris Agreement goals, NOx drops, 
compared to 2015, by 50% in SSP1-2.6 and by 65% in SSP1-1.9 by 2050, and by 2100 is reduced by about 
70%, resulting in global emission levels comparable to 1950s and below the RCP range. Similar reductions 
are projected in climate mitigation pathways at the regional level, except Africa (less than 50% decline) due 
to high share of biomass emissions as well as strong growth in population and fossil fuel use. The trends in 
anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions for other ozone precursors (NMVOC, CO) are similar to that 
of NOx.  
 
An additional scenario, based on the SSP3-7.0, has been designed specifically to assess the effect of a strong 
SLCF emission abatement and is called SSP3-7.0-lowNTCF in the literature (Collins et al., 2017; Gidden et 
al., 2019). It has been applied in the modelling studies (e.g., AerChemMIP) with or without consideration of 
additional CH₄ reduction and we refer here to these scenarios, respectively, as SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF-lowCH₄ 
or SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF-highCH₄. In these scenarios, aerosols, their precursors, and non-methane tropospheric 
ozone precursors are mitigated by applying the same emission factors as in SSP1-1.9.  
 
For global methane emissions, the range is similar for SSPs and RCPs over the entire century (Figure 6.18), 
with highest projections in SSP3-7.0 (slightly below RCP8.5) estimating doubling of the current emissions 
and a reduction of about 75% by 2100 in scenarios consistent with 1.5-2°C targets; similar as in RCP2.6. At 
the regional level, the evolution of CH₄ emissions in climate mitigation scenarios is comparable to RCPs but 
there are significant differences for some regions with respect to high-emission scenarios. Especially, 
projection for East Asia differ significantly, the highest SSP3-7.0 is about half of the highest RCP by 2100 
(Figure 6.19) which is due to much lower projections of coal use in China driven largely by the last decade 
efforts to combat poor air quality. At the same time, the SSP scenarios without climate mitigation project 
faster growth in CH₄ emissions in Africa, Middle East, and Latin America (Figure 6.19) driven by 
developments in agriculture, oil and gas sectors, and, especially in Africa, waste management. There are 
significant differences in the assessment and feasibility of rapid CH₄ mitigation. Höglund-Isaksson et al. 
(2020) review most recent studies and assess feasibility of rapid widespread mitigation, concluding that 
significant (over 50%) reductions are attainable but feasibility of such reductions could be constrained in the 
short term due to locked capital. This might have implications for near term evolution assumed in, for 
example, SSP1-1.9 or SSP3-lowSLCF-lowCH₄, where emissions drop very quickly due to fast 
decarbonization and reductions in agriculture. Such high reduction potential in agriculture has been also 
assumed in other studies (Lucas et al., 2007; Harmsen et al., 2019) but is questioned by Höglund-Isaksson et 
al. (2020) who indicate that widespread implementation (within decades) of policies bringing about 
institutional and behavioural changes would be important for transition towards very low CH₄ emissions 
from livestock production. 
 
Global emissions of carbonaceous aerosols are projected to decline in all SSP scenarios (Figure 6.18) except 
SSP3-7.0. In that scenario, which also has much higher emissions than any of the RCPs, about half of the 
anthropogenic BC originates from cooking and heating on solid fuels, mostly in Asia and Africa (Figure 
6.19), where only limited progress in access to clean energy is achieved. Slow progress in improving waste 
management, high coal use in energy and industry, and no further progress in controlling diesel engines in 
Asia, Africa, and Latin America contributes most of the remaining emissions resulting in about 90% of 
anthropogenic BC emitted in non-OECD world by 2100 in SSP3-7.0. Similar picture emerges for OC but 
with larger importance of waste management sector and biomass burning and lower impact of transportation 
and industry developments. Since scenarios compliant with Paris Agreement goals (SSP1-1.9 or SSP1-2.6; 
see Section 1.6.1) include a widespread access to clean energy already by 2050, the global and regional 
emissions of BC decline by 70-75% by 2050 and 80% by 2100. The decline in residential sector (about 90% 
by 2050 and over 95% by 2100) is accompanied by a strong reduction in transport (over 98%) and 
decarbonization of industry and energy sector. About 50% of remaining BC emissions in SSP1-1.9 or SSP1-
2.6 is projected to originate from waste and open biomass burning of which open burning of residues 
represent a significant part. Some studies suggest this might be pessimistic as, for example, efficient waste 
management (consistent with SDG goals) could potentially eliminate open burning of solid waste (Gómez-
Sanabria et al., 2018), which accounts for over 30% of BC emissions in SSP1-1.9 in 2050 or 2100. 
 
The SSP scenarios draw on the HFCs projections developed by Velders et al. (2015) considering, in climate 
mitigation scenarios, the provisions of the Kigali Amendment (2016) to the Montreal Protocol leading to 
phasedown of HFCs (Papanastasiou et al., 2018) (see Section 6.6.3.2). The SSP scenarios without climate 
mitigation (e.g, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5) show a range of 3.2-5.3 Gt CO₂-eq yr-1 in 2050 and about 4-7.2 
Gt CO₂-eq yr-1 by 2100 while in deep climate mitigation scenarios (e.g., SSP1-1.9), consistent with the 1.5-
2°C targets, they are expected to drop to 0.1-0.3 and 0.1-0.35 GtCO₂-eq yr-1, respectively (Figure 6.19). In 
SSP1-1.9, the extent of reduction and its pace is more ambitious than current estimates of the effect of fully 
implemented and enforced Kigali Amendment (Figure 6.19) (Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2017; Purohit and 
Höglund-Isaksson, 2017). The best representation of the HFC emission trajectories in the SSP framework 
compliant with the Kigali Amendment is the SSP1-2.6 and the baseline (including only pre-Kigali national 
legislation; 6.6.3) is best represented by SSP5-8.5 (see Figure 6.19). However, since HFC emissions in SSPs 
were developed shortly after the Kigali Amendment had been agreed, none of these projections represents 
accurately the HFC emission trajectory corresponding to the phase-out emission levels agreed to in the 
Kigali Amendment (Meinshausen et al., 2020), leading to medium confidence in the assessment of the 
benefits of the Kigali Amendment when using SSP projections for HFCs.   
 
The SSP SLCF trajectories reflect the effect of recent legislation and assumed evolution thereof in the longer 
term, however, they do not necessarily reflect the full mitigation potential for several SLCFs, within 
particular SSPs (Figure 6.18), that could be achieved with air quality or SDG targeted policies (Amann et al., 
2013; Rogelj et al., 2014a; Haines et al., 2017b; Klimont et al., 2017c; Rafaj and Amann, 2018; Shindell et 
al., 2018; Tong et al., 2020). Such policies could bring more rapid mitigation of SLCFs, independent of the 
climate strategy (also see Section 6.6.3). 
 
The projections of future SLCF abundances typically follow their emissions trajectories except for SLCFs 
that are formed from precursor reactions (e.g., tropospheric ozone) or are influenced by biogeochemical 
feedbacks (See 6.2.2 and 6.4.5). According to multi-model CMIP6 simulations, total column ozone 
(reflecting mostly stratospheric ozone) is projected to return to 1960s values by the middle of the 21st 
century under the SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP4-3.4, SSP4-6.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios (Keeble et al., 2021). 
ESMs project increasing tropospheric ozone burden over the 2015-2100 period for the SSP3-7.0 scenario 
(Figure 6.4) (Griffiths et al., 2020), there is, however, a large spread in the magnitude of this increase 
reflecting structural uncertainties associated with the model representation of processes that influence 
tropospheric ozone. Sources of uncertainties in SLCF abundance projections include scenario uncertainties, 
or parametric and structural uncertainties in the model representation of the processes affecting simulated 
abundances with implications for radiative forcing and air quality. The evolution of methane abundances in 
SSP scenarios, for example, is derived from integrated assessment models (IAMs) which do not include the 
effects from biogeochemical feedbacks (e.g., climate-driven changes in wetland emissions) (Meinshausen et 
al., 2020) introducing uncertainty.  
 
In summary, in SSPs, in addition to the socio-economic development and climate mitigation policies shaping 
the GHG emission trajectories, the SLCF emission trajectories are also steered by varying levels of air 
pollution control originating from SSP narratives and independent from climate mitigation. Consequently, 
SSPs span a wider range of SLCF emissions than considered in the RCPs, better covering the diversity of 
future options in air pollution management and SLCF-induced climate effects (high confidence). In addition 
to SSP-driven emissions, the future evolution of SLCFs abundance is also sensitive to chemical and 
biogeochemical feedbacks involving SLCFs, particularly natural emissions, whose magnitude and sign are 
poorly constrained. 
 
 
### 6.7.1.2  Future evolution of surface ozone and PM concentrations  
 
The projection of air quality relevant abundances (surface ozone and PM2.5) under the SSP scenarios are 
assessed here. Future changes in global and regional annual mean surface ozone and PM2.5 driven by the 
evolution of emissions as well as climate change have been quantified by CMIP6 models analysed in 
AerChemMIP (Allen et al., 2020; Turnock et al., 2020; Allen et al., 2021).  
 
<figref>6.20</figref> 

Surface ozone increases continuously until 2050 across most regions in SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, (Turnock et 
al., 2020), particularly over Eastern Asia, Southern Asia, Middle East, Africa and South East Asia and 
developping Pacific where this increase can reach and even exceed 5ppb for annual mean averaged over land 
areas (Figure 6.20). After 2050, surface ozone concentrations decrease in SSP5-8.5, reaching levels below 
there 2005-2014 levels in most regions but and level off or continue to increase under SSP3-7.0.This 
increase in surface ozone in the SSP5-8.5 scenario occurs despite emissions decrease of several ozone 
precursors because of is due to CH₄ emissions increase until about 2080 in the absence of climate mitigation. 
Ozone decreases over all regions in response to strong emissions mitigation in SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 
(Turnock et al., 2020), with decreases of 5 to10 ppb as soon as 2030 in North America, Europe, Eurasia, 
Eastern Asia, Middle East and Southern Asia in their annual means over land areas . In most regions surface 
ozone is reduced slightly or remains near present day values in the middle of the road scenario, SSP2-4.5. In 
2100, the largest differences in surface ozone changes across the scenarios occur for the Middle East, 
Southern Asia and Eastern Asia with differences ranging up to 40 ppb between SSP3-7.0 and SSP1-1.9 at the 
end of the century. Despite discrepancies in the magnitude of changes, especially over North America, 
Europe, Eurasia, Eastern Asia and Southern Asia, the models are in high agreement regarding the signs of 
the changes with are thus assessed as of high confidence. 
 
The strong abatement of ozone precursor emissions (except those of CH₄) (SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF-highCH₄) 
lead to a decrease of global average surface ozone by 15% (6 ppb) between 2015 and 2055 (Allen et al., 
2020) and ozone decreases in all regions except Southern Asia. However, this decrease is two times larger 
when CH₄ emissions are abated simultaneously (SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF-lowCH₄), underlying the importance of 
methane emission reduction as an important lever to reduce ozone pollution (high confidence) (see also 
6.6.4).  
 
<figref>6.21</figref> 
 
A decrease in surface PM2.5 concentrations is estimated for SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5 (Turnock et 
al., 2020) (Figure 6.21). A decrease in PM2.5, is also projected in SSP5-8.5 which does not consider any 
climate mitigation but has a strong air pollution control. The decrease is largest in the regions with the 
highest 2005-2014 mean concentrations (Middle East, South Asia and East Asia). Under the SSP3-7.0 
scenario, PM2.5 is predicted to increase or remain at near present-day values across Asia; regions where 
present-day concentrations are currently the highest. There is large model spread over regions with large 
natural aerosol sources, for example, in North Africa, where dust sources are important. The mitigation of 
non-methane SLCFs in the SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF-highCH₄ scenario is predicted to reduce PM2.5 by 25% (in 
2055, relative to the SSP3-7.0 scenario) over global land surface areas (Allen et al., 2020). 
 
The magnitude of the annual mean change in surface ozone and PM2.5 for all the SSPs (accounting for both 
emission and climate change) is greater than that expected from climate change in isolation (Turnock et al., 
2020). The uncertainty in the projections comes from how natural emissions will respond to climate change. 
However, multiple lines of evidence (along with those from Sections 6.2.2, 6.5, and 6.7.1) provide high 
confidence (compared to medium in AR5) that changes in emissions, and in particular human-induced 
emissions, will drive future air pollution levels rather than physical climate change.  
 
In summary, future air pollution levels are strongly driven by precursor emission trajectories in the SSPs 
with substantial reductions in global surface ozone and PM (when air pollution and climate change are both 
strongly mitigated, e.g., SSP1-2.6) to no improvement and even degradation (when no climate change 
mitigation and only weak air pollution control are considered, SSP3-7.0) (high confidence). In the latter case, 
PM levels are estimated to increase until 2050 over large parts of Asia and surface ozone pollution worsens 
over all continental areas throughout the whole century (high confidence). In scenarios without climate 
change mitigation but with strong air pollution control (SSP5-8.5), high methane levels hamper the decline 
in global surface ozone in the near term and only PM levels decrease (high confidence). 
 
 
## 6.7.2  Evolution of future climate in response to SLCF emissions  
 
### 6.7.2.1  Effects of SLCFs on ERF and climate response  
 
This section assesses how the different spatial and temporal evolution of SLCF emissions in the SSPs affects 
the future global and regional ERFs, and GSAT and precipitation responses. In CMIP6, only a very limited 
set of simulations (all based on the SSP3-7.0 scenario) have been carried out with coupled ESMs to 
specifically address the future role of SLCFs (Collins et al., 2017), see also Sections 4.3 and 4.4. Note that 
the ScenarioMIP simulations (Section 4.3) include the SLCF emissions (as shown in Figures 6.18 and 6.19), 
however they cannot be used to quantify the effect of individual forcers. Coupled ESMs can in principle be 
used for this through a series of sensitivity simulations (e.g. Allen et al., 2020, 2021), but the amount of 
computer time required has made this approach prohibitive across the full SSP range. Therefore, to quantify 
the contribution from emissions of individual forcers spanning the range of the SSP scenarios to GSAT 
response, the analysis is mainly based on estimates using a two-layer emulator configuration derived from 
the medians of MAGICC7 and FaIRv1.6.2 (see Section 1.5.3.4, Cross Chapter Box 7.1, and Supplementary 
Material 7.SM5.2). The contribution from SLCFs to changes in GSAT have been calculated based on the 
global mean ERF for the various components as assessed in section 7.3.5, using the two-layer emulator for 
the climate response (Cross Chapter Box 7.1 and Supplementary Material 7.SM5.2).  
 
The projections of GSAT for a broad group of forcing agents (aerosols, methane, tropospheric ozone, and 
HFCs with lifetimes lower than 50 years) for the SSP scenarios shows how much of the future warming or 
cooling (relative to 2019) can be attributed to the SLCFs (Figure 6.22). Note that during the first two 
decades, some of these changes in GSAT are due to emissions before 2019, in particular for the longer lived 
SLCFs such as methane and HFCs (see also Figure 6.15). The scenarios SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF-highCH₄ and 
SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF-lowCH₄ are special cases of the SSP3-7.0 scenario with strong, but realistic, reductions 
in non-methane SLCFs and all SLCFs respectively (Gidden et al., 2019). 
 
As discussed in sections 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4, there are uncertainties relating emissions of SLCFs to changes in 
abundance (see Box 6.2) and further to ERF, in particular for aerosols and tropospheric ozone. Furthermore 
there are uncertainties related to the climate sensitivity, i.e., the relation between ERF and change in GSAT.  
Uncertainties in the ERF are assessed in Chapter 7 and calibrated impulse response function includes also the 
assessed range (see Box 7.1). There are also uncertainties related to the efficacies of the different SLCFs and 
time scales for the response, in particular for regional emissions (Schwarber et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019b) 
that cannot be accounted for with the simple models used here.  
 
<figref>6.22</figref>

Historical emissions have been updated until 2019 (see Supplementary Material of Chapter 7, 7.SM.1.3.1) 
and used for ERF for calculating GSAT in Figure 6.22. Year 2019 has been chosen as the base year to be 
consistent with the attributed temperature changes since 1750 (Figure 7.8). The warming attributed to SLCFs 
(methane, ozone and aerosols) over the last decade (Figure 7.8) constitutes about 30% of the peak SLCF 
driven warming in the most stringent scenarios (SSP1), in good agreement with Shindell and Smith (2019), 
and supported by the recent observed decline in AOD (Section 2.2.6).  
 
From 2019 and until about 2040, SLCFs and HFCs will contribute to increase GSAT in the WG1 core set of 
SSP scenarios, with a very likely range of 0.04-0.41°C relative to 2019. The warming is most pronounced in 
the strong mitigation scenarios (i.e., SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6) due to rapid cuts in aerosols. In the scenario 
SSP3-7.0, there is no reduction of aerosols until mid-century and it is the increases in methane and ozone 
that give a net warming in 2040. The warming is similar in magnitude to the SSP1-scenarios, in which the 
reduction in aerosols is the main driver. Contributions to warming from methane, ozone, aerosols and HFCs 
make SSP5-8.5 the scenario with the highest warming in 2040 and throughout the century.  
 
After about 2040, it is likely that across the scenarios the net effect of the removal of aerosols is a further 
increase in GSAT. However, their contribution to the rate of change decreases towards the end of the century 
(from up to 0.2°C per decade before 2040 to about 0.03 °C per decade). After 2040, the changes in methane, 
HFCs and tropospheric ozone become equally important as the changes in the aerosols for the GSAT trends. 
In the low emission scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6), the contribution to warming from the SLCFs peaks 
around 2040 with a very likely range of 0.04°C-0.34°C. After the peak, the reduced warming from reductions 
in methane and ozone dominates, giving a best total estimate warming induced by SLCF and HFC changes 
of 0.12°C and 0.14°C respectively, in 2100, with a very likely range of -0.07°C to + 0.45°C (Figure 6.22). 
However, in the longer term towards the end of the century there are very significant differences between the 
scenarios. In SSP3-7.0 there is a near linear warming due to SLCFs of 0.08°C per decade, while for SSP5-
8.5 there is a more rapid early warming. In SSP3-7.0, the limited reductions in aerosols, but a steady increase 
in methane, HFCs and ozone lead to a nearly linear contribution to GSAT reaching a best estimate of 0.5°C 
in 2100. Contributions from methane and ozone decrease towards 2100 in SSP5-8.5, however the warming 
from HFCs still increase and the SSP5-8.5 has the largest SLCF and HFC warming in 2100 with a best 
estimate of of 0.6°C. In the SSP2-4.5 scenario, a reduction in aerosols contributes to about 0.3°C warming in 
2100, while contributions from ozone and methane in this scenario are small. 
  
The simplified approach used to estimate the contributions to GSAT in Figure 6.22 have been supplemented 
with ESM simulations driven by the two versions of the SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF scenario (Section 6.7.1.1). 
Results from five CMIP6 ESMs with fully interactive atmospheric chemistry and aerosols for the high-
methane scenario show (Allen et al., 2020, 2021) that these reductions in emissions of air pollutants would 
lead to additional increase in GSAT by 2055 relative to 2015 compared to the standard SSP3-7.0 scenario, 
with a best estimate of 0.23 ± 0.05°C, and a corresponding increase in global mean precipitation of 1.3 ± 
0.17% (note that uncertainties from the work of Allen et al here and elsewhere are reported as twice standard 
deviation). Including methane mitigation (SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF-lowCH₄) would lead to a small increase in 
global precipitation (0.7 ± 0.1 %) by mid-century despite a decrease in GSAT (see 6.7.3), which is related to 
the higher sensitivity of precipitation to sulphate aerosols than greenhouse gases (Allen et al., 2021) (also see 
Section 8.2.1).  
 
Regionally inhomogeneous ERFs can lead to regionally dependent responses (see section 6.4.3). Mitigation 
of non-methane SLCFs over the period 2015 to 2055 (SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF-highCH₄ versus SSP3-7.0) will 
lead to positive ERF over land regions (Allen et al., 2020). There are large regional differences in the ERF 
from no significant trend over Northern Africa to about 0.5 W m-2 decade-1 for South Asia. The differences 
are mainly driven by differences in the reductions of sulphate aerosols. There is not a strong correspondence 
between regional warming and the ERF trends. As expected, the sensitivity (temperature change per unit 
ERF) increases towards higher latitudes due to climate feedbacks and teleconnections. Regionally, the 
warming rates are higher over continental regions, with highest increase in temperatures for Central and 
Northern Asia and the Arctic in 2055 relative to 2015. The models agree on increasing global mean trend in 
precipitation due to SLCFs, however precipitation trends over land are more uncertain (Allen et al., 2020), in 
agreement with the relationship between aerosol and precipitation trends assessed in Chapter 8. 
  
ESM estimates of future concentrations of various SLCFs vary considerably even when using the same 
future emission scenarios which is related to sources of model structural uncertainty in the several physical, 
chemical and natural emission model parameterisations. The general uncertainties in understanding and 
representing chemical and physical processes governing the life cycle of SLCFs (see Box 6.1) necessarily 
also applies to simulations of future concentrations and ERF. In addition, how the models are able to 
simulate climate changes (i.e., circulation and precipitation) that affects the dispersion and removal of 
SLCFs constitute a structural uncertainty in the models. Also SLCF related climate feedbacks (e.g., NOx 
from lightning or BVOCs from vegetation) (Section 6.4.5) add to the uncertainty.   
 
In the near term (2035-2040), it is unlikely that differences in the socio-economic developments (as 
embedded in the SSPs) can lead to a discernible difference in the net effect of changes of SLCFs on GSAT. 
This is because the intermodel spread in the estimated net effect of SLCFs on GSAT is as large as difference 
between the scenarios due to compensating effects of change in emissions leading to cooling and warming. 
However, in the longer term there is high confidence that the net warming of the SLCFs will be lower in the 
mitigation scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 that include reductions in methane emissions) than in the high-
emission scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5).  
 
 
### 6.7.2.2  Effect of regional emissions of SLCFs on GSAT 
 
For SLCFs with lifetimes shorter than typical mixing times in the atmosphere (days to weeks), the effects on 
secondary forcing agents (e.g. tropospheric ozone, sulphate and nitrate aerosols) depend on where and when 
the emissions occur due to non-linear chemical and physical processes. Also, the effective radiative forcing 
following a change in concentrations depends on the local conditions (see Sections 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4).  
While the emulators used for GSAT projections shown in figure 6.22 do not take the regional perspective 
into account, the set of simulations performed within the Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollutants phase two 
(HTAP2) project (Galmarini et al., 2017) allows for this perspective. The results from the chemistry-
transport model OsloCTM3 taking part in in HTAP-2 have been used by Lund et al. (2020) to derive 
regional specific absolute global warming potentials (AGTPs, cf. (Aamaas et al., 2016)) for each emitted 
SLCF and each HTAP-2 region. With this set of AGTPs Lund et al. (2020) estimate the transient response in 
GSAT to the regional anthropogenic emissions. There are important differences in the contributions to 
GSAT in 2040 and 2100 (relative to 2020) between the regions and scenarios mainly due to the differences 
in mixture of emitted SLCFs (Figure 6.23).  There is overall good agreement between the total net 
contribution from all regions to GSAT and the estimate based on global ERF and the two-layer emulator 
(Figure 6.22).  
 
In the low and medium emission scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5), the warming effects of the SLCFs on 
GSAT are dominated by emissions in North America, Europe, and East Asia (Figure 6.23). In SSP1-2.6 the 
emissions of all SLCFs in all regions decrease and the net effect of the changes in SLCFs from all of these 
three regions is an increase in GSAT of about 0.02°C (per region) in 2040 and about 0.04°C in 2100. For 
SSP2-4.5 emissions of most SLCFs continue to increase in South Asia (see Figure 6.19), leading to a net 
cooling in the near term (-0.03°C in 2040), while in 2100, North America, Europe, East and South Asia all 
contribute to a warming, most pronounced from East Asia (0.05°C). In the SSP3-7.0 scenario the net effect 
of SLCFs in all regions is an enhanced warming towards the end of the century. Methane then becomes the 
dominant SLCF, and Africa is the region contributing the most to predicted global warming in 2100 
(0.24°C). In SSP5-8.5, methane emissions increase in North America, Europe and Africa, while there is a 
decrease in the Asian regions. For North America and Europe, the methane increase combined with a 
reduction in aerosol leads to highest net contribution to GSAT in this scenario (0.06 and 0.04°C in 2100, 
respectively). The high growth in methane makes Africa the region with the largest contribution to future 
warming by SLCFs (0.18°C in 2100 versus 2020) in this scenario.

## 6.7.3  Effect of SLCFs mitigation in SSP scenarios 
 
Air quality policies lead to a decrease in emissions of both warming and cooling SLCFs. Here we assess the 
contribution of SLCFs to the total warming (including also the long-lived climate forcers) in the case of 
stringent SLCF mitigation to improve air quality in scenarios with continued high use of fossil fuels (e.g., 
SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF and SSP5-8.5). Conversely, we also assess the effect on air quality of strategies aiming 
to mitigate air pollution or climate change under the SSP3-7.0 framework (using the SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF-
lowCH₄, SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF-highCH₄ and SSP3-3.4 scenarios).  
 
As illustrated in Figure 6.24 (Section 6.7.2.2) and in Figure 2.2 of SR1.5 (Rogelj et al., 2018a), the total 
aerosol ERF change in stringent mitigation pathways is expected to be dominated by the effects from the 
phase-out of SO₂ contributing to a warming. Recent emission inventories and observations of trends in AOD 
(see Section 2.2.6 and 6.2.1) show that it is very likely that there have been reductions in global SO₂ 
emissions and in aerosol burdens over the last decade. Here, we use 2019 as the reference year rather than 
the ‘Recent Past’ defined as the average over 1995–2014 (Section 4.1) in order to exclude the recent 
emission reductions when discussing the different possible futures.  
 
The role of the different SLCFs, and also the net of all the SLCFs relative to the total warming in the 
scenarios, is quite different across the SSP scenarios varying with the summed levels of climate change 
mitigation and air pollution control (Figure 6.24). In the scenario without climate change mitigation but with 
strong air pollution control (SSP5-8.5) all the SLCFs (CH₄, aerosols, tropospheric O3) and the HFCs (with 
lifetimes less than 50 years) add to the warming, while in the strong climate change and air pollution 
mitigation scenarios (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6), the emission controls act to reduce methane, ozone and BC, 
and these reductions thus contribute to cooling.  In all scenarios, except SSP3-7.0, emission controls lead to a 
reduction of the aerosols relative to 2019, causing a warming. However, the warming from aerosol 
reductions is stronger in the SSP1 scenarios (with best estimates of 0.21°C in 2040 and 0.4°C in 2100 in 
SSP1-2.6) because of higher emission reductions from stronger decrease of fossil-fuel use in these scenario 
than in SSP5-8.5 (0.13°C in 2040 and 0.22°C in 2100). The changes in methane abundance contribute a 
warming of 0.14°C in SSP5-8.5, but a cooling of 0.14°C in SSP1-2.6 by the end of the 21st century relative 
to 2019. Furthermore, under SSP5-8.5, HFCs induce a warming of 0.06°C with a very likely range of [0.04 to 
0.08°C] in 2050 and 0.2 [0.1 to 0.3]°C by the end of the 21st century, relative to 2019, while under SSP1-
2.6, warming due to HFCs is negligible (below 0.02°C) (high confidence). This assessment relies on these 
estimates, which are based on updated ERFs and HFC lifetimes. It is in accordance with previous estimates 
(Section 6.6.3.2) of the efficiency of implementation of the Kigali Amendment and national regulations. It is 
very likely that under a stringent climate and air pollution mitigation scenario (SSP1-2.6), the warming 
induced by changes in methane, ozone, aerosols, and HFCs towards the end of 21st century, will be very low 
compared with the warming they would cause under SSP5-8.5 scenario (0.14 °C in SSP1-2.6 versus 0.62 °C 
in SSP5-8.5). 
 
For the SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF-highCH₄ and SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF-lowCH₄ scenarios, a five ESM ensemble has 
been analyzed relative to the standard SSP3-7.0 scenario (Allen et al., 2020, 2021). For SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF-
highCH₄, in which the methane emissions are as in the standard SSP3-7.0 scenario, (Allen et al., 2021) found 
an enhanced global mean surface warming of 0.23±0.05 °C by mid-century and 0.21±0.03 °C by 2100 
relative to the warming in the standard SSP3-7.0 scenario. Including also strong mitigation of methane 
emissions, the same models (Allen et al., 2021) find that the warming is off-set resulting in a net cooling of 
0.15±0.05 °C at mid-century (2050-2059) and 0.50±0.02 °C at the end of the century (2090-2099) relative to 
SSP3-7.0. 
 
There is robust evidence and high agreement that non-methane SLCFs mitigation measures, through 
reductions in aerosols and non-methane ozone precursors to improve air quality (SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF-
highCH₄ versus SSP3-7.0), would lead to additional near-term warming with a range of 0.1°C -0.3°C. 
Methane mitigation which also reduces tropospheric ozone, stands out as an option that combines near and 
long term gains on surface temperature (high confidence). With stringent but realistic methane mitigation 
(SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF-lowCH₄), it is very likely that warming (relative to SSP3-7.0) from non-methane SLCFs 
can be off-set (Figure 6.24 and Allen et al., 2021). Due to the slower response to the methane mitigation, this 
offset becomes more robust over time and it is very likely to be an offset after 2050. However, when 
comparing to present day, it is unlikely that that methane mitigation can fully cancel out the warming over 
the 21st century from reduction of non-methane cooling SLCFs. 
 
The SSP3 storyline assumes ‘regional rivalry’ (see 1.6.1.1) with weak air pollution legislation and no climate 
mitigation and is compared here against SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF-lowCH₄ (strong air pollution control) and 
SSP3-3.4 (the most ambitious climate policy feasible under SSP3 narrative). In the SSP3-3.4 scenario, all 
emissions follow the SSP3-7.0 scenario until about 2030 and then deep and rapid cuts in fossil fuel use are 
imposed (Fujimori et al., 2017). In the case of climate mitigation, such as in the SSP3-3.4 scenario, the 
decrease of SLCFs emissions is a co-benefit from the targeted decrease of CO₂ (when SLCFs are co-
emitted), but also directly targeted as in the case of methane. For SLCFs, this means that emissions of 
aerosols and methane increase until 2030 and are reduced fast thereafter (Fujimori et al., 2017). The effect on 
GSAT (relative to 2019) is shown in Figure 6.22 and 6.24. The net GSAT response to the SLCFs is 
dominated by the aerosols, with an initial cooling until 2030, then a fast rebound for 15 years followed by a 
very moderate warming reaching 0.21°C in 2100. The ozone change causes a slight cooling (up to 0.06°C), 
in contrast to the warming in the SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF-highCH₄ scenario in which the methane emissions 
increase until 2100.

To assess the effect of dedicated air quality versus climate policy on air quality, PM2.5 and ozone indicators 
were estimated for three SSP3 scenarios by applying a widely used approach for the analysis of air quality 
implications for given emission scenarios (Rao et al., 2017; Van Dingenen et al., 2018; Vandyck et al., 2018) 
and whose sensitivity of surface concentrations to emission changes is comparable to ESMs ensemble (see 
Supplementary Material 6.SM.5). The assessment shows that both strong air pollution control and strong 
climate mitigation, implemented independently, lead to large reduction of exposure to PM2.5 and ozone by 
the end of the century (Figures 6.25, 6.26) (high confidence). However, implementation of air pollution 
control, relying on the deployment of existing technologies, leads to benefits more rapidly than climate 
mitigation (high confidence), which requires systemic changes and is thus implemented later in this scenario. 
Notably, under the underlying SSP3 context, significant parts of the population remain exposed to air quality 
exceeding the WHO guidelines for PM2.5 over the whole century (high confidence), in particular in Africa, 
Eastern and Southern Asia, Middle East and for ozone only small improvement in population exposure is 
expected in Africa and Asia. Confidence levels here result from expert judgement on the whole chain of 
evidence.

In summary, the warming induced by SLCF changes is stable after 2040 in the WG1 core set of SSP 
scenarios associated with lower global air pollution as long as methane emissions are also mitigated, but the 
overall warming induced by SLCF changes is higher in scenarios in which air quality continues to deteriorate 
(caused by growing fossil fuel use and limited air pollution control) (high confidence). In the SSP3-7.0 
context, applying an additional strong air pollution control resulting in reductions in anthropogenic aerosols 
and non-methane ozone precursors would lead to an additional near-term global warming of 0.1°C with a 
very likely range of [-0.05 to 0.25]°C (compared with SSP3-7.0 for the same period). A simultaneous 
methane mitigation consistent with SSP1’s stringent climate mitigation policy implemented in the SSP3 
world, could entirely alleviate this warming and even lead to a cooling of 0.1°C with a very likely range of [-
0.1 to 0.20]°C (compared with SSP3-7.0 for the same period). Across the SSPs, the reduction of CH₄, ozone 
precursors and HFCs can make a 0.2°C [0.1–0.4]°C difference on GSAT in 2040 and a 0.8°C [0.5–1.3]°C 
difference at the end of the 21st century (Figure 6.24), which is substantial in the context of the 2015 Paris 
Agreement. Sustained methane mitigation, wherever it occurs, stands out as an option that combines near 
and long term gains on surface temperature (high confidence) and leads to air pollution benefit by reducing 
globally the surface ozone level (high confidence).  
 
Strong air pollution control as well as strong climate change mitigation, implemented independently, lead to 
large reduction of the exposure to air pollution by the end of the century (high confidence). Implementation 
of air pollution control, relying on the deployment of existing technologies, leads more rapidly to air quality 
benefits than climate change mitigation which requires systemic changes but, in both cases, significant parts 
of the population remain exposed to air pollution exceeding the WHO guidelines. 
 
 
# 6.8  Perspectives 
 
Ice-core analyses can now inform trends for more SLCFs over the last millennium (such as light NMVOCs 
or CO) and more proxies are available to inform about past emissions. However, preindustrial levels of 
SLCFs are still relatively poorly constrained. In addition, recent trends in abundances of the various types of 
aerosols and of NMVOCs suffer from the scarcity of observation networks in various parts of the world, in 
particular in the Southern Hemisphere. Such network development is necessary to record and understand the 
evolution of atmospheric composition.  
 
Assessment of the future air pollution changes at the urban level require the use of high resolution model to 
properly account for non-linearities in chemistry, specific urban structures, local meteorology as well as 
temporal and spatial variations in emissions and population exposure. To assess the relevance of air pollution 
reduction policies, regional air quality models are necessary and are still not implemented in many 
developing countries. To properly apply such models, the quality of spatialized emission inventories is 
essential, but the production of accurate emission inventories remain a challenge for lots of rapidly growing 
urban areas. The emission reporting now planned in the official mandate of the Task Force on National 
Greenhouse Gas Inventories (TFI) can be a step in this direction if accompanied by efforts on emission 
spatial distribution. An integrated modelling framework associating global and high-resolution chemistry-
transport models with shared protocols is missing to allow a systematic assessment of future changes on air 
quality at this scale.  
 
In parallel, opportunities of progress may emerge from big data acquisition. Big data and their mining can 
inform practices related to emissions or can document pollution levels if associated with massive deployment 
of low cost sensors through citizen science. New generation satellite data will as well give access to sub-km 
scale air pollution observations. 
 
A systematic emission modeling framework is needed to assess the LLGHG emission changes associated 
with SLCFs reductions induced by air pollution control in the SSP framework. The SLCF mediated effects 
of large-scale technology deployment to allow climate mitigation, such as hydrogen energy production, 
carbon capture and storage though amine filters or changes in agricultural practices to limit GHG emissions 
and/or produce bioenergy are also not considered in the emission scenarios.   
 
Since AR5, the complexity of ESMs has increased to include many chemical and biogeochemical processes. 
These lasts are necessary to quantify non-CO₂ biogeochemical feedbacks on the Earth System resulting from 
climate driven changes in atmospheric chemistry and SLCF emissions from natural systems and, in turn, 
impacts of SLCFs on biogeochemical cycles. Enhanced understanding of the biological, chemical and 
physical processes based on experimental and observational work has facilitated advances in the ESMs. 
However, assessment of non-CO₂ biogeochemical feedbacks and SLCF effects on land and aquatic 
ecosystem productivity still remains challenging due to the multiple complex processes involved and 
limitations in observational constraints to evaluate the skill of ESMs in realistically simulating the processes. 
Advances will come from better understanding of the processes and mechanisms, in particular at the 
component interfaces. The development of high resolution ESMs will facilitate their evaluation against high 
resolution observations.
