# 1.es Executive Summary 
 
Working Group I (WGI) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assesses the current 
evidence on the physical science of climate change, evaluating knowledge gained from observations, 
reanalyses, paleoclimate archives and climate model simulations, as well as physical, chemical and 
biological climate processes. This chapter sets the scene for the WGI assessment, placing it in the context of 
ongoing global and regional changes, international policy responses, the history of climate science and the 
evolution from previous IPCC assessments, including the Special Reports prepared as part of this 
Assessment Cycle. Key concepts and methods, relevant recent developments, and the modelling and scenario 
framework used in this assessment are presented.  
 
## Framing and Context of the WGI Report 
 
*The WGI contribution to the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) assesses new scientific evidence 
relevant for a world whose climate system is rapidly changing, overwhelmingly due to human 
influence.* The five IPCC assessment cycles since 1990 have comprehensively and consistently laid out the 
rapidly accumulating evidence of a changing climate system, with the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4, 
2007) being the first to conclude that warming of the climate system is unequivocal. Sustained changes have 
been documented in all major elements of the climate system, including the atmosphere, land, cryosphere, 
biosphere and ocean. Multiple lines of evidence indicate the unprecedented nature of recent large-scale 
climatic changes in context of all human history, and that they represent a millennial-scale commitment for 
the slow-responding elements of the climate system, resulting in continued worldwide loss of ice, increase in 
ocean heat content, sea level rise and deep ocean acidification. {1.2.1, 1.3, Box 1.2, Appendix 1.A} 
 
*Since the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), the international policy context of IPCC reports has 
changed.* The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 1992) has the overarching 
objective of preventing ‘dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system’. Responding to that 
objective, the Paris Agreement (2015) established the long-term goals of ‘holding the increase in global 
average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the 
temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels’ and of achieving ‘a balance between 
anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this 
century’. Parties to the Agreement have submitted Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) indicating 
their planned mitigation and adaptation strategies. However, the NDCs submitted as of 2020 are insufficient 
to reduce greenhouse gas emission enough to be consistent with trajectories limiting global warming to well 
below 2°C above pre-industrial levels (high confidence). {1.1, 1.2} 
 
*This report provides information of potential relevance to the 2023 global stocktake.* The 5-yearly 
stocktakes called for in the Paris Agreement will evaluate alignment among the Agreement’s long-term 
goals, its means of implementation and support, and evolving global efforts in climate change mitigation 
(efforts to limit climate change) and adaptation (efforts to adapt to changes that cannot be avoided). In this 
context, WGI assesses, among other topics, remaining cumulative carbon emission budgets for a range of 
global warming levels, effects of long-lived and short-lived climate forcers, projected changes in sea level 
and extreme events, and attribution to anthropogenic climate change. {Cross-Chapter Box 1.1} 
 
*Understanding of the fundamental features of the climate system is robust and well established.* 
Scientists in the 19th-century identified the major natural factors influencing the climate system. They also 
hypothesized the potential for anthropogenic climate change due to carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by fossil 
fuel combustion. The principal natural drivers of climate change, including changes in incoming solar 
radiation, volcanic activity, orbital cycles, and changes in global biogeochemical cycles, have been studied 
systematically since the early 20th century. Other major anthropogenic drivers, such as atmospheric aerosols 
(fine solid particles or liquid droplets), land-use change and non-CO2 greenhouse gases, were identified by 
the 1970s. Since systematic scientific assessments began in the 1970s, the influence of human activity on the 
warming of the climate system has evolved from theory to established fact. Past projections of global surface 
temperature and the pattern of warming are broadly consistent with subsequent observations (limited 
evidence, high agreement), especially when accounting for the difference in radiative forcing scenarios used 
for making projections and the radiative forcings that actually occurred. {1.3.1 - 1.3.6} 
 
*Global surface temperatures increased by about 0.1°C (likely range –0.1°C to +0.3°C, medium 
confidence) between the period around 1750 and the 1850–1900 period, with anthropogenic factors 
responsible for a warming of 0.0°C–0.2°C (likely range, medium confidence).* This assessed change in 
temperature before 1850–1900 is not included in the AR6 assessment of global warming to date, to ensure 
consistency with previous IPCC assessment reports, and because of the lower confidence in the estimate. 
There was likely a net anthropogenic forcing of 0.0–0.3 Wm-2 in 1850–1900 relative to 1750 (medium 
confidence), with radiative forcing from increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations being 
partially offset by anthropogenic aerosol emissions and land-use change. Net radiative forcing from solar and 
volcanic activity is estimated to be smaller than ±0.1 Wm-2 for the same period. {Cross Chapter Box 1.2, 
1.4.1, Cross Chapter Box 2.3} 
 
*Natural climate variability can temporarily obscure or intensify anthropogenic climate change on 
decadal time scales, especially in regions with large internal interannual-to-decadal variability. At the 
current level of global warming, an observed signal of temperature change relative to the 1850–1900 
baseline has emerged above the levels of background variability over virtually all land regions (high 
confidence).* Both the rate of long-term change and the amplitude of interannual (year-to-year) variability 
differ from global to regional to local scales, between regions and across climate variables, thus influencing 
when changes become apparent. Tropical regions have experienced less warming than most others, but also 
exhibit smaller interannual variations in temperature. Accordingly, the signal of change is more apparent in 
tropical regions than in regions with greater warming but larger interannual variations (high confidence). 
{1.4.2, FAQ1.2} 
 
*The AR6 has adopted a unified framework of climate risk, supported by an increased focus in WGI on 
low-likelihood, high-impact events.* Systematic risk framing is intended to aid the formulation of effective 
responses to the challenges posed by current and future climatic changes and to better inform risk assessment 
and decision-making. AR6 also makes use of the ‘storylines’ approach, which contributes to building a 
robust and comprehensive picture of climate information, allows a more flexible consideration and 
communication of risk, and can explicitly address low-likelihood, high-impact events. {1.1.2, 1.4.4, Cross-
Chapter Box 1.3} 
 
*The construction of climate change information and communication of scientific understanding are 
influenced by the values of the producers, the users and their broader audiences.* Scientific knowledge 
interacts with pre-existing conceptions of weather and climate, including values and beliefs stemming from 
ethnic or national identity, traditions, religion or lived relationships to land and sea (high confidence). 
Science has values of its own, including objectivity, openness and evidence-based thinking. Social values 
may guide certain choices made during the construction, assessment and communication of information 
(high confidence). {1.2.3, Box 1.1} 
 
## Data, Tools and Methods Used across the WGI Report 
 
*Capabilities for observing the physical climate system have continued to improve and expand overall, 
but some reductions in observational capacity are also evident (high confidence).* Improvements are 
particularly evident in ocean observing networks and remote-sensing systems, and in paleoclimate 
reconstructions from proxy archives. However, some climate-relevant observations have been interrupted by 
the discontinuation of surface stations and radiosonde launches, and delays in the digitisation of records. 
Further reductions are expected to result from the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, paleoclimate archives 
such as mid-latitude and tropical glaciers as well as modern natural archives used for calibration (e.g., corals 
and trees) are rapidly disappearing owing to a host of pressures, including increasing temperatures (high 
confidence). {1.5.1}    
 
*Reanalyses have improved since AR5 and are increasingly used as a line of evidence in assessments of 
the state and evolution of the climate system (high confidence).* Reanalyses, where atmosphere or ocean 
forecast models are constrained by historical observational data to create a climate record of the past, provide 
consistency across multiple physical quantities and information about variables and locations that are not 
directly observed. Since AR5, new reanalyses have been developed with various combinations of increased 
resolution, extended records, more consistent data assimilation, estimation of uncertainty arising from the 
range of initial conditions, and an improved representation of the ocean. While noting their remaining 
limitations, the WGI report uses the most recent generation of reanalysis products alongside more standard 
observation-based datasets. {1.5.2, Annex 1} 
 
*Since AR5, new techniques have provided greater confidence in attributing changes in climate 
extremes to climate change.* Attribution is the process of evaluating the relative contributions of multiple 
causal factors to an observed change or event. This includes the attribution of the causal factors of changes in 
physical or biogeochemical weather or climate variables (e.g., temperature or atmospheric CO2) as done in 
WGI, or of the impacts of these changes on natural and human systems (e.g., infrastructure damage or 
agricultural productivity), as done in WGII. Attributed causes include human activities (such as emissions of 
greenhouse gases and aerosols, or land-use change), and changes in other aspects of the climate, or natural or 
human systems. {Cross-WG Box 1.1} 
 
*The latest generation of complex climate models has an improved representation of physical processes, 
and a wider range of Earth system models now represent biogeochemical cycles. Since the AR5, 
higher-resolution models that better capture smaller-scale processes and extreme events have become 
available.* Key model intercomparisons supporting this assessment include the Coupled Model 
Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment 
(CORDEX), for global and regional models respectively. Results using CMIP Phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations 
are also assessed. Since the AR5, large ensemble simulations, where individual models perform multiple 
simulations with the same climate forcings, are increasingly used to inform understanding of the relative 
roles of internal variability and forced change in the climate system, especially on regional scales. The 
broader availability of ensemble model simulations has contributed to better estimations of uncertainty in 
projections of future change (high confidence). A broad set of simplified climate models is assessed and used 
as emulators to transfer climate information across research communities, such as for evaluating impacts or 
mitigation pathways consistent with certain levels of future warming. {1.4.2, 1.5.3, 1.5.4, Cross-chapter Box 
7.1}  
 
*Assessments of future climate change are integrated within and across the three IPCC Working 
Groups through the use of three core components: scenarios, global warming levels, and the 
relationship between cumulative carbon emissions and global warming.* Scenarios have a long history in 
the IPCC as a method for systematically examining possible futures. A new set of scenarios, derived from 
the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs), is used to synthesize knowledge across the physical sciences, 
impact, and adaptation and mitigation research. The core set of SSP scenarios used in the WGI report, SSP1-
1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, cover a broad range of emission pathways, including new 
low-emissions pathways. The feasibility or likelihood of individual scenarios is not part of this assessment, 
which focuses on the climate response to possible, prescribed emission futures. Levels of global surface 
temperature change (global warming levels), which are closely related to a range of hazards and regional 
climate impacts, also serve as reference points within and across IPCC Working Groups. Cumulative carbon 
emissions, which have a nearly linear relationship to increases in global surface temperature, are also used.

# 1.1  Report and chapter overview 
 
The role of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is to critically assess the scientific, 
technical, and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the physical science and impacts of 
human-induced climate change and natural variations, including the risks, opportunities and options for 
adaptation and mitigation. This task is performed through a comprehensive assessment of the scientific 
literature. The robustness of IPCC assessments stems from the systematic consideration and combination of 
multiple lines of independent evidence. In addition, IPCC reports undergo one of the most comprehensive, 
open, and transparent review and revision processes ever employed for science assessments. 
 
Starting with the First Assessment Report (FAR; IPCC, 1990) the IPCC assessments have been structured 
into three working groups. Working Group I (WGI) assesses the physical science basis of climate change, 
Working Group II (WGII) assesses associated impacts, vulnerability and adaptation options, and Working 
Group III (WGIII) assesses mitigation response options. Each report builds on the earlier comprehensive 
assessments by incorporating new research and updating previous findings. The volume of knowledge 
assessed and the cross-linkages between the three working groups have substantially increased over time.  
 
As part of its sixth assessment cycle, from 2015 to 2022, the IPCC is producing three Working Group 
Reports, three targeted Special Reports, a Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse 
Gas Inventories, and a Synthesis Report. The AR6 Special Reports covered the topics of ‘Global Warming of 
1.5°C’ (SR1.5; IPCC, 2018), ‘Climate Change and Land’ (SRCCL; IPCC, 2019a) and ‘The Ocean and 
Cryosphere in a Changing Climate’ (SROCC; IPCC, 2019b). The SR1.5 and SRCCL are the first IPCC 
reports jointly produced by all three Working Groups. This evolution towards a more integrated assessment 
reflects a broader understanding of the interconnectedness of the multiple dimensions of climate change.  
 
 
## 1.1.1  The AR6 WGI Report 
 
The Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the IPCC marks more than 30 years of global collaboration to 
describe and understand, through expert assessments, one of the defining challenges of the 21st century: 
human-induced climate change. Since the inception of the IPCC in 1988, our understanding of the physical 
science basis of climate change has advanced markedly. The amount and quality of instrumental 
observations and information from paleoclimate archives have substantially increased. Understanding of 
individual physical, chemical and biological processes has improved. Climate model capabilities have been 
enhanced, through the more realistic treatment of interactions among the components of the climate system, 
and improved representation of the physical processes, in line with the increased computational capacities of 
the world's supercomputers.  
 
This report assesses both observed changes, and the components of these changes that are attributable to 
anthropogenic influence (or human-induced), distinguishing between anthropogenic and naturally forced 
changes (see Section 1.2.1.1, Section 1.4.1, Cross Working Group Box: Attribution, and Chapter 3). The 
core assessment conclusions from previous IPCC reports are confirmed or strengthened in this report, 
indicating the robustness of our understanding of the primary causes and consequences of anthropogenic 
climate change.  
 
The WGI contribution to AR6 is focused on physical and biogeochemical climate science information, with 
particular emphasis on regional climate changes. These are relevant for mitigation, adaptation and risk 
assessment in the context of complex and evolving policy settings, including the Paris Agreement, the 
Global Stocktake, the Sendai Framework and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Framework.  
 
The core of this report consists of twelve chapters plus the Atlas (Figure 1.1), which can together be grouped 
into three categories (excluding this framing chapter): 
 
*Large-Scale Information (Chapters 2, 3 and 4).* These chapters assess climate information from global to 
continental or ocean-basin scales. Chapter 2 presents an assessment of the changing state of the climate 
system, including the atmosphere, biosphere, ocean and cryosphere. Chapter 3 continues with an assessment 
of the human influence on this changing climate, covering the attribution of observed changes, and 
introducing the fitness-for-purpose approach for the evaluation of climate models used to conduct the 
attribution studies. Finally, Chapter 4 assesses climate change projections, from the near to the long term, 
including climate change beyond 2100, as well as the potential for abrupt and ‘low-likelihood, high-impact’ 
changes. 
 
*Process Understanding (Chapters 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9).* These five chapters provide end-to-end assessments of 
fundamental Earth system processes and components: the carbon budget and biogeochemical cycles (Chapter 
5), short-lived climate forcers and their links to air quality (Chapter 6), the Earth’s energy budget and climate 
sensitivity (Chapter 7), the water cycle (Chapter 8), and the ocean, cryosphere and sea-level changes 
(Chapter 9). All these chapters provide assessments of observed changes, including relevant paleoclimatic 
information and understanding of processes and mechanisms as well as projections and model evaluation. 
 
*Regional Information (Chapters 10, 11, 12 and Atlas).* New knowledge on climate change at regional 
scales is reflected in this report with four chapters covering regional information. Chapter 10 provides a 
framework for assessment of regional climate information, including methods, physical processes, an 
assessment of observed changes at regional scales, and the performance of regional models. Chapter 11 
addresses extreme weather and climate events, including temperature, precipitation, flooding, droughts and 
compound events. Chapter 12 provides a comprehensive, region-specific assessment of changing climatic 
conditions that may be hazardous or favourable (hence influencing climate risk) for various sectors to be 
assessed in WGII. Lastly, the Atlas assesses and synthesizes regional climate information from the whole 
report, focussing on the assessments of mean changes in different regions and on model assessments for the 
regions. It also introduces the online Interactive Atlas, a novel compendium of global and regional climate 
change observations and projections. It includes a visualization tool combining various warming levels and 
scenarios on multiple scales of space and time. 
 
Embedded in the chapters are *Cross-Chapter Boxes* that highlight cross-cutting issues. Each chapter also 
includes an *Executive Summary (ES)*, and several *Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)*. To enhance 
traceability and reproducibility of report figures and tables, detailed information on the input data used to 
create them, as well as links to archived code, are provided in the *Input Data Tables* in chapter 
Supplementary Material. Additional metadata on the model input datasets is provided via the report website.  
 
The AR6 WGI report includes a *Summary for Policy Makers (SPM)* and a *Technical Summary (TS)*. The 
integration among the three IPCC Working Groups is strengthened by the implementation of the *Cross-
Working-Group Glossary*.

## 1.1.2  Rationale for the new AR6 WGI structure and its relation to the previous AR5 WGI Report 
 
The AR6 WGI report, as a result of its scoping process, is structured around topics such as large-scale 
information, process understanding and regional information (Figure 1.1). This represents a rearrangement 
relative to the structure of the WGI contribution to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5; IPCC, 2013a), 
as summarized in Figure 1.2. The AR6 approach aims at a greater visibility of key knowledge developments 
potentially relevant for policymakers, including climate change mitigation, regional adaptation planning 
based on a risk management framework, and the Global Stocktake.  
 

<figref>1.2</figref>

 
Two key subjects presented separately in AR5, paleoclimate and model evaluation, are now distributed 
among multiple AR6 WGI chapters. Various other cross-cutting themes are also distributed throughout this 
report. A summary of these themes and their integration across chapters is described in Table 1.1.  
 
<tableref>1.1</tableref>


 
## 1.1.3 Integration of AR6 WGI assessments with other Working Groups 

 
Integration of assessments across the chapters of the WGI Report, and with WGII and WGIII, occurs in a 
number of ways, including work on a common Glossary, risk framework (see Cross-Chapter Box 1.3), 
scenarios and projections of future large-scale changes, and the presentation of results at various global 
warming levels (see Section 1.6).  
 
Chapters 8 through 12, and the Atlas, cover topics also assessed by WGII in several areas, including regional 
climate information and climate-related risks. This approach produces a more integrated assessment of 
impacts of climate change across Working Groups. In particular, Chapter 10 discusses the generation of 
regional climate information for users, the co-design of research with users, and the translation of 
information into the user context (in particular directed towards WGII). Chapter 12 provides a direct bridge 
between physical climate information (climatic impact-drivers) and sectoral impacts and risk, following the 
chapter organization of the WGII assessment. Notably, Cross-Chapter Box 12.1 draws a connection to 
representative key risks and Reasons for Concern (RFC).  
 
The science assessed in Chapters 2 to 7, such as the carbon budget, short-lived climate forcers and emission 
metrics, are topics in common with WGIII, and relevant for the mitigation of climate change. This includes a 
consistent presentation of the concepts of carbon budget and net zero emission targets within chapters, in 
order to support integration in the Synthesis Report. Emission-driven emulators (simple climate models), 
summarised in Cross-Chapter Box 7.1 in Chapter 7 are used to approximate large-scale climate responses of 
complex Earth System Models (ESMs) and have been used as tools to explore the expected GSAT response 
to multiple scenarios consistent with those assessed in WGI for the classification of scenarios in WGIII. 
Chapter 6 provides information about the impact of climate change on global air pollution, relevant for 
WGII, including Cross-Chapter Box 6.1 on the implications of the recent coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) 
for climate and air quality. Cross-Chapter Box 2.3 in Chapter 2 presents an integrated cross-WG discussion 
of global temperature definitions, with implications for many aspects of climate change science.  
 
In addition, Chapter 1 sets out a shared terminology on cross-cutting topics, including climate risk, 
attribution and storylines, as well as an introduction to emission scenarios, global warming levels and 
cumulative carbon emissions as an overarching topic for integration across all three Working Groups.  
 
All these integration efforts are aimed at enhancing the bridges and ‘handshakes’ among Working Groups, 
enabling the final cross-working group exercise of producing the integrated Synthesis Report.  
 
 

## 1.1.4  Chapter preview 
 
The main purposes of this chapter are: (1) to set the scene for the WGI assessment and to place it in the 
context of ongoing global changes, international policy processes, the history of climate science and the 
evolution from previous IPCC assessments, including the Special Reports prepared as part of the sixth 
assessment cycle; (2) to describe key concepts and methods, relevant developments since AR5, and the 
modelling framework used in this assessment; and (3) together with the other chapters of this report, to 
provide context and support for the WGII and WGIII contributions to AR6, particularly on climate 
information to support mitigation, adaptation and risk management. 
 
The chapter comprises seven sections (Figure 1.3). Section 1.2 describes the present state of Earth’s climate, 
in the context of reconstructed and observed long-term changes and variations caused by natural and 
anthropogenic factors. It also provides context for the present assessment by describing recent changes in 
international climate change governance and fundamental scientific values. The evolution of knowledge 
about climate change and the development of earlier IPCC assessments are presented in Section 1.3. 
Approaches, methods, and key concepts of this assessment are introduced in Section 1.4. New developments 
in observing networks, reanalyses, modelling capabilities and techniques since the AR5 are discussed in 
Section 1.5. The three main ‘dimensions of integration’ across Working Groups in the AR6, i.e. emission 
scenarios, global warming levels and cumulative carbon emissions, are described in Section 1.6. The Chapter 
closes with a discussion of opportunities and gaps in knowledge integration in Section 1.7.

# 1.2  Where we are now 
 
The IPCC sixth assessment cycle occurs in the context of increasingly apparent climatic changes observed 
across the physical climate system. Many of these changes can be attributed to anthropogenic influences, 
with impacts on natural and human systems. AR6 also occurs in the context of efforts in international climate 
governance such as the Paris Agreement, which sets a long-term goal to hold the increase in global average 
temperature to ‘well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature 
increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and 
impacts of climate change’. This section summarises key elements of the broader context surrounding the 
assessments made in the present report.  
 
 
## 1.2.1  The changing state of the physical climate system 
 
The WGI contribution to the AR5 (AR5 WGI; IPCC, 2013a) assessed that ‘warming of the climate system is 
unequivocal’, and that since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to 
millennia. Changes are evident in all components of the climate system: the atmosphere and the ocean have 
warmed, amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, the ocean has acidified and its 
oxygen content has declined, and atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased (IPCC, 
2013b). This Report documents that, since the AR5, changes to the state of the physical and biogeochemical 
climate system have continued, and these are assessed in full in later chapters. Here, we summarize changes 
to a set of key large-scale climate indicators over the modern era (1850 to present). We also discuss the 
changes in relation to the longer-term evolution of the climate. These ongoing changes throughout the 
climate system form a key part of the context of the present report.  
 

### 1.2.1.1  Recent changes in multiple climate indicators 
 
The physical climate system comprises all processes that combine to form weather and climate. The early 
chapters of this report broadly organize their assessments according to overarching realms: the atmosphere, 
the biosphere, the cryosphere (surface areas covered by frozen water, such as glaciers and ice sheets), and the 
ocean. Elsewhere in the report, and in previous IPCC assessments, the land is also used as an integrating 
realm that includes parts of the biosphere and the cryosphere. These overarching realms have been studied 
and measured in increasing detail by scientists, institutions, and the general public since the 18th century, 
over the era of instrumental observation (see Section 1.3). Today, observations include those taken by 
numerous land surface stations, ocean surface measurements from ships and buoys, underwater 
instrumentation, satellite and surface-based remote sensing, and in situ atmospheric measurements from 
airplanes and balloons. These instrumental observations are combined with paleoclimate reconstructions and 
historical documentations to produce a highly detailed picture of the past and present state of the whole 
climate system, and to allow assessments about rates of change across the different realms (see Chapter 2 
and Section 1.5). 
 
Figure 1.4 documents that the climate system is undergoing a comprehensive set of changes. It shows a 
selection of key indicators of change through the instrumental era that are assessed and presented in the 
subsequent chapters of this report. Annual mean values are shown as stripes, with colours indicating their 
value. The transitions from one colour to another over time illustrate how conditions are shifting in all 
components of the climate system. For these particular indicators, the observed changes go beyond the 
yearly and decadal variability of the climate system. In this Report, this is termed an ‘emergence’ of the 
climate signal (see Section 1.4.2 and FAQ 1.2). 
 
Warming of the climate system is most commonly presented through the observed increase in global mean 
surface temperature (GMST). Taking a baseline of 1850–1900, GMST change until present (2011–2020) is 
1.09 °C (0.95–1.20 °C) (see Chapter 2, Section 2.3, Cross-Chapter Box 2.3). This evolving change has been 
documented in previous Assessment Reports, with each reporting a higher total global temperature change 
(see Section 1.3, Cross-Chapter Box 1.2). The total change in Global Surface Air Temperature (GSAT; see 
Section 1.4.1 and Cross-Chapter Box 2.3 in Chapter 2) attributable to anthropogenic activities is assessed to 
be consistent with the observed change in GSAT (see Chapter 3, Section 3.3)<ref>1</ref>. 
 
Similarly, atmospheric concentrations of a range of greenhouse gases are increasing. Carbon dioxide (CO2, 
shown in Figure 1.4 and Figure 1.5a), found in AR5 and earlier reports to be the current strongest driver of 
anthropogenic climate change, has increased from 285.5 ± 2.1 ppm in 1850 to 409.9 ± 0.4 ppm in 2019; 
concentrations of methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) have increased as well (see Chapter 2, Sections 
2.2, Chapter 5, section 5.2, and Annex V). These observed changes are assessed to be in line with known 
anthropogenic and natural emissions, when accounting for observed and inferred uptake by land, ocean, and 
biosphere respectively (see Chapter 5, Section 5.2), and are a key source of anthropogenic changes to the 
global energy balance (or radiative forcing; see Chapter 2, Section 2.2 and Chapter 7, Section 7.3).  
 
The hydrological (or water) cycle is also changing and is assessed to be intensifying, through a higher 
exchange of water between the surface and the atmosphere (see Chapter 3, Section 2.3 and Chapter 8, 
Section 8.3). The resulting regional patterns of changes to precipitation are, however, different from surface 
temperature change, and interannual variability is larger, as illustrated in Figure 1.4. Annual land area mean 
precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere temperate regions has increased, while the sub-tropical dry regions 
have experienced a decrease in precipitation in recent decades (see Chapter 2, Section 2.3). 
 
The cryosphere is undergoing rapid changes, with increased melting and loss of frozen water mass in most 
regions. This includes all frozen parts of the globe, such as terrestrial snow, permafrost, sea ice, glaciers, 
freshwater ice, solid precipitation, and the ice sheets covering Greenland and Antarctica (see Chapter 9; 
SROCC, IPCC, 2019b). Figure 1.4 illustrates how, globally, glaciers have been increasingly losing mass for 
the last fifty years. The total glacier mass in the most recent decade (2010-2019) was the lowest since the 
beginning of the 20th century. (See Chapter 2, Section 2.3 and Chapter 9, Section 9.5). 
 
The global ocean has warmed unabatedly since at least 1970 (Sections 1.3, 2.3, 9.2; SROCC, IPCC, 2019b) . 
Figure 1.4 shows how the averaged ocean heat content is steadily increasing, with a total increase of [0.28–
0.55] yottajoule (1024 joule) between 1971 and 2018. (see Chapter 9, Section 9.2). In response to this ocean 
warming, as well as to the loss of mass from glaciers and ice sheets, the global mean sea level (GMSL) has 
risen by 0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] metres between 1900 and 2018. GMSL rise has accelerated since the late 1960s. 
(See Chapter 9, Section 9.6).  
 
Overall, the changes in these selected climatic indicators have progressed beyond the range of natural year-
to-year variability (see Chapters 2, 3, 8, and 9, and further discussion in Sections 1.2.1.2 and 1.4.2). The 
indicators presented in Figure 1.4 document a broad set of concurrent and emerging changes across the 
physical climate system. All indicators shown here, along with many others, are further presented in the 
coming chapters, together with a rigorous assessment of the supporting scientific literature. Later chapters 
(Chapter 10, 11, 12, and the Atlas) present similar assessments at the regional level, where observed changes 
do not always align with the global mean picture shown here.

### 1.2.1.2  Long-term perspectives on anthropogenic climate change  
 
Paleoclimate archives (e.g, ice cores, corals, marine and lake sediments, speleothems, tree rings, borehole 
temperatures, soils) permit the reconstruction of climatic conditions before the instrumental era. This 
establishes an essential long-term context for the climate change of the past 150 years and the projected 
changes in the 21st century and beyond (IPCC, 2013a; Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013) Chapter 3). Figure 1.5 
shows reconstructions of three key indicators of climate change over the past 800,000 years<ref>2</ref> – atmospheric 
CO2 concentrations, global mean surface temperature (GMST) and global mean sea level (GMSL) – 
comprising at least eight complete glacial-interglacial cycles (EPICA Community Members, 2004; Jouzel et 
al., 2007)  that are largely driven by oscillations in the Earth’s orbit and consequent feedbacks on multi-
millennial time scales (Berger, 1978; Laskar et al., 1993). The dominant cycles – recurring approximately 
every 100,000 years – can be found imprinted in the natural variations of these three key indicators. Before 
industrialisation, atmospheric CO2 concentrations varied between 174 ppm and 300 ppm, as measured 
directly in air trapped in ice at Dome Concordia, Antarctica (Bereiter et al., 2015; Nehrbass-Ahles et al., 
2020). Relative to 1850–1900, the reconstructed GMST changed in the range of -6 to +1°C across these 
glacial-interglacial cycles (see Chapter 2, Section 2.3.1 for an assessment of different paleo reference 
periods). GMSL varied between about -130 m during the coldest glacial maxima and +5 to +25 m during the 
warmest interglacial periods (Spratt and Lisiecki, 2016; Chapter 2). They represent the amplitudes of natural, 
global-scale climate variations over the last 800,000 years prior to the influence of human activity. Further 
climate information from a variety of paleoclimatic archives are assessed in Chapters 2, 5, 7, 9.  
 
Paleoclimatic information also provides a long-term perspective on rates of change of these three key 
indicators. The rate of increase in atmospheric CO2 observed over 1919-2019 CE is one order of magnitude 
higher than the fastest CO2 fluctuations documented during the last glacial maximum and the last deglacial 
transition in high-resolution reconstructions from polar ice cores (Marcott et al., 2014, see Chapter 2, Section 
2.2.3.2.1). Current multi-decadal GMST exhibit a higher rate of increase than over the past two thousand 
years (PAGES 2k Consortium, 2019; Chapter 2, Section 2.3.1.1.2), and in the 20th century GMSL rise was 
faster than during any other century over the past three thousand years (Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3.3). 
 
<figref>1.5</figref>

Paleoclimate reconstructions also shed light on the causes of these variations, revealing processes that need 
to be considered when projecting climate change. The paleorecords show that sustained changes in global 
mean temperature of a few degrees Celsius are associated with increases in sea level of several tens of metres 
(Figure 1.5). During two extended warm periods (interglacials) of the last 800,000 years, sea level is 
estimated to have been at least six metres higher than today (Chapter 2; Dutton et al., 2015). During the last 
interglacial, sustained warmer temperatures in Greenland preceded the peak of sea level rise (Figure 5.15 in 
Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013). The paleoclimate record therefore provides substantial evidence directly 
linking warmer GMST to substantially higher GMSL. 
 
GMST will remain above present-day levels for many centuries even if net CO2 emissions are reduced to 
zero, as shown in simulations with coupled climate models (Plattner et al., 2008; Section 12.5.3 in Collins et 
al., 2013; Zickfeld et al., 2013; MacDougall et al., 2020; Chapter 4, Section 4.7.1). Such persistent warm 
conditions in the atmosphere represent a multi-century commitment to long-term sea level rise, summer sea 
ice reduction in the Arctic, substantial ice sheet melting, potential ice sheet collapse, and many other 
consequences in all components of the climate system (Clark et al., 2016; Pfister and Stocker, 2016; Fischer 
et al., 2018; see also Chapter 9, Section 9.4) (Figure 1.5). 
 
Paleoclimate records also show centennial- to millennial-scale variations, particularly during the ice ages, 
which indicate rapid or abrupt changes of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC; see 
Chapter 9, Section 9.2.3.1) and the occurrence of a ‘bipolar seesaw’ (opposite-phase surface temperature 
changes in both hemispheres; Stocker and Johnsen, 2003; EPICA Community Members, 2006; Members 
WAIS Divide Project et al., 2015; Lynch-Stieglitz, 2017; Pedro et al., 2018; Weijer et al., 2019, see Chapter 
2, Section 2.3.3.4.1). This process suggests that instabilities and irreversible changes could be triggered if 
critical thresholds are passed (Section 1.4.4.3). Several other processes involving instabilities are identified 
in climate models (Drijfhout et al., 2015), some of which may now be close to critical thresholds (Joughin et 
al., 2014; Section 1.4.4.3; see also Chapters 5, 8 and 9 regarding tipping points). 
 
Based on Figure 1.5, the reconstructed, observed and projected ranges of changes in the three key indicators 
can be compared. By the first decade of the 20th century, atmospheric CO2 concentrations had already 
moved outside the reconstructed range of natural variation over the past 800,000 years. On the other hand, 
global mean surface temperature and sea level were higher than today during several interglacials of that 
period (Chapter 2, Section 2.3.1, Figure 2.34 and Section 2.3.3). Projections for the end of the 21st century, 
however, show that GMST will have moved outside of its natural range within the next few decades, except 
for the strong mitigation scenarios (Section 1.6). There is a risk that GMSL may potentially leave the 
reconstructed range of natural variations over the next few millennia (Clark et al., 2016; Chapter 9, Section 
9.6.3.5; SROCC (IPCC, 2019b). In addition, abrupt changes can not be excluded (Section 1.4.4.3). 
 
An important time period in the assessment of anthropogenic climate change is the last 2000 years. Since 
AR5, new global datasets have emerged, aggregating local and regional paleorecords (PAGES 2k 
Consortium, 2013, 2017, 2019; McGregor et al., 2015; Tierney et al., 2015; Abram et al., 2016; Hakim et al., 
2016; Steiger et al., 2018; Brönnimann et al., 2019b). Before the global warming that began around the mid-
19th century (Abram et al., 2016), a slow cooling in the Northern Hemisphere from roughly 1450 to 1850 is 
consistently recorded in paleoclimate archives (PAGES 2k Consortium, 2013; McGregor et al., 2015). While 
this cooling, primarily driven by an increased number of volcanic eruptions (PAGES 2k Consortium, 2013; 
Owens et al., 2017; Brönnimann et al., 2019b; Chapter 3, Section 3.3.1), shows regional differences, the 
subsequent warming over the past 150 years exhibits a global coherence that is unprecedented in the last 
2000 years (Neukom et al., 2019).  
 
The rate, scale, and magnitude of anthropogenic changes in the climate system since the mid-20th century 
suggested the definition of a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene (Crutzen and Stoermer, 2000; Steffen 
et al., 2007), referring to an era in which human activity is altering major components of the Earth system 
and leaving measurable imprints that will remain in the permanent geological record (IPCC, 2018) (Figure 
1.5). These alterations include not only climate change itself, but also chemical and biological changes in the 
Earth system such as rapid ocean acidification due to uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide, massive 
destruction of tropical forests, a worldwide loss of biodiversity and the sixth mass extinction of species 
(Hoegh-Guldberg and Bruno, 2010; Ceballos et al., 2017; IPBES, 2019). According to the key messages of 
the last global assessment of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem 
Services (IPBES, 2019), climate change is a ‘direct driver that is increasingly exacerbating the impact of 
other drivers on nature and human well-being’, and ‘the adverse impacts of climate change on biodiversity 
are projected to increase with increasing warming’. 
 
 
## 1.2.2  The policy and governance context 
 
The contexts of both policymaking and societal understanding about climate change have evolved since the 
AR5 was published (2013–2014). Increasing recognition of the urgency of the climate change threat, along 
with still-rising emissions and unresolved issues of mitigation and adaptation, including aspects of 
sustainable development, poverty eradication and equity, have led to new policy efforts. This section 
summarizes these contextual developments and how they have shaped, and been used during the preparation 
of this Report. 
 
*IPCC reports and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).* The IPCC First 
Assessment Report (FAR, IPCC, 1990a) provided the scientific background for the establishment of the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 1992), which committed parties to 
negotiate ways to ‘prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system’ (the ultimate 
objective of the UNFCCC). The Second Assessment Report (SAR, IPCC, 1995a) informed governments in 
negotiating the Kyoto Protocol (1997), the first major agreement focusing on mitigation under the UNFCCC. 
The Third Assessment report (TAR, IPCC, 2001a) highlighted the impacts of climate change and need for 
adaptation and introduced the treatment of new topics such as policy and governance in IPCC reports. The 
Fourth and Fifth Assessment Reports (AR4, IPCC, 2007a; AR5, IPCC, 2013a) provided the scientific 
background for the second major agreement under the UNFCCC: the Paris Agreement (2015), which entered 
into force in 2016.   
 
*The Paris Agreement (PA).* Parties to the PA commit to the goal of limiting global average temperature 
increase to ‘well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature 
increase to 1.5°C in order to ‘significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change’. In AR6, as in 
many previous IPCC reports, observations and projections of changes in global temperature are expressed 
relative to 1850-1900 as an approximation for pre-industrial levels (Cross-Chapter Box 1.2). 
 
The PA further addresses mitigation (Article 4) and adaptation to climate change (Article 7), as well as loss 
and damage (Article 8), through the mechanisms of finance (Article 9), technology development and transfer 
(Article 10), capacity-building (Article 11) and education (Article 12). To reach its long-term temperature 
goal, the PA recommends ‘achieving a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals 
by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century’, a state commonly described as ‘net zero’ 
emissions (Article 4) (Section 6, Box 1.4). Each Party to the PA is required to submit a Nationally 
Determined Contribution (NDC) and pursue, on a voluntary basis, domestic mitigation measures with the 
aim of achieving the objectives of its NDC (Article 4).  
 
Numerous studies of the NDCs submitted since adoption of the PA in 2015 (Fawcett et al., 2015; UNFCCC, 
2015, 2016; Lomborg, 2016; Rogelj et al., 2016, 2017; Benveniste et al., 2018; Gütschow et al., 2018; 
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), 2019) conclude that they are insufficient to meet the Paris 
temperature goal. In the present IPCC Sixth Assessment cycle, a Special Report on Global Warming of 
1.5°C (SR1.5, IPCC, 2018) assessed high agreement that current NDCs ‘are not in line with pathways that 
limit warming to 1.5°C by the end of the century’. The PA includes a ratcheting mechanism designed to 
increase the ambition of voluntary national pledges over time. Under this mechanism, NDCs will be 
communicated or updated every five years. Each successive NDC will represent a ‘progression beyond’ the 
‘then current’ NDC and reflect the ‘highest possible ambition’ (Article 4). These updates will be informed by 
a five-yearly periodic review including the ‘Structured Expert Dialogue’ (SED), as well as a ‘global 
stocktake’, to assess collective progress toward achieving the PA long-term goals. These processes will rely 
upon the assessments prepared during the IPCC sixth assessment cycle (e.g., Schleussner et al., 2016b; 
Cross-Chapter Box 1.1). 
 
*The Structured Expert Dialogue (SED).*  Since AR5, the formal dialogue between the scientific and policy 
communities has been strengthened through a new science-policy interface, the Structured Expert Dialogue 
(SED). The SED was established by UNFCCC to support the work of its two subsidiary bodies, the 
Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and the Subsidiary Body for 
Implementation (SBI). The first SED aimed to ‘ensure the scientific integrity of the first periodic review’ of 
the UNFCCC, the 2013-2015 review. The Mandate of the periodic review is to ‘assess the adequacy of the 
long-term (temperature) goal in light of the ultimate objective of the convention’ and the ‘overall progress 
made towards achieving the long-term global goal, including a consideration of the implementation of the 
commitments under the Convention'. 
 
The SED of the first periodic review (2013-2015) provided an important opportunity for face-to-face 
dialogue between decision makers and experts on review themes, based on ‘the best available scientific 
knowledge, including the assessment reports of the IPCC’. That SED was instrumental in informing the 
long-term global goal of the PA and in providing the scientific argument of the consideration of limiting 
warming to 1.5°C warming (Fischlin et al., 2015; Fischlin, 2017). The SED of the second periodic review, 
initiated in the second half of 2020, focuses on, inter alia, ‘enhancing Parties’ understanding of the long-term 
global goal and the scenarios towards achieving it in the light of the ultimate objective of the Convention’. 
The second SED provides a formal venue for the scientific and the policy communities to discuss the 
requirements and benchmarks to achieve the ‘long-term temperature goal’ (LTTG) of 1.5°C and well below 
2°C global warming. The discussions also concern the associated timing of net zero emissions targets and the 
different interpretations of the PA LTTG, including the possibility of overshooting the 1.5° C warming level 
before returning to it by means of negative emissions (e.g., Schleussner and Fyson, 2020; Section 1.6). The 
second periodic review is planned to continue until November 2022 and its focus includes the review of the 
progress made since the first review, with minimising ‘possible overlaps’ and profiting from ‘synergies with 
the Global Stocktake’. 
 
<boxref>Cross-Chapter Box 1.1</boxref> 
 
*Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).* Many interactions among environmental problems and 
development are addressed in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 
Sustainable Development Goals. The 2030 Agenda, supported by the finance-oriented Addis Ababa Action 
Agenda (UN DESA, 2015), calls on nations to ‘take the bold and transformative steps which are urgently 
needed to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path.’ The 2030 Agenda recognizes that ‘climate 
change is one of the greatest challenges of our time and its adverse impacts undermine the ability of all 
countries to achieve sustainable development.’ SDG 13 deals explicitly with climate change, establishing 
several targets for adaptation, awareness-raising and finance. Climate and climate change are also highly 
relevant to most other SDGs, while acknowledging UNFCCC as the main forum to negotiate the global 
response to climate change. For example, both long-lived greenhouse gases (LLGHGs), through mitigation 
decisions, and SLCFs, through air quality, are relevant to SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). 
Chapter 6 assesses SLCF effects on climate and the implications of changing climate for air quality, 
including opportunities for mitigation relevant to the SDGs (Chapter 6, Box 6.2). Also, the UN Conference 
on Housing and Sustainable Development established a New Urban Agenda (United Nations, 2017) 
envisaging cities as part of the solutions for sustainable development, climate change adaptation and 
mitigation.  
 
*The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR).* The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk 
Reduction is a non-binding agreement to reduce risks associated with disasters of all scales, frequencies and 
onset rates caused by natural or human-made hazards, including climate change. The SFDRR outlines targets 
and priorities for action including ‘Understanding disaster risk’, along the dimensions of vulnerability, 
exposure of persons and assets and hazard characteristics. Chapter 12 assesses climate information relevant 
to regional impact and risk assessment with a focus on climate hazards and other aspects of climate that 
influence society and ecosystem and makes the link with Working Group II. AR6 adopts a consistent risk 
and solution-oriented framing (Cross-Chapter Box 1.3) that calls for a multidisciplinary approach and cross-
working group coordination in order to ensure integrative discussions of major scientific issues associated 
with integrative risk management and sustainable solutions (IPCC, 2017).  
 
*The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).* 
Efforts to address climate change take place alongside and in the context of other major environmental 
problems, such as biodiversity loss. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and 
Ecosystem Services (IPBES), established in 2012, builds on the IPCC model of a science-policy interface 
and assessment. The Platform's objective is to ‘strengthen the science-policy interface for biodiversity and 
ecosystem services for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, long-term human well-being and 
sustainable development’ (UNEP, 2012). SROCC (IPCC, 2019b) and SRCCL (IPCC, 2019a) assessed the 
relations between changes in biodiversity and in the climate system. The rolling work programme of IPBES 
up to 2030 will address interlinkages among biodiversity, water, food and health. This assessment will use a 
nexus approach to examine interlinkages between biodiversity and the above-mentioned issues, including 
climate change mitigation and adaptation. Furthermore, IPBES and IPCC will directly collaborate on 
biodiversity and climate change under the rolling work programme.  
 
Addressing climate change alongside other environmental problems, while simultaneously supporting 
sustainable socioeconomic development, requires a holistic approach. Since AR5, there is increasing 
attention on the need for coordination among previously independent international agendas, recognizing that 
climate change, disaster risk, economic development, biodiversity conservation and human well-being are 
tightly interconnected. The current COVID-19 pandemic provides an example of the need for such 
interconnection, with its widespread impacts on economy, society and environment (e.g., Shan et al., 2020). 
Cross Chapter Box 6.1 in Chapter 6 assesses the consequences of the COVID-19 lockdowns on emissions of 
GHGs and SLCFs and related implications for the climate. Another example is the close link between SLCF 
emissions, climate evolution and air quality concerns (see Chapter 6). Emissions of halocarbons have 
previously been successfully regulated under the Montreal Protocol and its Kigali Amendment. This has 
been achieved in an effort to reduce ozone depletion that has also modulated anthropogenic climate influence 
(Estrada et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2013). In the process, emissions of some SLCFs are jointly regulated to 
reduce environmental and health impacts from air pollution (e.g., Gothenburg Protocol; Reis et al., 2012). 
Considering the recognized importance of SLCFs for climate, the IPCC decided in May 2019 to approve that 
the IPCC Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories produces an IPCC Methodology Report on 
SLCFs to develop guidance for national SLCFs inventories. 
 
The evolving governance context since AR5 challenges the IPCC to provide policymakers and other actors 
with information relevant for both adaptation to and mitigation of climate change and for the loss and 
damage induced.  
 
 
## 1.2.3  Linking science and society: communication, values, and the IPCC assessment process  
 
This section assesses how the process of communicating climate information has evolved since AR5. It 
summarizes key issues regarding scientific uncertainty addressed in previous IPCC assessments and 
introduces the IPCC calibrated uncertainty language. Next it discusses the role of values in problem-driven, 
multidisciplinary science assessments such as this one. The section introduces climate services and how 
climate information can be tailored for greatest utility in specific contexts, such as the global stocktake. 
Finally, we briefly evaluate changes in media coverage of climate information since AR5, including the 
increasing role of internet sources and social media. 
 
 
### 1.2.3.1  Climate change understanding, communication, and uncertainties 
 
The response to climate change is facilitated when leaders, policymakers, resource managers, and their 
constituencies share basic understanding of the causes, effects, and possible future course of climate change 
(SR1.5, IPCC, 2018; SRCCL, IPCC, 2019a). Achieving shared understanding is complicated, since scientific 
knowledge interacts with pre-existing conceptions of weather and climate built up in diverse world cultures 
over centuries and often embedded in strongly held values and beliefs stemming from ethnic or national 
identities, traditions, religion, and lived relationships to weather, land and sea (Van Asselt and Rotmans, 
1996; Rayner and Malone, 1998; Hulme, 2009, 2018; Green et al., 2010; Jasanoff, 2010; Orlove et al., 2010; 
Nakashima et al., 2012; Shepherd and Sobel, 2020). These diverse, more local understandings can both 
contrast with and enrich the planetary-scale analyses of global climate science (high confidence). 
 
Political cultures also give rise to variation in how climate science knowledge is interpreted, used, and 
challenged (Leiserowitz, 2006; Oreskes and Conway, 2010; Brulle et al., 2012; Dunlap and Jacques, 2013; 
Mahony, 2014, 2015; Brulle, 2019). A meta-analysis of 87 studies carried out between 1998 and 2016 (62 
USA national, 16 non-USA national, 9 cross-national) found that political orientation and political party 
identification were the second-most important predictors of views on climate change after environmental 
values (the strongest predictor) (McCright et al. 2016). Ruiz et al. (2020) systematically reviewed 34 studies 
of non-US nations or clusters of nations and 30 studies of the USA alone. They found that in the non-US 
studies, ‘changed weather’ and ‘socio-altruistic values’ were the most important drivers of public attitudes. 
For the USA case, by contrast, political affiliation and the influence of corporations were most important. 
Widely varying media treatment of climate issues also affects public responses (see Section 1.2.3.4). In 
summary, environmental and socio-altruistic values are the most significant influences on public opinion 
about climate change globally, while political views, political party affiliation, and corporate influence also 
had strong effects, especially in the USA (high confidence).  
 
Furthermore, climate change itself is not uniform. Some regions face steady, readily observable change, 
while others experience high variability that masks underlying trends (Section 1.4.1); most regions are 
subject to hazards, but some may also experience benefits, at least temporarily (see Chapters 11, 12, and 
Atlas). This non-uniformity may lead to wide variation in public climate change awareness and risk 
perceptions at multiple scales (Howe et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2015). For example, short-term temperature 
trends, such as cold spells or warm days, have been shown to influence public concern (Hamilton and 
Stampone, 2013; Zaval et al., 2014; Bohr, 2017). 
 
Given these manifold influences and the highly varied contexts of climate change communication, special 
care is required when expressing findings and uncertainties, including  IPCC assessments that inform 
decision making. Throughout the IPCC’s history, all three Working Groups (WGs) have sought to explicitly 
assess and communicate scientific uncertainty (Le Treut et al., 2007; Cubasch et al., 2013). Over time, the 
IPCC has developed and revised a framework to treat uncertainties consistently across assessment cycles, 
reports, and Working Groups through the use of calibrated language (Moss and Schneider, 2000; IPCC, 
2005). Since its First Assessment Report (IPCC, 1990a), the IPCC specified terms and methods for 
communicating authors’ expert judgments (Mastrandrea and Mach, 2011). During the AR5 cycle, this 
calibrated uncertainty language was updated and unified across all WGs (Mastrandrea et al., 2010, 2011). 
Box 1.1 summarizes this framework as used in AR6. 
 
<boxref>Box 1.1</boxref>
 
Considerable critical attention has focused on whether applying the IPCC framework effectively achieves 
consistent treatment of uncertainties and clear communication of findings to users (Shapiro et al., 2010; 
Adler and Hirsch Hadorn, 2014). Specific concerns include, for example, the transparency and traceability of 
expert judgements underlying the assessment conclusions (Oppenheimer et al., 2016) and the context-
dependent representations and interpretations of probability terms (Budescu et al., 2009, 2012; Janzwood, 
2020). Budescu et al. (2014) surveyed 25 samples in 24 countries (a total of 10,792 individual responses), 
finding that even when shown IPCC uncertainty guidance, lay readers systematically misunderstood IPCC 
likelihood statements. When presented with a ‘high likelihood’ statement, they understood it as indicating a 
lower likelihood than intended by the IPCC authors. Conversely, they interpreted ‘low likelihood’ statements 
as indicating a higher likelihood than intended. In another study, British lay readers interpreted uncertainty 
language somewhat differently from IPCC guidance, but Chinese lay people reading the same uncertainty 
language translated into Chinese differed much more in their interpretations (Harris et al., 2013). Further, 
even though it is objectively more probable that wide uncertainty intervals will encompass true values, wide 
intervals were interpreted by lay people as implying subjective uncertainty or lack of knowledge on the part 
of scientists (Løhre et al., 2019). Mach et al. (2017) investigated the advances and challenges in approaches 
to expert judgment in the AR5. Their analysis showed that the shared framework increased the overall 
comparability of assessment conclusions across all WGs and topics related to climate change, from the 
physical science basis to resulting impacts, risks, and options for response. Nevertheless, many challenges in 
developing and communicating assessment conclusions persist, especially for findings drawn from multiple 
disciplines and Working Groups, for subjective aspects of judgments, and for findings with substantial 
uncertainties (Adler and Hirsch Hadorn, 2014). In summary, the calibrated language cannot entirely prevent 
misunderstandings, including a tendency to systematically underestimate the probability of the IPCC’s 
higher-likelihood conclusions and overestimate the probability of the lower-likelihood ones (high 
confidence), however a consistent and systematic approach across Working Groups to communicate the 
assessment outcomes is an important characteristic of the IPCC.  
 
Some suggested alternatives are impractical, such as always including numerical values along with calibrated 
language (Budescu et al., 2014). Others, such as using positive instead of negative expressions of low to 
medium probabilities, show promise but were not proposed in time for adoption in AR6 (Juanchich et al., 
2020). This report therefore retains the same calibrated language used in AR5 (Box 1.1). Like previous 
reports, AR6 also includes FAQs that express its chief conclusions in plain language designed for lay 
readers. 
 
The framework for communicating uncertainties does not  address when "deep uncertainty" is identified in 
the assessment (Adler and Hirsch Hadorn, 2014). The definition of deep uncertainty in IPCC assessments 
has been described in the context of the SROCC (IPCC, 2019b; Box 5 in Abram et al. (2019)). A situation of 
deep uncertainty exists when experts or stakeholders do not know or cannot agree on: (1) appropriate 
conceptual models that describe relationships among key driving forces in a system; (2) the probability 
distributions used to represent uncertainty about key variables and parameters; and/or (3) how to weigh and 
value desirable alternative outcomes (Abram et al., 2019). (See also Cross-Chapter Box 1.2, Annex VII 
Glossary) Since AR5, the ‘storylines’ or ‘narratives’ approach has been used to address issues related to deep 
uncertainty, for example low-likelihood events that would have high impact if they occurred, to better inform 
risk assessment and decision making (see Section 1.4.4). Chapter 9 (Section 9.2.3) notes deep uncertainty in 
long term projections for sea level rise, and in processes related to Marine Ice Sheet Instability and Marine 
Ice Cliff Instability.  
 
 
### 1.2.3.2  Values, science, and climate change communication  
 
As noted above, values — fundamental attitudes about what is important, good, and right — play critical 
roles in all human endeavours, including climate science. In AR5, Chapters 3 and 4 of the WGIII assessment 
addressed the role of cultural, social, and ethical values in climate change mitigation and sustainable 
development (Fleurbaey et al., 2014; Kolstad et al., 2014). These values include widely accepted concepts of 
human rights, enshrined in international law, that are relevant to climate impacts and policy objectives (Hall 
and Weiss, 2012; Peel and Osofsky, 2018; Setzer and Vanhala, 2019). Specific values – human life, 
subsistence, stability, and equitable distribution of the costs and benefits of climate impacts and policies – 
are explicit in the texts of the UNFCCC and the PA (Breakey et al., 2016; Dooley and Parihar, 2016). Here 
we address the role of values in how scientific knowledge is created, verified, and communicated. Chapters 
10, 12, and Cross-Chapter Box 12.2 address how the specific values and contexts of users can be addressed 
in the co-production of climate information. 
 
The epistemic (knowledge-related) values of science include explanatory power, predictive accuracy, 
falsifiability, replicability, and justification of claims by explicit reasoning (Popper, 1959; Kuhn, 1977). 
These are supported by key institutional values, including openness, ‘organized scepticism,’ and objectivity 
or ‘disinterestedness’ (Merton, 1973), operationalized as well-defined methods, documented evidence, 
publication, peer review, and systems for institutional review of research ethics (COSEPUP, 2009). In recent 
decades, open data, open code, and scientific cyberinfrastructure (notably the Earth System Grid Federation, 
a partnership of climate modeling centers dedicated to supporting climate research by providing secure, web-
based, distributed access to climate model data) have facilitated scrutiny from a larger range of participants, 
and FAIR data stewardship principles – making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable 
(FAIR) – are being mainstreamed in many fields (Wilkinson et al., 2016). Climate science norms and 
practices embodying these scientific values and principles include the publication of data and model code, 
multiple groups independently analysing the same problems and data, model intercomparison projects 
(MIPs), explicit evaluations of uncertainty, and comprehensive assessments by national academies of science 
and the IPCC. 
 
The formal Principles Governing IPCC Work (1998, amended 2003, 2006, 2012, 2013) specify that 
assessments should be ‘comprehensive, objective, open and transparent.’ The IPCC assessment process 
seeks to achieve these goals in several ways: by evaluating evidence and agreement across all relevant peer-
reviewed literature, especially that published or accepted since the previous assessment; by maintaining a 
traceable, transparent process that documents the reasoning, data, and tools used in the assessment; and by 
maximizing the diversity of participants, authors, experts, reviewers, institutions, and communities 
represented, across scientific discipline, geographical location, gender, ethnicity, nationality, and other 
characteristics. The multi-stage review process is critical to ensure an objective, comprehensive and robust 
assessment, with hundreds of scientists, other experts, and governments providing comments to a series of 
drafts before the report is finalised.  
 
Social values are implicit in many choices made during the construction, assessment, and communication of 
climate science information (Heymann et al., 2017; Skelton et al., 2017). Some climate science questions are 
prioritised for investigation, or given a specific framing or context, because of their relevance to climate 
policy and governance. One example is the question of how the effects of a 1.5°C global warming would 
differ from those of a 2°C warming, an assessment specifically requested by Parties to the PA. SR1.5 (2018) 
explicitly addressed this issue ‘within the context of sustainable development; considerations of ethics, 
equity and human rights; and the problem of poverty’ (Chapters 1 and 5; see also Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 
2019) following the outcome of the approval of the outline of the Special Report by the IPCC during its 44th 
Session (Bangkok, Thailand, 17-20 October 2016). Likewise, particular metrics are sometimes prioritized in 
climate model improvement efforts because of their practical relevance for specific economic sectors or 
stakeholders. Examples include reliable simulation of precipitation in a specific region, or attribution of 
particular extreme weather events to inform rebuilding and future policy (see Chapters 8 and 11; Intemann, 
2015; Otto et al., 2018; James et al., 2019). Sectors or groups whose interests do not influence research and 
modelling priorities may thus receive less information in support of their climate-related decisions (Parker 
and Winsberg, 2018).  
 
Recent work also recognizes that choices made throughout the research process can affect the relative 
likelihood of false alarms (overestimating the probability and/or magnitude of hazards) or missed warnings 
(underestimating the probability and/or magnitude of hazards), known respectively as Type I and Type II 
errors. Researchers may choose different methods depending on which type of error they view as most 
important to avoid, a choice that may reflect social values (Douglas, 2009; Knutti, 2018; Lloyd and Oreskes, 
2018). This reflects a fundamental trade-off between the values of reliability and informativeness. When 
uncertainty is large, researchers may choose to report a wide range as ‘very likely’, even though it is less 
informative about potential consequences. By contrast, high-likelihood statements about a narrower range 
may be more informative, yet also prove less reliable if new evidence later emerges that widens the range. 
Furthermore, the difference between narrower and wider uncertainty intervals has been shown to be 
confusing to lay readers, who often interpret wider intervals as less certain (Løhre et al., 2019).  
 
 
### 1.2.3.3  Climate information, co-production, and climate services 
 
In AR6, ‘climate information’ refers to specific information about the past, current, or future state of the 
climate system that is relevant for mitigation, adaptation and risk management. Cross-Chapter Box 1.1 is an 
example of climate information at the global scale. It provides climate change information potentially 
relevant to the global stocktake, and indicates where in AR6 this information may be found.  
 
Responding to national and regional policymakers' needs for tailored information relevant to risk assessment 
and adaptation, AR6 emphasizes assessment of regional information more than earlier reports. Here the 
phrase ‘regional climate information’ refers to predefined reference sets of land and ocean regions; various 
typological domains (such as mountains or monsoons); temporal frames including baseline periods as well as 
near-term (2021–2040), medium-term (2041–2060), and long-term (2081–2100); and global warming levels 
(Sections 1.4.1 and 1.4.5; Chapters 10, 12, and Atlas). Regional climate change information is constructed 
from multiple lines of evidence including observations, paleoclimate proxies, reanalyses, attribution of 
changes and climate model projections from both global and regional climate models (Section 1.5.3, Chapter 
10, Section 10.2 to 10.4). The constructed regional information needs to take account of user context and 
values for risk assessment, adaptation and policy decisions (Section 1.2.3, Chapter 10, Section 10.5). 
 
As detailed in Chapter 10, scientific climate information often requires ‘tailoring’ to meet the requirements 
of specific decision-making contexts. In a study of the UK Climate Projections 2009 project, researchers 
concluded that climate scientists struggled to grasp and respond to users’ information needs because they 
lacked experience interacting with users, institutions, and scientific idioms outside the climate science 
domain (Porter and Dessai, 2017). Economic theory predicts the value of ‘polycentric’ approaches to climate 
change informed by specific global, regional, and local knowledge and experience (Ostrom, 1996, 2012). 
This is confirmed by numerous case studies of extended, iterative dialogue among scientists, policymakers, 
resource managers, and other stakeholders to produce mutually understandable, usable, task-related 
information and knowledge, policymaking and resource management around the world (Lemos and 
Morehouse, 2005; Lemos et al., 2012, 2014, 2018; see Vaughan and Dessai, 2014 for a critical view). SR1.5 
(2018) assessed that ‘education, information, and community approaches, including those that are informed 
by indigenous knowledge and local knowledge, can accelerate the wide-scale behaviour changes consistent 
with adapting to and limiting global warming to 1.5°C. These approaches are more effective when combined 
with other policies and tailored to the motivations, capabilities and resources of specific actors and contexts 
(high confidence).’ These extended dialogic ‘co-production’ and education processes have thus been 
demonstrated to improve the quality of both scientific information and governance (high confidence) 
(Chapter 10, Section 10.5; Cross Chapter Box 12.2 in Chapter 12).  
 
Since AR5, ‘climate services’ have increased at multiple levels (local, national, regional, and global) to aid 
decision-making of individuals and organizations and to enable preparedness and early climate change 
action. These services include appropriate engagement from users and providers, are based on scientifically 
credible information and producer and user expertise, have an effective access mechanism, and respond to 
the users’ needs (Hewitt et al., 2012; Annex VII Glossary). A Global Framework for Climate Services 
(GFCS) was established in 2009 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in support of these 
efforts (Hewitt et al., 2012; Lúcio and Grasso, 2016). Climate services are provided across sectors and 
timescales, from sub-seasonal to multi-decadal and support co-design and co-production processes that 
involve climate information providers, resource managers, planners, practitioners and decision makers 
(Brasseur and Gallardo, 2016; Trenberth et al., 2016; Hewitt et al., 2017). For example, they may provide 
high-quality data on temperature, rainfall, wind, soil moisture and ocean conditions, as well as maps, risk 
and vulnerability analyses, assessments, and future projections and scenarios. These data and information 
products may be combined with non-meteorological data, such as agricultural production, health trends, 
population distributions in high-risk areas, road and infrastructure maps for the delivery of goods, and other 
socio-economic variables, depending on users’ needs (WMO, 2020a). Cross-chapter Box 12.2 in Chapter 12 
illustrates the diversity of climate services with three examples from very different contexts.  
 
The current landscape of climate services is assessed in detail in Chapter 12 (Section 12.6), with a focus on 
multi-decadal timescales relevant for climate change risk assessment. Other information relevant to 
improving climate services for decision making includes the assessment of methods to construct regional 
information (Chapter 10), as well as projections at the regional level (Atlas) relevant for impact and risk 
assessment in different sectors (Chapter 12). 
 
 
### 1.2.3.4  Media coverage of climate change 
 
Climate services focus on users with specific needs for climate information, but most people learn about 
climate science findings from media coverage. Since AR5, research has expanded on how mass media report 
climate change and how their audiences respond (Dewulf, 2013; Jaspal and Nerlich, 2014; Jaspal et al., 
2014). For example, in five European Union (EU) countries, television coverage of the AR5 used ‘disaster’ 
and ‘opportunity’ as its principal themes, but virtually ignored the ‘risk’ framing introduced by AR5 WGII 
(Painter, 2015) and now extended by the AR6 (see Cross-Chapter Box 1.3). Other studies show that people 
react differently to climate change news when it is framed as a catastrophe (Hine et al., 2015), as associated 
with local identities (Sapiains et al., 2016), or as a social justice issue (Howell, 2013). Similarly, audience 
segmentation studies show that responses to climate change vary between groups of people with different, 
although not necessarily opposed, views on this phenomenon (e.g., Maibach et al., 2011; Sherley et al., 2014; 
Detenber et al., 2016). In Brazil, two studies have shown the influence of mass media on the high level of 
public climate change concern in that country (Rodas and DiGiulio, 2017; Dayrell, 2019). In the USA, 
analyses of television network news show that climate change receives minimal attention, is most often 
framed in a political context, and largely fails to link extreme weather events to climate change using 
appropriate probability framing (Hassol et al., 2016). However, recent evidence suggests that Climate 
Matters (an Internet resource for US TV weathercasters to link weather to climate change trends) may have 
had a positive effect on public understanding of climate change (Myers et al., 2020). Also, some media 
outlets have recently adopted and promoted terms and phrases stronger than the more neutral ‘climate 
change’ and ‘global warming’, including ‘climate crisis’, ‘global heating’, and ‘climate emergency’ (Zeldin-
O’Neill, 2019). Google searches on those terms, and on ‘climate action,’ increased 20-fold in 2019, when 
large social movements such as the School Strikes for Climate gained worldwide attention (Thackeray et al., 
2020). We thus assess that specific characteristics of media coverage play a major role in climate 
understanding and perception (high confidence), including how IPCC assessments are received by the 
general public. 
 
Since AR5, social media platforms have dramatically altered the mass-media landscape, bringing about a 
shift from uni-directional transfer of information and ideas to more fluid, multi-directional flows (Pearce et 
al., 2019). A survey covering 18 Latin American countries (StatKnows-CR2, 2019) found that the main 
sources of information about climate change mentioned were the Internet (52% of mentions), followed by 
social media (18%). There are well-known challenges with social media, such as misleading or false 
presentations of scientific findings, incivility that diminishes the quality of discussion around climate change 
topics, and ‘filter bubbles’ that restrict interactions to those with broadly similar views (Anderson and 
Huntington, 2017). However, at certain moments (such as at the release of the AR5 WGI report), Twitter 
studies have found that more mixed, highly-connected groups existed, within which members were less 
polarized (Pearce et al., 2014; Williams et al., 2015). Thus, social media platforms may in some 
circumstances support dialogic or co-production approaches to climate communication. Because the contents 
of IPCC reports speak not only to policymakers, but also to the broader public, the character and effects of 
media coverage are important considerations across Working Groups.  
 

# 1.3  How we got here: the scientific context  
 
Scientific understanding of the climate system’s fundamental features is robust and well established. This 
section briefly presents the major lines of evidence in climate science (Figure 1.6). It illustrates their long 
history and summarises key findings from the WGI contribution to AR5, where relevant referencing 
previous IPCC assessments for comparison. Box 1.2 summarises major findings from three Special Reports 
already released during the sixth IPCC assessment cycle. This chapter’s Appendix 1A summarises the 
principal findings of all six IPCC WGI Assessment Reports, including the present one, in a single table for 
ready reference. 
 
<figref>1.6</figref>
 
 
## 1.3.1  Lines of evidence: instrumental observations 
 
Instrumental observations of the atmosphere, ocean, land, biosphere, and cryosphere underpin all 
understanding of the climate system. This section describes the evolution of instrumental data for major 
climate variables at Earth’s land and ocean surfaces, at altitude in the atmosphere, and at depth in the ocean. 
Many data records exist, of varying length, continuity, and spatial distribution; Figure 1.7 gives a schematic 
overview of temporal coverage.  
 
Instrumental weather observation at the Earth’s surface dates to the invention of thermometers and 
barometers in the 1600s. National and colonial weather services built networks of surface stations in the 
1800s. By the mid-19th century, semi-standardized naval weather logs recorded winds, currents, 
precipitation, air pressure, and temperature at sea, initiating the longest continuous quasi-global instrumental 
record (Maury, 1849, 1855, 1860). Because the ocean covers over 70% of global surface area and constantly 
exchange energy with the atmosphere, both air and sea surface temperatures (SST) recorded in these naval 
logs are crucial variables in climate studies. Dove (1853) mapped seasonal isotherms over most of the globe. 
By 1900, a patchy weather data-sharing system reached all continents except Antarctica. Regular 
compilation of climatological data for the world began in 1905 with the Réseau Mondial (Meteorological 
Office and Shaw, 1920), and the similar compilations World Weather Records (Clayton, 1927) and Monthly 
Climatic Data for the World (est. 1948) have been published continuously since their founding.  
 
Land and ocean surface temperature data have been repeatedly evaluated, refined, and extended (Section 
1.5.1). As computer power increased and older data were recovered from handwritten records, the number of 
surface station records used in published global land temperature time series grew. A pioneering study for 
1880–1935 used fewer than 150 stations (Callendar, 1938). A benchmark study of 1880–2005 incorporated 
4300 stations (Brohan et al., 2006). A study of the 1753–2011 period included previously unused station 
data, for a total of 36,000 stations (Rohde et al., 2013); recent versions of this dataset comprise over 40,000 
land stations (Rohde and Hausfather, 2020). Several centres, including NOAA, Hadley, and Japan 
Meteorological Agency (JMA), each produce SST datasets independently calculated from instrumental 
records. In the 2000s, adjustments for bias due to different measurement methods (buckets, engine intake 
thermometers, moored and drifting buoys) resulted in major improvements of SST data (Thompson et al., 
2008), and these improvements continue (Huang et al., 2017; Kennedy et al., 2019). SST and land-based data 
are incorporated into global surface temperature datasets calculated independently by multiple research 
groups, including NOAA, NASA, Berkeley Earth, Hadley-CRU, JMA, and China Meteorological 
Administration (CMA). Each group aggregates the raw measurement data, applies various adjustments for 
non-climatic biases such as urban heat-island effects, and addresses unevenness in geospatial and temporal 
sampling with various techniques (see Chapter 2, Section 2.3.1.1.3 and Table 2.4 for references). Other 
research groups provide alternative interpolations of these datasets using different methods (e.g., Cowtan and 
Way, 2014; Kadow et al., 2020). Using the then available global surface temperature datasets, WGI AR5 
assessed that the global mean surface temperature (GMST) increased by 0.85°C from 1880 to 2012 and 
found that each of the three decades following 1980 was successively warmer at the Earth’s surface than any 
preceding decade since 1850 (IPCC, 2013b). Marine air temperatures, especially those measured during 
night-time, are increasingly also used to examine variability and long-term trends (e.g., Rayner et al., 2006; 
Kent et al., 2013; Cornes et al., 2020; Junod and Christy, 2020). Cross-Chapter Box 2.3 in Chapter 2 
discusses updates to the global temperature datasets, provides revised estimates for the observed changes and 
considers whether marine air temperatures are changing at the same rate as SSTs. 
 
Data at altitude came initially from scattered mountain summits, balloons, and kites, but the upper 
troposphere and stratosphere were not systematically observed until radiosonde (weather balloon) networks 
emerged in the 1940s and 1950s. These provide the longest continuous quasi-global record of the 
atmosphere’s vertical dimension (Stickler et al., 2010). New methods for spatial and temporal 
homogenisation (intercalibration and quality control) of radiosonde records were introduced in the 2000s 
(Sherwood et al., 2008, 2015; Haimberger et al., 2012). Since 1978, Microwave Sounding Units (MSU) 
mounted on Earth-orbiting satellites have provided a second high-altitude data source, measuring 
temperature, humidity, ozone, and liquid water throughout the atmosphere. Over time, these satellite data 
have required numerous adjustments to account for such factors as orbital precession and decay (Edwards, 
2010). Despite repeated adjustments, however, marked differences remain in the temperature trends from 
surface, radiosonde, and satellite observations; between the results from three research groups that analyse 
satellite data (UAH, RSS, and NOAA); and between modelled and satellite-derived tropospheric warming 
trends (Thorne et al., 2011; Santer et al., 2017). These differences are the subject of ongoing research 
(Maycock et al., 2018). In the 2000s, Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and radio occultation (GNSS-
RO) measurements provided new ways to measure temperature at altitude, complementing data from the 
MSU. GNSS-RO is a new independent, absolutely calibrated source, using the refraction of radio-frequency 
signals from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) to measure temperature, pressure, and water 
vapour (Chapter 2, Section 2.3.1.2.1; Foelsche et al., 2008; Anthes, 2011). 
 
Heat-retaining properties of the atmosphere’s constituent gases were closely investigated in the 19th century. 
Foote, (1856) measured solar heating of CO2 experimentally and argued that higher concentrations in the 
atmosphere would increase Earth’s temperature. Water vapour, ozone, carbon dioxide, and certain 
hydrocarbons were found to absorb longwave (infrared) radiation, the principal mechanism of the 
greenhouse effect (Tyndall, 1861). 19th-century investigators also established the existence of a natural 
biogeochemical carbon cycle. CO2 emitted by volcanoes is removed from the atmosphere through a 
combination of silicate rock weathering, deep-sea sedimentation, oceanic absorption, and biological storage 
in plants, shellfish, and other organisms. On multi-million-year timescales, the compression of fossil organic 
matter stores carbon as coal, oil, and natural gas (Chamberlin, 1897, 1898; Ekholm, 1901).  
 
Arrhenius (1896) calculated that a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide would produce a 5–6°C warming, 
but in 1900 new measurements seemed to rule out CO2 as a greenhouse gas due to overlap with the 
absorption bands of water vapour (Ångström, 1900; Very and Abbe, 1901). Further investigation and more 
sensitive instruments later overturned Ångström’s conclusion (Fowle, 1917; Callendar, 1938). Nonetheless, 
the major role of CO2 in the energy balance of the atmosphere was not widely accepted until the 1950s 
(Callendar, 1949; Plass, 1956, 1961; Manabe and Möller, 1961; Weart, 2008; Edwards, 2010). Revelle and 
Keeling established carbon dioxide monitoring stations in Antarctica and Hawaii during the 1957–1958 
International Geophysical Year (Revelle and Suess, 1957; Keeling, 1960). These stations have tracked rising 
atmospheric CO2 concentrations from 315 ppm in 1958 to 414 ppm in 2020. Ground-based monitoring of 
other greenhouse gases followed. The Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSat) was launched in 2009, 
and two Orbiting Carbon Observatory satellite instruments have been in orbit since 2014.  

WGI AR5 highlighted ‘the other CO2 problem’ (Doney et al., 2009), that is, ocean acidification caused by 
the absorption of some 20–30% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and its conversion to 
carbonic acid in seawater. WGI AR5 assessed that the pH of ocean surface water has decreased by 0.1 since 
the beginning of the industrial era (high confidence), indicating approximately a 30% increase in acidity 
(IPCC, 2013b). 
 
With a heat capacity about 1000 times greater than that of the atmosphere, Earth’s ocean stores the vast 
majority of energy retained by the planet. Ocean currents transport the stored heat around the globe and, over 
decades to centuries, from the surface to its greatest depths. The ocean’s thermal inertia moderates faster 
changes in radiative forcing on land and in the atmosphere, reaching full equilibrium with the atmosphere 
only after hundreds to thousands of years (Yang and Zhu, 2011). The earliest subsurface measurements in 
the open ocean date to the 1770s (Abraham et al., 2013). From 1872–76, the research ship HMS Challenger 
measured global ocean temperature profiles at depths up to 1700 m along its cruise track. By 1900, research 
ships were deploying instruments such as Nansen bottles and Mechanical BathyThermographs (MBTs) to 
develop profiles of the upper 150 m in areas of interest to navies and commercial shipping (Abraham et al., 
2013). Starting in 1967, eXpendable BathyThermographs (XBTs) were deployed by scientific and 
commercial ships along repeated transects to measure temperature to 700 m (Goni et al., 2019). Ocean data 
collection expanded in the 1980s with the Tropical Ocean Global Experiment (TOGA; Gould, 2003). Marine 
surface observations for the globe, assembled in the mid-1980s in the International Comprehensive Ocean-
Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS; Woodruff et al., 1987, 2005), were extended to 1662–2014 using newly 
recovered marine records and metadata (Woodruff et al., 1998; Freeman et al., 2017). The Argo submersible 
float network developed in the early 2000s provided the first systematic global measurements of the 700–
2000 m layer. Comparing the HMS Challenger data to data from Argo submersible floats revealed global 
subsurface ocean warming on the centennial scale (Roemmich et al., 2012). WGI AR5 assessed with high 
confidence that ocean warming accounted for more than 90% of the additional energy accumulated by the 
climate system between 1971 and 2010 (IPCC, 2013b). In comparison, warming of the atmosphere 
corresponds to only about 1% of the additional energy accumulated over that period (IPCC, 2013a). Chapter 
2 summarises the ocean heat content datasets used in AR6 (Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3.1; Table 2.7).  
 
Water expands as it warms. This thermal expansion, along with glacier mass loss, were the dominant 
contributors to global mean sea level rise during the 20th century (high confidence) according to AR5 (IPCC, 
2013b). Sea level can be measured by averaging across tide gauges, some of which date to the 18th century. 
However, translating tide gauge readings into global mean sea levevl (GMSL) is challenging, since their 
spatial distribution is limited to continental coasts and islands, and their readings are relative to local coastal 
conditions that may shift vertically over time. Satellite radar altimetry, introduced operationally in the 1990s, 
complements the tide gauge record with geocentric measurements of GMSL at much greater spatial coverage 
(Katsaros and Brown, 1991; Fu et al., 1994). WGI AR5 assessed that global mean sea level rose by 0.19 
[0.17 to 0.21] m over the period 1901–2010, and that the rate of sea level rise increased from 2.0 [1.7 to 2.3] 
mm yr–1 in 1971–2010 to 3.2 [2.8 to 3.6] mm yr–1 from 1993–2010. Warming of the ocean very likely 
contributed 0.8 [0.5 to 1.1] mm yr–1 of sea level change during 1971–2010, with the majority of that 
contribution coming from the upper 700 m (IPCC, 2013b). Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3.3 assesses current 
understanding of the extent and rate of sea level rise, past and present. 
 
Satellite remote sensing also revolutionised studies of the cryosphere (Chapter 2, Section 2.3.2 and Chapter 
9, Sections 9.3 to 9.5), particularly near the poles where conditions make surface observations very difficult. 
Satellite mapping and measurement of snow cover began in 1966, with land and sea ice observations 
following in the mid-1970s. Yet prior to the Third Assessment Repor, researchers lacked sufficient data to 
tell whether the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets were shrinking or growing. Through a combination of 
satellite and airborne altimetry and gravity measurements, and improved knowledge of surface mass balance 
and perimeter fluxes, a consistent signal of ice loss for both ice sheets was established by the time of AR5 
(Shepherd et al., 2012). After 2000, satellite radar interferometry revealed rapid changes in surface velocity 
at ice-sheet margins, often linked to reduction or loss of ice shelves (Scambos et al., 2004; Rignot and 
Kanagaratnam, 2006). Whereas sea ice area and concentration were continuously monitored since 1979 from 
microwave imagery, datasets for ice thickness emerged later from upward sonar profiling by submarines 
(Rothrock et al., 1999) and radar altimetry of sea-ice freeboards (Laxon et al., 2003). A recent reconstruction 
of Arctic sea ice extent back to 1850 found no historical precedent for the Arctic sea ice minima of the 21st 
century (Walsh et al., 2017). Glacier length has been monitored for decades to centuries; internationally 
coordinated activities now compile worldwide glacier length and mass balance observations (World Glacier 
Monitoring Service, Zemp et al., 2015), global glacier outlines (Randolph Glacier Inventory, Pfeffer et al., 
2014), and ice thickness of about 1100 glaciers (GlaThiDa, Gärtner-Roer et al., 2014). In summary, these 
data allowed WGI AR5 to assess that over the last two decades, the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets have 
been losing mass, glaciers have continued to shrink almost worldwide, and Arctic sea ice and Northern 
Hemisphere spring snow cover have continued to decrease in extent (high confidence) (IPCC, 2013b).

## 1.3.2  Lines of evidence: paleoclimate 
 
With the gradual acceptance of geological ‘deep time’ in the 19th century came investigation of fossils, 
geological strata, and other evidence pointing to large shifts in the Earth’s climate, from ice ages to much 
warmer periods, across thousands to billions of years. This awareness set off a search for the causes of 
climatic changes. The long-term perspective provided by paleoclimate studies is essential to understanding 
the causes and consequences of natural variations in climate, as well as crucial context for recent 
anthropogenic climatic change. The reconstruction of climate variability and change over recent millennia 
began in the 1800s (Brückner et al., 2000; Brückner, 2018 [1890]; Coen, 2018, 2020). In brief, 
paleoclimatology reveals the key role of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in past climatic 
variability and change, the magnitude of recent climate change in comparison to past glacial-interglacial 
cycles, and the unusualness recent climate change (Section 1.2.1.2; Cross Chapter Box 2.1 in Chapter 2; 
Tierney et al., 2020). FAQ 1.3 provides a plain-language summary of its importance. 
 
Paleoclimate studies reconstruct the evolution of Earth’s climate over hundreds to billions of years using pre-
instrumental historical archives, indigenous knowledge and natural archives left behind by geological, 
chemical, and biological processes (Figure 1.7). Paleoclimatology covers a wide range of temporal scales, 
ranging from the human historical past (decades to millennia) to geological deep time (millions to billions of 
years). Paleoclimate reference periods are presented in Cross Chapter Box 2.1 in Chapter 2. 
 
Historical climatology aids near-term paleoclimate reconstructions using media such as diaries, almanacs, 
and merchant accounts that describe climate-related events such as frosts, thaws, flowering dates, harvests, 
crop prices, and droughts (Lamb, 1965, 1995; Le Roy Ladurie, 1967; Brázdil et al., 2005). Meticulous 
records by Chinese scholars and government workers, for example, have permitted detailed reconstructions 
of China’s climate back to 1000 CE, and even beyond (Louie and Liu, 2003; Ge et al., 2008). Climatic 
phenomena such as large-scale, regionally and temporally distributed warmer and cooler periods of the past 
2000 years were originally reconstructed from European historical records (Lamb, 1965, 1995; Le Roy 
Ladurie, 1967; Neukom et al., 2019). 
 
Indigenous and local knowledge have played an increasing role in historical climatology, especially in areas 
where instrumental observations are sparse. Peruvian fishermen named the periodic El Niño warm current in 
the Pacific, linked by later researchers to the Southern Oscillation (Cushman, 2004). Inuit communities have 
contributed to climatic history and community based monitoring across the Arctic (Riedlinger and Berkes, 
2001; Gearheard et al., 2010). Indigenous Australian knowledge of climatic patterns has been offered as a 
complement to sparse observational records (Green et al., 2010; Head et al., 2014), such as those of sea-level 
rise (Nunn and Reid, 2016). Ongoing research seeks to conduct further dialogue, utilise Indigenous and local 
knowledge as an independent line of evidence complementing scientific understanding, and analyse their 
utility for multiple purposes, especially adaptation (Laidler, 2006; Alexander et al., 2011; IPCC, 2019c). 
Indigenous and local knowledge are used most extensively by IPCC Working Group II. 
 
Certain geological and biological materials preserve evidence of past climate changes. These ‘natural 
archives’ include corals, trees, glacier ice, speleothems (stalactites and stalagmites), loess deposits (dust 
sediments), fossil pollen, peat, lake sediment, and marine sediment (Stuiver, 1965; Eddy, 1976; Haug et al., 
2001; Wang et al., 2001; Jones et al., 2009; Bradley, 2015). By the early 20th century, laboratory research 
had begun using tree rings to reconstruct precipitation and the possible influence of sunspots on climatic 
change (Douglass, 1914, 1919, 1922). Radiocarbon dating, developed in the 1940s (Arnold and Libby, 
1949), allows accurate determination of the age of carbon-containing materials from the past 50,000 years; 
this dating technique ushered in an era of rapid progress in paleoclimate studies.  
 
On longer timescales, tiny air bubbles trapped in polar ice sheets provide direct evidence of past atmospheric 
composition, including CO2 levels (Petit et al., 1999), and the 18O isotope in frozen precipitation serves as a 
proxy marker for temperature (Dansgaard, 1954). Sulphate deposits in glacier ice and as ash layers within 
sediment record major volcanic eruptions, providing another mechanism for dating. The first paleoclimate 
reconstructions used an almost 100,000-year ice core taken at Camp Century, Greenland (Dansgaard et al., 
1969; Langway Jr, 2008). Subsequent cores from Antarctica extended this climatic record to 800,000 years 
(EPICA Community Members, 2004; Jouzel, 2013). Comparisons of air contained in these ice samples 
against measurements from the recent past enabled WGI AR5 to assess that atmospheric concentrations of 
CO2, methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) had all increased to levels unprecedented in at least the last 
800,000 years (IPCC, 2013b) (see Section 1.2.1.2, Figure 1.5). 
 
Global reconstructions of sea surface temperature were developed from material contained in deep-sea 
sediment cores (CLIMAP Project Members et al., 1976), providing the first quantitative constraints for 
model simulations of ice age climates (e.g., Rind and Peteet, 1985). Paleoclimate data and modelling showed 
that the Atlantic Ocean circulation has not been stable over glacial-interglacial time periods, and that many 
changes in ocean circulation are associated with abrupt transitions in climate in the North Atlantic region 
(Ruddiman and McIntyre, 1981; Broecker et al., 1985; Boyle and Keigwin, 1987; Manabe and Stouffer, 
1988). 
 
By the early 20th century, cyclical changes in insolation due to the interacting periodicities of orbital 
eccentricity, axial tilt, and axial precession had been hypothesised as a chief pacemaker of ice age-
interglacial cycles on multi-millennial timescales (Milankovich, 1920). Paleoclimate information derived 
from marine sediment provides quantitative estimates of past temperature, ice volume, and sea level over 
millions of years (Section 1.2.1.2, Figure 1.5) (Emiliani, 1955; Shackleton and Opdyke, 1973; Siddall et al., 
2003; Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005; Past Interglacials Working Group of PAGES, 2016). These estimates have 
bolstered the orbital cycles hypothesis (Hays et al., 1976; Berger, 1977, 1978). However, paleoclimatology 
of multi-million to billion-year periods reveals that methane, carbon dioxide, continental drift, silicate rock 
weathering, and other factors played a greater role than orbital cycles in climate changes during ice-free 
‘hothouse’ periods of Earth’s distant past (Frakes et al., 1992; Bowen et al., 2015; Zeebe et al., 2016). 
 
The WGI AR5 (IPCC, 2013b) used paleoclimatic evidence to put recent warming and sea level rise in a 
multi-century perspective and assessed that 1983–2012 was likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 
1400 years in the Northern Hemisphere (medium confidence). AR5 also assessed that the rate of sea level 
rise since the mid-19th century has been larger than the mean rate during the previous two millennia (high 
confidence). 
 
 
## 1.3.3  Lines of evidence: identifying natural and human drivers 
 
The climate is a globally interconnected system driven by solar energy. Scientists in the 19th-century 
established the main physical principles governing Earth’s temperature. By 1822, the principle of radiative 
equilibrium (the balance between absorbed solar radiation and the energy Earth re-radiates into space) had 
been articulated, and the atmosphere’s role in retaining heat had been likened to a greenhouse (Fourier, 
1822). The primary explanations for natural climate change — greenhouse gases, orbital factors, solar 
irradiance, continental position, volcanic outgassing, silicate rock weathering, and the formation of coal and 
carbonate rock — were all identified by the late 1800s (Fleming, 1998; Weart, 2008). 
 
The natural and anthropogenic factors responsible for climate change are known today as radiative ‘drivers’ 
or ‘forcers’. The net change in the energy budget at the top of the atmosphere, resulting from a change in one 
or more such drivers, is termed radiative forcing (RF; see Annex VII: Glossary) and measured in Watts per 
square metre (W m-2). The total radiative forcing over a given time interval (often since 1750) represents the 
sum of positive drivers (inducing warming) and negative ones (inducing cooling). Past IPCC reports have 
assessed scientific knowledge of these drivers, quantified their range for the period since 1750, and presented 
the current understanding of how they interact in the climate system. Like all previous IPCC reports, AR5 
assessed that total radiative forcing has been positive at least since 1850–1900, leading to an uptake of 
energy by the climate system, and that the largest single contribution to total radiative forcing is the rising 
atmospheric concentration of CO2 since 1750 (IPCC, 2013a; see Cross-Chapter Box 1.2 and Chapter 7).  
 
Natural drivers include changes in solar irradiance, ocean currents, naturally occurring aerosols, and natural 
sources and sinks of radiatively active gases such as water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and sulphur 
dioxide. Detailed global measurements of surface-level solar irradiance were first conducted during the 
1957–1958 International Geophysical Year (Landsberg, 1961), while top-of-atmosphere irradiance has been 
measured by satellites since 1959 (House et al., 1986). Measured changes in solar irradiance have been small 
and slightly negative since about 1980 (Matthes et al., 2017). Water vapour is the most abundant radiatively 
active gas, accounting for about 75% of the terrestrial greenhouse effect, but because its residence time in the 
atmosphere averages just 8–10 days, its atmospheric concentration is largely governed by temperature (van 
der Ent and Tuinenburg, 2017; Nieto and Gimeno, 2019). As a result, non-condensing greenhouse gases with 
much longer residence times serve as ‘control knobs’, regulating planetary temperature, with water vapour 
concentrations as a feedback effect (Lacis et al., 2010, 2013). The most important of these non-condensing 
gases is carbon dioxide (a positive driver), released naturally by volcanism at about 637 MtCO2 yr-1 in recent 
decades, or roughly 1.6% of the 37 GtCO2 emitted by human activities in 2018 (Burton et al., 2013; Le 
Quéré et al., 2018). Absorption by the ocean and uptake by plants and soils are the primary natural CO2 sinks 
on decadal to centennial time scales (see Chapter 5, Section 5.1.2 and Figure 5.3).  
 
Aerosols (tiny airborne particles) interact with climate in numerous ways, some direct (e.g. reflecting solar 
radiation back into space) and others indirect (e.g., cloud droplet nucleation); specific effects may cause 
either positive or negative radiative forcing. Major volcanic eruptions inject sulphur dioxide (SO2, a negative 
driver) into the stratosphere, creating aerosols that can cool the planet for years at a time by reflecting some 
incoming solar radiation. The history and climatic effects of volcanic activity have been traced through 
historical records, geological traces, and observations of major eruptions by aircraft, satellites, and other 
instruments (Dörries, 2006). The negative RF of major volcanic eruptions was considered in the First 
Assessment Report (FAR; IPCC, 1990a). In subsequent assessments, the negative RF of smaller eruptions 
has also been considered (e.g., Chapter 2, section 2.4.3 in IPCC, 1995; Cross-Chapter Box 4.1 in Chapter 4 
of this report). Dust and other natural aerosols have been studied since the 1880s (e.g., Aitken, 1889; 
Ångström, 1929, 1964; Twomey, 1959), particularly in relation to their role in cloud nucleation, an aerosol 
indirect effect whose RF may be either positive or negative depending on such factors as cloud altitude, 
depth, and albedo (Stevens and Feingold, 2009; Boucher et al., 2013). 
 
Anthropogenic (human) drivers of climatic change were hypothesised as early as the 17th century, with a 
primary focus on forest clearing and agriculture (Grove, 1995; Fleming, 1998). In the 1890s, Arrhenius was 
first to calculate the effects of increased or decreased CO2 concentrations on planetary temperature, and 
Högbom estimated that worldwide coal combustion of about 500 Mt yr-1 had already completely offset the 
natural absorption of CO2 by silicate rock weathering (Högbom, 1894; Arrhenius, 1896; Berner, 1995; 
Crawford, 1997). As coal consumption reached 900 Mt yr-1 only a decade later, Arrhenius wrote that 
anthropogenic carbon dioxide from fossil fuel combustion might eventually warm the planet (Arrhenius, 
1908). In 1938, analysing records from 147 stations around the globe, Callendar calculated atmospheric 
warming over land at 0.3-0.4°C from 1880-1935 and attributed about half of this warming to anthropogenic 
CO2 (Callendar, 1938; Fleming, 2007; Hawkins and Jones, 2013; Figure 1.8). 
 
<figref>1.8</figref> 
 
Studies of radiocarbon (14C) in the 1950s established that increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations were 
due to fossil fuel combustion. Since all the 14C once contained in fossil fuels long ago decayed into non-
radioactive 12C, the CO2 produced by their combustion reduces the overall concentration of atmospheric 14C 
(Suess, 1955). Related work demonstrated that while the ocean was absorbing around 30% of anthropogenic 
CO2, these emissions were also accumulating in the atmosphere and biosphere (see Section 1.3.1 and 
Chapter 5, Section 5.2.1.5). Further work later established that atmospheric oxygen levels were decreasing in 
inverse relation to the anthropogenic CO2 increase, because combustion of carbon consumes oxygen to 
produce CO2 (Keeling and Shertz, 1992; IPCC, 2013a, Chapters 2 and 6). Revelle and Suess (1957) 
famously described fossil fuel emissions as a ‘large scale geophysical experiment’, in which ‘within a few 
centuries we are returning to the atmosphere and ocean the concentrated organic carbon stored in 
sedimentary rocks over hundreds of millions of years’. The 1960s saw increasing attention to other 
radiatively active gases, especially ozone (Manabe and Möller, 1961; Plass, 1961). Methane and nitrous 
oxide were not considered systematically until the 1970s, when anthropogenic increases in those gases were 
first noted (Wang et al., 1976). In the 1970s and 1980s, scientists established that synthetic halocarbons (see 
Annex VII: Glossary), including widely used refrigerants and propellants, were extremely potent greenhouse 
gases (Ramanathan, 1975; Chapter 2, Section 2.2.4.3; Chapter 6, section 6.2.2.9). When these chemicals 
were also found to be depleting the stratospheric ozone layer, they were stringently and successfully 
regulated on a global basis by the 1987 Montreal Protocol on the Ozone Layer and successor agreements 
(Parson, 2003).  
 
Radioactive fallout from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing (1940s–1950s) and urban smog (1950s–
1960s) first provoked widespread attention to anthropogenic aerosols and ozone in the troposphere 
(Edwards, 2012). Theory, measurement, and modelling of these substances developed steadily from the 
1950s (Hidy, 2019). However, the radiative effects of anthropogenic aerosols did not receive sustained study 
until around 1970 (Bryson and Wendland, 1970; Rasool and Schneider, 1971), when their potential as 
cooling agents was recognised (Peterson et al., 2008). The US Climatic Impact Assessment Program (CIAP) 
found that proposed fleets of supersonic aircraft, flying in the stratosphere, might cause substantial aerosol 
cooling and depletion of the ozone layer, stimulating efforts to understand and model stratospheric 
circulation, atmospheric chemistry, and aerosol radiative effects (Mormino et al., 1975; Toon and Pollack, 
1976). Since the 1980s, aerosols have increasingly been integrated into comprehensive modelling studies of 
transient climate evolution and anthropogenic influences, through treatment of volcanic forcing, links to 
global dimming and cloud brightening, and their influence on cloud nucleation and other properties (e.g., 
thickness, lifetime, and extent) and precipitation (e.g., Hansen et al., 1981; Charlson et al., 1987, 1992; 
Albrecht, 1989; Twomey, 1991). 
 
The FAR (1990) focused attention on human emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, tropospheric ozone, 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and nitrous oxide. Of these, at that time only the emissions of CO2 and CFCs 
were well measured, with methane sources known only ‘semi-quantitatively’ (IPCC, 1990a). The FAR 
assessed that some other trace gases, especially CFCs, have global warming potentials hundreds to thousands 
of times greater than CO2 and methane, but are emitted in much smaller amounts. As a result, CO2 remains 
by far the most important positive anthropogenic driver, with methane next most significant (Section 1.6.3); 
anthropogenic methane stems from such sources as fossil fuel extraction, natural gas pipeline leakage, 
agriculture, and landfills. In 2001, increased greenhouse forcing attributable to CO2, methane, ozone, CFC-
11, and CFC-12 was detected by comparing satellite measurements of outgoing longwave radiation 
measurements taken in 1970 and in 1997 (Harries et al., 2001). AR5 assessed that the 40% increase in 
atmospheric CO2 contributed most to positive RF since 1750. Together, changes in atmospheric 
concentrations of CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, and halocarbons from 1750–2011 were assessed to contribute 
a positive RF of 2.83 [2.26 to 3.40] W m–2 (IPCC, 2013b). 
 
All IPCC reports have assessed the total RF as positive when considering all sources. However, due to the 
considerable variability of both natural and anthropogenic aerosol loads, the FAR characterised total aerosol 
RF as ‘highly uncertain’ and was unable even to determine its sign (positive or negative). Major advances in 
quantification of aerosol loads and their effects have taken place since then, and IPCC reports since 1992 
have consistently assessed total forcing by anthropogenic aerosols as negative (IPCC, 1992, 1995a, 1996). 
However, due to their complexity and the difficulty of obtaining precise measurements, aerosol effects have 
been consistently assessed as the largest single source of uncertainty in estimating total RF (Stevens and 
Feingold, 2009; IPCC, 2013a). Overall, AR5 assessed that total aerosol effects, including cloud adjustments, 
resulted in a negative RF of –0.9 [–1.9 to −0.1] W m−2 (medium confidence), offsetting a substantial portion 
of the positive RF resulting from the increase in greenhouse gases (high confidence) (IPCC, 2013b). Chapter 
7 provides an updated assessment of the total and per-component RF for the WGI contribution to AR6. 
 
 
## 1.3.4  Lines of evidence: understanding and attributing climate change 
 
Understanding the global climate system requires both theoretical understanding and empirical measurement 
of the major forces and factors that govern the transport of energy and mass (air, water and water vapour) 
around the globe; the chemical and physical properties of the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and land 
surfaces; and the biological and physical dynamics of natural ecosystems, as well as the numerous feedbacks 
(both positive and negative) among these processes. Attributing climatic changes or extreme weather events 
to human activity (see Cross Working Group Box: Attribution) requires, additionally, understanding of the 
many ways that human activities may affect the climate, along with statistical and other techniques for 
separating the ‘signal’ of anthropogenic climate change from the ‘noise’ of natural climate variability (see 
Section 1.4.2). This inter- and trans-disciplinary effort requires contributions from many sciences.  
 
Due to the complexity of many interacting processes ranging in scale from the molecular to the global, and 
occurring on timescales from seconds to millennia, attribution makes extensive use of conceptual, 
mathematical, and computer simulation models. Modelling allows scientists to combine a vast range of 
theoretical and empirical understanding from physics, chemistry, and other natural sciences, producing 
estimates of their joint consequences as simulations of past, present, or future states and trends (Nebeker, 
1995; Edwards, 2010, 2011). 
 
In addition to radiative transfer (discussed above in Section 1.3.3), forces and factors such as 
thermodynamics (energy conversions), gravity, surface friction, and the Earth's rotation govern the 
planetary-scale movements or ‘circulation’ of air and water in the climate system. The scientific theory of 
climate began with Halley (1686), who hypothesized vertical atmospheric circulatory cells driven by solar 
heating, and Hadley (1735), who showed how the Earth’s rotation affects that circulation. Ferrel (1856) 
added the Coriolis force to existing theory, explaining the major structures of the global atmospheric 
circulation. In aggregate, prevailing winds and ocean currents move energy poleward from the equatorial 
regions where the majority of incoming solar radiation is received. 
 
Climate models provide the ability to simulate these complex circulatory processes, and to improve the 
physical theory of climate by testing different mathematical formulations of those processes. Since 
controlled experiments at planetary scale are impossible, climate simulations provide one important way to 
explore the differential effects and interactions of variables such as solar irradiance, aerosols, and greenhouse 
gases. To assess their quality, models or compontents of models may be compared with observations. For 
this reason, they can be used to attribute observed climatic effects to different natural and human drivers 
(Hegerl et al., 2011). As early as Arrhenius (1896), simple mathematical models were used to calculate the 
effects of doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide over pre-industrial concentrations (~550 ppm vs ~275 ppm). 
In the early 1900s Bjerknes formulated the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics for motion of the 
atmosphere (Bjerknes, 1906; Bjerknes et al., 1910), and Richardson (1922) developed a system for numerical 
weather prediction based on these equations. When electronic computers became available in the late 1940s, 
the methods of Bjerknes and Richardson were successfully applied to weather forecasting (Charney et al., 
1950; Nebeker, 1995; Harper, 2008).  
 
In the 1960s similar approaches to modelling the weather were used to model the climate, but with much 
longer runs than daily forecasting (Smagorinsky et al., 1965; Manabe and Wetherald, 1967). Simpler 
statistical and one- and two-dimensional modelling approaches continued in tandem with the more complex 
General Circulation Models (GCMs) (Manabe and Wetherald, 1967; Budyko, 1969; Sellers, 1969). The first 
coupled atmosphere-ocean model (AOGCM) with realistic topography appeared in 1975 (Bryan et al., 1975; 
Manabe et al., 1975). Rapid increases in computer power enabled higher resolutions, longer model 
simulations, and the inclusion of additional physical processes in GCMs, such as aerosols, atmospheric 
chemistry, sea ice, and snow.   
 
In the 1990s, AOGCMs were state of the art. By the 2010s, Earth system models (ESMs, also known as 
coupled carbon-cycle climate models) incorporated land surface, vegetation, the carbon cycle, and other 
elements of the climate system. Since the 1990s, some major modelling centres have deployed ‘unified’ 
models for both weather prediction and climate modelling, with the goal of a seamless modelling approach 
that uses the same dynamics, physics, and parameterisations at multiple scales of time and space (Cullen, 
1993; Brown et al., 2012; NRC Committee on a National Strategy for Advancing Climate Modeling, 2012; 
Brunet et al., 2015; Chapter 10, Section 10.1.2). Because weather forecast models make short-term 
predictions that can be frequently verified, and improved models are introduced and tested iteratively on 
cycles as short as 18 months, this approach allows major portions of the climate model to be evaluated as a 
weather model and more frequently improved. However, all climate models exhibit biases of different 
degrees and types, and the practice of ‘tuning’ parameter values in models to make their outputs match 
variables such as historical warming trajectories has generated concern throughout their history (Randall and 
Wielicki, 1997; Edwards, 2010; Hourdin et al., 2017; see also 1.5.3.2). Overall, the WGI AR5 assessed that 
climate models had improved since previous reports (IPCC, 2013b) . 
 
Since climate models vary along many dimensions, such as grid type, resolution, and parameterizations, 
comparing their results requires special techniques. To address this problem, the climate modelling 
community developed increasingly sophisticated Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) (Gates et al., 1999; 
Covey et al., 2003). MIPs prescribe standardised experiment designs, time periods, output variables, or 
observational reference data, to facilitate direct comparison of model results. This aids in diagnosing the 
reasons for biases and other differences among models, and furthers process understanding (Section 1.5). 
Both the CMIP3 and CMIP5 model intercomparison projects included experiments testing the ability of 
models to reproduce 20th century global surface temperature trends both with and without anthropogenic 
forcings. Although some individual model runs failed to achieve this (Hourdin et al., 2017), the mean trends 
of multi-model ensembles did so successfully (Meehl et al., 2007a; Taylor et al., 2012). When only natural 
forcings were included (creating the equivalent of a ‘control Earth’ without human influences), similar multi-
model ensembles could not reproduce the observed post-1970 warming at either global or regional scales 
(Edwards, 2010; Jones et al., 2013). The GCMs and ESMs compared in CMIP6 (used in this report) offer 
more explicit documentation and evaluation of tuning procedures (Schmidt et al., 2017; Burrows et al., 2018; 
Mauritsen and Roeckner, 2020); see Section 1.5).  
 
The FAR (IPCC, 1990a) concluded that while both theory and models suggested that anthropogenic 
warming was already well underway, its signal could not yet be detected in observational data against the 
‘noise’ of natural variability (also see Barnett and Schlesinger (1987) and Section 1.4.2). Since then, 
increased warming and progressively more conclusive attribution studies have identified human activities as 
the ‘dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century’ (IPCC, 2013b). ‘Fingerprint’ 
studies seek to detect specific observed changes – expected from theoretical understanding and model results 
– that could not be explained by natural drivers alone, and to attribute statistically the proportion of such 
changes that is due to human influence. These include global-scale surface warming, nights warming faster 
than days, tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling, a rising tropopause, increasing ocean heat 
content, changed global patterns of precipitation and sea-level air pressure, increasing downward longwave 
radiation, and decreasing upward longwave radiation (Hasselmann, 1979; Schneider, 1994; Karoly et al., 
1994; Santer et al., 1995, 2013, Hegerl et al., 1996, 1997; Gillett et al., 2003; Santer, 2003; Zhang et al., 
2007; Stott et al., 2010; Davy et al., 2017; Mann et al., 2017). Cross Working Group Box 1.1 outlines 
attribution methods and uses from across the AR6, now including event attribution (specifying the influence 
of climate change on individual extreme events such as floods, or on the frequency of classes of events such 
as tropical cyclones). Overall, the evidence for human influence has grown substantially over time and from 
each IPCC report to the subsequent one. 
 
A key indicator of climate understanding is whether theoretical climate system budgets or ‘inventories’, such 
as the balance of incoming and outgoing energy at the surface and at the top of the atmosphere, can be 
quantified and closed observationally. The global energy budget, for example, includes energy retained in 
the atmosphere, upper ocean, deep ocean, ice, and land surface. Church et al. (2013) assessed in AR5 with 
high confidence that independent estimates of effective radiative forcing (ERF), observed heat storage, and 
surface warming combined to give an energy budget for the Earth that is consistent with the WGI AR5 
assessed likely range of equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) [1.5°C to 4.5°C] to within estimated 
uncertainties (IPCC, 2013a; on ECS, see Section 1.3.5 below). Similarly, over the period 1993 to 2010, when 
observations of all sea level components were available, WGI AR5 assessed the observed global mean sea 
level rise to be consistent with the sum of the observed contributions from ocean thermal expansion (due to 
warming) combined with changes in glaciers, the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets, and land water storage 
(high confidence). Verification that the terms of these budgets balance over recent decades provides strong 
evidence for our understanding of anthropogenic climate change (Cross-Chapter Box 9.1 in Chapter 9). 
 
The Appendix to Chapter 1 (Appendix 1A) lists the key detection and attribution statements in the 
Summaries for Policymakers of WGI reports since 1990. The evolution of these statements over time reflects 
the improvement of scientific understanding and the corresponding decrease in uncertainties regarding 
human influences. The SAR stated that ‘the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on 
global climate’ (IPCC, 1995b). Five years later, the TAR concluded that ‘there is new and stronger evidence 
that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities’ (IPCC, 2001b). 
AR4 further strengthened previous statements, concluding that ‘most of the observed increase in global 
average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas concentrations’ (IPCC, 2007b). AR5 assessed that a human contribution had been detected to 
changes in warming of the atmosphere and ocean; changes in the global water cycle; reductions in snow and 
ice; global mean sea level rise; and changes in some climate extremes. AR5 concluded that ‘it is extremely 
likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th 
century’ (IPCC, 2013b).  
 
 
## 1.3.5  Projections of future climate change 
 
It was recognised in IPCC AR5 that information about the near term was increasingly relevant for adaptation 
decisions. In response, WGI AR5 made a specific assessment for how global surface temperature was 
projected to evolve over the next two decades, concluding that the change for the period 2016–2035 relative 
to 1986–2005 will likely be in the range of 0.3°C to 0.7°C (medium confidence), assuming no major volcanic 
eruptions or secular changes in total solar irradiance (IPCC, 2013b). AR5 was also the first IPCC assessment 
report to assess ‘decadal predictions’ of the climate, where the observed state of the climate system was used 
to start forecasts for a few years ahead. AR6 examines updates to these decadal predictions (Chapter 4, 
Section 4.4.1). 
 
The assessments and predictions for the near-term evolution of global climate features are largely 
independent of future carbon emissions pathways. However, WGI AR5 assessed that limiting climate change 
in the long-term future will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions (IPCC, 
2013b). This assessment results from decades of research on understanding the climate system and its 
perturbations, and projecting climate change into the future. Each IPCC report has considered a range of 
emission scenarios, typically including a scenario in which societies choose to continue on their present 
course as well as several others reflecting socioeconomic and policy responses that may limit emissions 
and/or increase the rate of carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere. Climate models are used to project 
the outcomes of each scenario. However, future human climate influence cannot be precisely predicted 
because greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions, land use, energy use, and other human activities may change 
in numerous ways. Common emission scenarios used in the WGI contribution to AR6 are detailed in Section 
1.6.  
 
Based on model results and steadily increasing CO2 concentrations (Bolin and Bischof, 1970; SMIC, 1971; 
Meadows et al., 1972), concerns about future ‘risk of effects on climate’ were addressed in Recommendation 
70 of the Stockholm Action Plan, resulting from the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human 
Environment. Numerous other scientific studies soon amplified these concerns (summarised in Schneider 
(1975), and Williams (1978); see also Nordhaus (1975, 1977). In 1979, a US National Research Council 
(NRC) group led by Jule Charney reported on the ‘best present understanding of the carbon dioxide/climate 
issue for the benefit of policymakers’, initiating an era of regular and repeated large-scale assessments of 
climate science findings. 
 
The 1979 Charney NRC report estimated equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) at 3°C, stating the range as 
2°C–4.5°C, based on ‘consistent and mutually supporting’ model results and expert judgment (NRC, 1979). 
ECS is defined in IPCC assessments as the global surface air temperature (GSAT) response to CO2 doubling 
(from pre-industrial levels) after the climate has reached equilibrium (stable energy balance between the 
atmosphere and ocean). Another quantity, transient climate response (TCR), was later introduced as the 
global surface air temperature change, averaged over a 20-year period, at the time of CO2 doubling in a 
scenario of concentration increasing at 1% per year). Calculating ECS from historical or paleoclimate 
temperature records in combination with energy budget models has produced estimates both lower and 
higher than those calculated using GCMs and ESMs; in AR6, these are assessed in Chapter 7, Section 7.5.2.  
 
ECS is typically characterised as most relevant on centennial timescales, while TCR was long seen as a more 
appropriate measure of the 50-100 year response to gradually increasing CO2; however, recent studies have 
raised new questions about how accurately both quantities are estimated by GCMs and ESMs (Grose et al., 
2018; Meehl et al., 2020; Sherwood et al., 2020). Further, as climate models evolved to include a full-depth 
ocean, the time scale for reaching full equilibrium became longer and new methods to estimate ECS had to 
be developed (Gregory et al., 2004; Meehl et al., 2020; Meinshausen et al., 2020). Because of these 
considerations as well as new estimates from observation-based, paleoclimate, and emergent-constraints 
studies (Sherwood et al., 2020), the AR6 definition of ECS has changed from previous reports; it now 
includes all feedbacks except those associated with ice sheets. Accordingly, unlike previous reports, the AR6 
assessments of ECS and TCR are not based primarily on GCM and ESM model results (see Chapter 7, Box. 
7.1 and Section 7.5.5 for a full discussion). 
 
Today, other sensitivity terms are sometimes used, such as transient climate response to emissions (TCRE, 
defined as the ratio of warming to cumulative CO2 emissions in a CO2-only simulation) and Earth system 
sensitivity (ESS), which includes multi-century Earth system feedbacks such as changes in ice sheets. Table 
1.2 shows estimates of ECS and TCR for major climate science assessments since 1979. The table shows 
that despite some variation in the range of GCM and (for the later assessments) ESM results, expert 
assessment of ECS changed little between 1979 and the present report. Based on multiple lines of evidence, 
AR6 has narrowed the likely range of ECS to 2.5-4.0 °C (Chapter 7, Section 7.5.5). 
 
<tableref>1.2</tableref>
 
WGI AR5 assessed that there is a close relationship of cumulative total emissions of CO2 and global mean 
surface temperature response that is approximately linear (IPCC, 2013b). This finding implies that continued 
emissions of carbon dioxide will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate 
system, independent of any specific scenario or pathway. Scenario-based climate projections using the 
Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) assessed in WGI AR5 result in continued warming over the 
21st century in all scenarios except a strong climate change mitigation scenario (RCP2.6). Similarly, under 
all RCP scenarios, AR5 assessed that the rate of sea level rise over the 21st century will very likely exceed 
that observed during 1971–2010 due to increased ocean warming and increased loss of mass from glaciers 
and ice sheets. Further increases in atmospheric CO2 will also lead to further uptake of carbon by the ocean, 
which will increase ocean acidification. By the mid-21st century the magnitudes of the projected changes are 
substantially affected by the choice of scenario. The set of scenarios used in climate change projections 
assessed as part of the AR6 are discussed in Section 1.6. 
 
From the close link between cumulative emissions and warming it follows that any given level of global 
warming is associated with a total budget of GHG emissions, especially CO2 as it is the largest long-lasting 
contributor to radiative forcing (Allen et al., 2009; Collins et al., 2013; Rogelj et al., 2019). Higher emissions 
in earlier decades imply lower emissions later on to stay within the Earth's carbon budget. Stabilising the 
anthropogenic influence on global surface temperature thus requires that CO2 emissions and removals reach 
net zero once the remaining carbon budget is exhausted (see Cross-Chapter Box 1.4). 
 
Past, present and future emissions of CO2 therefore commit the world to substantial multi-century climate 
change, and many aspects of climate change would persist for centuries even if emissions of CO2 were 
stopped immediately (IPCC, 2013b). According to AR5, a large fraction of this change is essentially 
irreversible on a multi-century to millennial time scale, barring large net removal (‘negative emissions’) of 
CO2 from the atmosphere over a sustained period through as yet unavailable technological means (IPCC, 
2013a, 2018; see Chapters 4 and 5). However, significant reductions of warming due to SLCFs could reduce 
the level at which temperature stabilises once CO2 emissions reach net zero, and also reduce the long-term 
global warming commitment by reducing radiative forcing from SLCFs (Chapter 5). 
 
In summary, major lines of evidence – observations, paleoclimate, theoretical understanding, and natural and 
human drivers — have been studied and developed for over 150 years. Methods for projecting climate 
futures have matured since the 1950s and attribution studies since the 1980s. We conclude that 
understanding of the principal features of the climate system is robust and well established. 
 
 
## 1.3.6  How do previous climate projections compare with subsequent observations? 
 
Many different sets of climate projections have been produced over the past several decades, so it is valuable 
to assess how well those projections have compared against subsequent observations. Consisent findings 
build confidence in the process of making projections for the future. For example, Stouffer and Manabe 
(2017) compared projections made in the early 1990s with subsequent observations. They found that the 
projected surface pattern of warming, and the vertical structure of temperature change in both the atmosphere 
and ocean, were realistic. Rahmstorf et al. (2007, 2012) examined projections of global surface 
temperatureand global mean sea level assessed by the TAR and AR4 and found that the global surface 
temperature projections were in good agreement with the subsequent observations, but that sea level 
projections were underestimates compared to subsequent observations. WGI AR5 also examined earlier 
IPCC Assessment Reports to evaluate their projections of how global surface temperature and global mean 
sea level would change (Cubasch et al., 2013) with similar conclusions.  
 
Although these studies generally showed good agreement between the past projections and subsequent 
observations, this type of analysis is complicated because the scenarios of future radiative forcing used in 
earlier projections do not precisely match the actual radiative forcings that subsequently occurred. 
Mismatches between the projections and subsequent observations could be due to incorrectly projected 
radiative forcings (e.g., aerosol emissions, greenhouse gas concentrations or volcanic eruptions that were not 
included), an incorrect modelled response to those forcings, or both. Alternatively, agreement between 
projections and observations may be fortuitous due to a compensating balance of errors, for example, too low 
climate sensitivity but too strong radiative forcings. 
 
One approach to partially correct for mismatches between the forcings used in the projections and the 
forcings that actually occurred is described by Hausfather et al. (2020). Model projections of global surface 
temperatureand estimated radiative forcings were taken from several historical studies, along with the 
baseline no-policy scenarios from the first four IPCC assessment reports. These model projections of 
temperature and radiative forcing are then compared to (a) the observed change in temperature through time 
over the projection period, and (b) the observed change in temperature relative to the observationally-
estimated radiative forcing over the projection period (Figure 1.9; data from Hausfather et al. (2020)).  
 
Although this approach has limitations when the modelled forcings differ greatly from the forcings 
subsequently experienced, they were generally able to project actual future global warming when the 
mismatches between forecast and observed radiative forcings are accounted for. For example, the Scenario B 
presented in Hansen et al. (1988) projected around 50% more warming than has been observed during the 
1988–2017 period, but this is largely because it overestimated subsequent radiative forcings. Similarly, while 
the FAR (IPCC, 1990a) projected a higher rate of global surface temperature warming than has been 
observed, this is largely because it overestimated future greenhouse gas concentrations: the FAR’s projected 
increase in total anthropogenic forcing between 1990 and 2017 was 1.6 W m-2, while the observational 
estimate of actual forcing during that period is 1.1 W m-2 (Dessler and Forster, 2018). Under these actual 
forcings, the change in temperature in the FAR aligns with observations (Hausfather et al., 2020). 
 
<figref>1.9</figref>
 
In addition to global surface temperature, past regional projections can be evaluated. For example, the FAR 
presented a series of temperature projections for 1990 to 2030 for several regions around the world. Regional 
projections were given for a best global warming estimate of 1.8°C since 1850-1900 by 2030, and were 
assigned low confidence. The FAR also suggested that regional temperature changes should be scaled by -
30% to +50% to account for the uncertainty in projected global warming.  
 
The regional projections presented in the FAR are compared to the observed temperature change in the 
period since 1990 (Figure 1.10), following Grose et al. (2017). Subsequent observed temperature change has 
tracked within the FAR projected range for the best estimate of regional warming in the Sahel, South Asia 
and Southern Europe. Temperature change has tracked at or below this range for the Central North America 
and Australia, yet remains within the range reduced by 30% to generate the FAR’s lower global warming 
estimate, consistent with the smaller observed estimate of radiative forcing compared to the FAR central 
estimate. Note that the projections assessed in Chapter 4 of AR6 WGI suggest that global temperatures will 
be around 1.2°C–1.8°C above 1850–1900 by 2030, also lower than the FAR central estimate. 
 
Overall, there is medium confidence that past projections of global temperature are consistent with 
subsequent observations, especially when accounting for the difference in radiative forcings used and those 
which actually occurred (limited evidence, high agreement). FAR regional projections are broadly consistent 
with subsequent observations, allowing for regional-scale climate variability and differences in projected and 
actual forcings. There is medium confidence that the spatial warming pattern has been reliably projected in 
past IPCC reports (limited evidence, high agreement).

# 1.4  AR6 foundations and concepts 
 
AR6 WGI builds on previous assessments using well established foundations and concepts. This section 
highlights some of the cross-cutting methods applied in the climate change literature and topics discussed 
repeatedly throughout this report. The choices related to baseline, or reference periods, are first highlighted 
(Section 1.4.1), including a specific discussion on the pre-industrial baseline used in AR6 WGI (Cross-
Chapter Box 1.2). The relationships between long-term trends, climate variability and the concept of 
emergence of changes (Section 1.4.2) and the sources of uncertainty in climate simulations (Section 1.4.3) 
are discussed next. The topic of low-likelihood outcomes, storylines, abrupt changes and surprises follows 
(Section 1.4.4), including a description of the AR6 WGI risk framing (Cross-Chapter Box 1.3). The Cross-
Working Group Box: Attribution describes attribution methods, including those for extreme events. Various 
sets of geographical regions used in later Chapters are also defined and introduced (Section 1.4.5). 
 
 
## 1.4.1  Baselines, reference periods and anomalies 
 
Several ‘baselines’ or ‘reference periods’ are used consistently throughout AR6 WGI. Baseline refers to a 
period against which differences are calculated whereas reference period is used more generally to indicate a 
time period of interest, or a period over which some relevant statistics are calculated (see Annex VII: 
Glossary). Variations in observed and simulated climate variables over time are often presented as 
‘anomalies’, i.e., the differences relative to a baseline, rather than using the absolute values. This is done for 
several reasons.  
 
First, anomalies are often used when combining data from multiple locations, because the absolute values 
can vary over small spatial scales which are not densely observed or simulated, whereas anomalies are 
representative for much larger scales (e.g., for temperature, Hansen and Lebedeff 1987). Since their baseline 
value is zero by definition, anomalies are also less susceptible to biases arising from changes in the 
observational network. Second, the seasonality in different climate indicators can be removed using 
anomalies to more clearly distinguish variability from long-term trends.  
 
Third, different datasets can have different absolute values for the same climate variable that should be 
removed for effective comparisons of variations with time. This is often required when comparing climate 
simulations with each other, or when comparing simulations with observations, as simulated climate 
variables are also affected by model bias that can be removed when they are presented as anomalies. It can 
also be required when comparing observational datasets or reanalyses (see Section 1.5.2) with each other, 
due to systematic differences in the underlying measurement system (see Figure 1.11). Understanding the 
reasons for any absolute difference is important, but whether the simulated absolute value matters when 
projecting future change will depend on the variable of interest. For example, there is not a strong 
relationship between climate sensitivity of a model (which is an indicator of the degree of future warming) 
and the simulated absolute global surface temperature (Mauritsen et al. 2012; Hawkins and Sutton 2016). 
 
For some variables, such as precipitation, anomalies are often expressed as percentages in order to more 
easily compare changes in regions with very different climatological means. However, for situations where 
there are important thresholds (e.g., phase transitions around 0°C) or for variables which can only take a 
particular sign or be in a fixed range (e.g., sea ice extent or relative humidity), absolute values are normally 
used.  
 
The choice of a baseline period has important consequences for evaluating both observations and simulations 
of the climate, for comparing observations with simulations, and for presenting climate projections. There is 
usually no perfect choice of baseline as many factors have to be considered and compromises may be 
required (Hawkins and Sutton 2016). It is important to evaluate the sensitivity of an analysis or assessment to 
the choice of the baseline.  
 
For example, the collocation of observations and reanalyses within the model ensemble spread depends on 
the choice of the baseline, and uncertainty in future projections of climate is reduced if using a more recent 
baseline, especially for the near-term (Figure 1.11). The length of an appropriate baseline or reference period 
depends on the variable being considered, the rates of change of the variable and the purpose of the period, 
but is usually 20 to 50 years long. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) uses 30-year periods to 
define ‘climate normals’, which indicate conditions expected to be experienced in a given location. 
 
<figref>1.11</figref>
 
For AR6 WGI, the period 1995–2014 is used as a baseline to calculate the changes in future climate using 
model projections and also as a ‘modern’ or ‘recent past’ reference period when estimating past observed 
warming. The equivalent period in AR5 was 1986–2005, and in SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL it was 2006–2015. The primary reason for the different choice in AR6 is that 2014 is the final year of the historical 
CMIP6 simulations. These simulations subsequently assume different emission scenarios and so choosing 
any later baseline end date would require selecting a particular emissions scenario. For certain assessments, 
the most recent decade possible (e.g. 2010–2019 or 2011–2020, depending on the availability of 
observations) is also used as a reference period (see Cross Chapter Box 2.3 in Chapter 2).  
 
Figure 1.12 shows changes in observed global mean surface temperature (GMST) relative to 1850–1900 and 
illustrates observed global warming levels for a range of reference periods that are either used in AR6 or 
were used in previous IPCC Reports. This allows changes to be calculated between different periods and 
compared to previous assessments. For example, AR5 assessed the change in GMST from the 1850–1900 
baseline to 1986–2005 reference period as 0.61 (0.55–0.67) °C, whereas it is now assessed to be 0.69 (0.52–
0.82) °C using improved GMST datasets (also see Cross-Chapter Box 2.3 in Chapter 2).  
 
The commonly used metric for global surface warming tends to be global mean surface temperature (GMST) 
but, as shown in Figure 1.11, climate model simulations tend to use global surface air temperature (GSAT). 
Although GMST and GSAT are closely related, the two measures are physically distinct. GMST is a 
combination of land surface air temperatures (LSAT) and sea surface temperatures (SSTs), whereas GSAT is 
surface air temperatures over land, ocean and ice. A key development in AR6 is the assessment that long-
term changes in GMST and GSAT differ by at most 10% in either direction, with low confidence in the sign 
of any differences (see Cross Chapter Box 2.3 for details).  
 
Three future reference periods are used in AR6 WGI for presenting projections: near-term (2021–2040), 
mid-term (2041–2060) and long-term (2081–2100) (see Figure 1.11). In AR6, 20-year reference periods are 
considered long enough to show future changes in many variables when averaging over ensemble members 
of multiple models, and short enough to enable the time dependence of changes to be shown throughout the 
21st century. Projections with alternative recent baselines (such as 1986–2005 or the current WMO climate 
normal period of 1981–2010) and a wider range of future reference periods are presented in the Interactive 
Atlas. Note that ‘long-term’ is also sometimes used to refer to durations of centuries to millennia when 
examining past climate, as well as future climate change beyond the year 2100. Cross-Chapter Box 2.1 in 
Chapter 2 discusses the paleo reference periods used in AR6.

## 1.4.2  Variability and emergence of the climate change signal 
 
Climatic changes since the pre-industrial era are a combination of long-term anthropogenic changes and 
natural variations on time scales from days to decades. The relative importance of these two factors depends 
on the climate variable or region of interest. Natural variations consist of both natural radiatively forced 
trends (e.g. due to volcanic eruptions or solar variations) and ‘internal’ fluctuations of the climate system 
which occur even in the absence of any radiative forcings. The internal ‘modes of variability’, such as ENSO 
and the NAO, are discussed further in Annex IV. 
 

### 1.4.2.1  Climate variability can influence trends over short periods 
 
Natural variations in both weather and longer timescale phenomena can temporarily obscure or intensify any 
anthropogenic trends (e.g., Deser et al., 2012; Kay et al., 2015). These effects are more important on small 
spatial and temporal scales but can also occur on the global scale as well (see Cross-Chapter Box 3.1in 
Chapter 3).  
 
Since AR5, many studies have examined the role of internal variability through the use of ‘large ensembles’. 
Each such ensemble consists of many different simulations by a single climate model for the same time 
period and using the same radiative forcings. These simulations differ only in their phasing of the internal 
climate variations (also see Section 1.5.4.2). A set of illustrative examples using one such large ensemble 
(Maher et al., 2019) demonstrates how variability can influence trends on decadal timescales (Figure 1.13). 
The long-term anthropogenic trends in this set of climate indicators are clearly apparent when considering 
the ensemble as a whole (grey shading), and all the individual ensemble members have very similar trends 
for ocean heat content (OHC), which is a robust estimate of the total energy stored in the climate system 
(e.g., Palmer and McNeall, 2014). However, the individual ensemble members can exhibit very different 
decadal trends in global surface air temperature (GSAT), UK summer temperatures, and Arctic sea-ice 
variations. More specifically, for a representative 11-year period, both positive and negative trends can be 
found in all these surface indicators, even though the long-term trend is for increasing temperatures and 
decreasing sea ice. Periods in which the long-term trend is substantially obscured or intensified for more than 
20 years are also visible in these regional examples, highlighting that observations are expected to exhibit 
short-term trends which are larger or smaller than the long-term trend or differ from the average projected 
trend from climate models, especially on continental spatial scales or smaller (see Cross Chapter Box 3.1 in 
Chapter 3). The actual observed trajectory can be considered as one realisation of many possible alternative 
worlds which experienced different weather, as also demonstrated by the construction of ‘observation-based 
large ensembles’ that are alternate possible realisations of historical observations, which retain the statistical 
properties of observed regional weather (e.g., McKinnon and Deser, 2018). 
 
<figref>1.13</figref>
 
### 1.4.2.2  The emergence of the climate change signal 
 
In the 1930s it was noted that temperatures were increasing at both local and global scales (Kincer, 1933; 
Callendar, 1938; Figure 1.8). At the time it was unclear whether the observed changes were part of a longer-
term trend or a natural fluctuation; the ‘signal’ had not yet clearly emerged from the ‘noise’ of natural 
variability. Numerous studies have since focused on the emergence of changes in temperature using 
instrumental observations (e.g., Madden and Ramanathan, 1980; Wigley and Jones, 1981; Mahlstein et al., 
2011, 2012; Lehner and Stocker, 2015; Lehner et al., 2017) and paleo-temperature data (e.g., Abram et al., 
2016). 
 
Since the IPCC Third’s Assessment report in 2001, the observed signal of climate change has been 
unequivocally detected at the global scale (see Section 1.3), and this signal is increasingly emerging from the 
noise of natural variability on smaller spatial scales and in a range of climate variables (see also FAQ1.2). In 
this Report emergence of a climate change signal or trend refers to when a change in climate (the ‘signal’) 
becomes larger than the amplitude of natural or internal variations (defining the ‘noise’). This concept is 
often expressed as a ‘signal to-noise’ ratio (S/N) and emergence occurs at a defined threshold of this ratio 
(e.g. S/N > 1 or 2). Emergence can be estimated using observations and/or model simulations and can refer 
to changes relative to a historical or modern baseline (see Chapter 12, Section 12.5.2, Annex VII: Glossary). 
The concept can also be expressed in terms of time (the ‘time of emergence’; Annex VII: Glossary) or in 
terms of a global warming level (Kirchmeier‐ Young et al., 2019; see Chapter 11, Section 11.2.5) and is also 
used to refer to a time when we can expect to see a response of mitigation activities that reduce emissions of 
greenhouse gases or enhance their sinks (emergence with respect to mitigation, see Chapter 4, Section 
4.6.3.1). Whenever possible, emergence should be discussed in the context of a clearly defined level of S/N 
or other quantification, such as ‘the signal has emerged at the level of S/N > 2’, rather than as a simple 
binary statement. For an extended discussion, see Chapter 10 (Section 10.4.3).  
 
Related to the concept of emergence is the detection of change (see Chapter 3). Detection of change is 
defined as the process of demonstrating that some aspect of the climate or a system affected by climate has 
changed in some defined statistical sense, often using spatially aggregating methods that try to maximise 
S/N, such as ‘fingerprints’ (e.g., Hegerl et al., 1996), without providing a reason for that change. An 
identified change is detected in observations if its likelihood of occurrence by chance due to internal 
variability alone is determined to be small, for example, <10% (Annex VII: Glossary).  
 
An example of observed emergence in surface air temperatures is shown in Figure 1.14. Both the largest 
changes in temperature and the largest amplitude of year-to-year variations are observed in the Arctic, with 
lower latitudes showing less warming and smaller year-to-year variations. For the six example regions 
shown (Figure 1.14), the emergence of changes in temperature is more apparent in northern South America, 
East Asia and central Africa, than for northern North America or northern Europe. This pattern was predicted 
by Hansen et al. (1988) and noted in subsequent observations by Mahlstein et al. (2011) (see Chapter 10, 
Section 10.3.4.3, Chapter 12, Section 12.5.2). Overall, tropical regions show earlier emergence of 
temperature changes than at higher latitudes (high confidence). 
 
Since AR5, the emergence of projected future changes has also been extensively examined, in variables 
including surface air temperature (Hawkins and Sutton, 2012; Kirtman et al., 2013; Tebaldi and 
Friedlingstein, 2013), ocean temperatures and salinity (Banks and Wood, 2002), mean precipitation (Giorgi 
and Bi, 2009; Maraun, 2013), drought (Orlowsky and Seneviratne, 2013), extremes (Diffenbaugh and 
Scherer, 2011; Fischer et al., 2014; King et al., 2015; Schleussner and Fyson, 2020), and regional sea level 
change (Lyu et al., 2014). The concept has also been applied to climate change impacts such as effects on 
crop growing regions (Rojas et al., 2019). In AR6, the emergence of oceanic signals such as regional sea 
level change and changes in water mass properties is assessed in Chapter 9 (Section 9.6.1.4), emergence of 
future regional changes is assed in Chapter 10 (Section 10.4.3), the emergence of extremes as a function of 
global warming levels is assessed in Chapter 11 (Section 11.2.5) and the emergence of climatic impact-
drivers for AR6 regions and many climate variables is assessed in Chapter 12 (Section 12.5.2). 
 
Although the magnitude of any change is important, regions which have a larger signal of change relative to 
the background variations will potentially face greater risks than other regions, as they will see unusual or 
novel climate conditions more quickly (Frame et al., 2017). As in Figure 1.14, the signal of temperature 
change is often smaller in tropical countries, but their lower amplitude of variability means they may 
experience the effects of climate change earlier than the mid-latitudes. In addition, these tropical countries 
are often amongst the most exposed, due to large populations (Lehner and Stocker, 2015), and often more 
vulnerable (Harrington et al., 2016; Harrington and Otto, 2018; Russo et al., 2019); both of these factors 
increase the risk from climate-related impacts (Cross Chapter Box 1.3). The rate of change is also important 
for many hazards (e.g., Loarie et al., 2009). Providing more information about changes and variations on 
regional scales, and the associated attribution to particular causes (see Cross-Working Group Box: 
Attribution), is therefore important for adaptation planning.

## 1.4.3  Sources of uncertainty in climate simulations 
 
When evaluating and analysing simulations of the physical climate system, several different sources of 
uncertainty need to be considered (e.g., Hawkins and Sutton, 2009; Lehner et al., 2020). Broadly, these 
sources are: uncertainties in radiative forcings (both those observed in the past and those projected for the 
future); uncertainty in the climate response to particular radiative forcings; internal and natural variations of 
the climate system (which may be somewhat predictable) and interactions among these sources of 
uncertainty.  
 
Ensembles of climate simulations (see Section 1.5.4.2), such as those produced as part of the sixth phase of 
the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), can be used to explore these different sources of 
uncertainty and estimate their magnitude. Relevant experiments with climate models include both historical 
simulations constrained by past radiative forcings and projections of future climate which are constrained by 
specified drivers, such as GHG concentrations, emissions, or radiative forcings. (The term ‘prediction’ is 
usually reserved for estimates of the future climate state which are also constrained by the observed initial 
conditions of the climate system, analogous to a weather forecast.) 
 
 
### 1.4.3.1  Sources of uncertainty 
 
*Radiative forcing uncertainty*  
Future radiative forcing is uncertain due to as-yet-unknown societal choices that will determine future 
anthropogenic emissions; this is considered ‘scenario uncertainty’. The RCP and SSP scenarios, which form 
the basis for climate projections assessed in this report, are designed to span a plausible range of future 
pathways (see Section 1.6) and can be used to estimate the magnitude of scenario uncertainty, but the real 
world may also differ from any one of these example pathways.  
 
Uncertainties also exist regarding past emissions and radiative forcings. These are especially important for 
simulations of paleoclimate time periods, such as the Pliocene, Last Glacial Maximum or the last 
millennium, but are also relevant for the CMIP historical simulations of the instrumental period since 1850. 
In particular, historical radiative forcings due to anthropogenic and natural aerosols are less well constrained 
by observations than the greenhouse gas radiative forcings. There is also uncertainty in the size of large 
volcanic eruptions (and in the location for some that occurred before around 1850), and the amplitude of 
changes in solar activity, before satellite observations. The role of historical radiative forcing uncertainty was 
considered previously (Knutti et al., 2002; Forster et al., 2013) but, since AR5, specific simulations have 
been performed to examine this issue, particularly for the effects of uncertainty in anthropogenic aerosol 
radiative forcing (e.g., Jiménez-de-la-Cuesta and Mauritsen, 2019; Dittus et al., 2020).  
 
*Climate response uncertainty*  
Under any particular scenario (see Section 1.6.1), there is uncertainty in how the climate will respond to the 
specified emissions or radiative forcing combinations. A range of climate models is often used to estimate 
the range of uncertainty in our understanding of the key physical processes and to define the ‘model response 
uncertainty’ (see Section 1.5.4 and Chapter 4, Section 4.2.5). However, this range does not necessarily 
represent the full ‘climate response uncertainty’ in how the climate may respond to a particular radiative 
forcing or emissions scenario. This is because, for example, the climate models used in CMIP experiments 
have structural uncertainties not explored in a typical multi-model exercise (e.g., Murphy et al., 2004) and 
are not entirely independent of each other (Masson and Knutti, 2011; Abramowitz et al., 2019; see Section 
1.5.4.8); there are small spatial-scale features which cannot be resolved; and long time-scale processes or 
tipping points are not fully represented. Section 1.4.4 discusses how some of these issues can still be 
considered in a risk assessment context. For some metrics, such as Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS), 
the CMIP6 model range is found to be broader than the very likely range assessed by combining multiple 
lines of evidence (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3.4 and Chapter 7, Section 7.5.6). 
 
*Natural and internal climate variations*  
Even without any anthropogenic radiative forcing, there would still be uncertainty in projecting future 
climate because of unpredictable natural factors such as variations in solar activity and volcanic eruptions. 
For projections of future climate, such as those presented in Chapter 4, the uncertainty in these factors is not 
normally considered. However, the potential effects on the climate of large volcanic eruptions (Cross-
Chapter Box 4.1in Chapter 4, Zanchettin et al., 2016; Bethke et al., 2017) and large solar variations (Feulner 
and Rahmstorf, 2010; Maycock et al., 2015) are studied. On longer timescales, orbital effects and plate 
tectonics also play a role. 
 
Further, even in the absence of any anthropogenic or natural changes in radiative forcing, Earth’s climate 
fluctuates on timescales from days to decades or longer. These ‘internal’ variations, such as those associated 
with modes of variability (e.g., ENSO, Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV), or Atlantic Multi-decadal 
Variability (AMV) – see Annex IV) are unpredictable on timescales longer than a few years ahead and are a 
source of uncertainty for understanding how the climate might become in a particular decade, especially 
regionally. The increased use of ‘large ensembles’ of complex climate model simulations to sample this 
component of uncertainty is discussed above in Section 1.4.2.1 and further in Chapter 4. 
 
*Interactions between variability and radiative forcings*  
It is plausible that there are interactions between radiative forcings and climate variations, such as influences 
on the phasing or amplitude of internal or natural climate variability (Zanchettin, 2017). For example, the 
timing of volcanic eruptions may influence Atlantic multi-decadal variability (e.g., Otterå et al., 2010; Birkel 
et al., 2018) or ENSO (e.g., Maher et al., 2015; Khodri et al., 2017; Zuo et al., 2018), and anthropogenic 
aerosols may influence decadal modes of variability in the Pacific (e.g., Smith et al., 2016). In addition, 
melting of glaciers and ice caps due to anthropogenic influences has been speculated to increase volcanic 
activity (e.g., a specific example for Iceland is discussed in Swindles et al., 2018). 
 
 
### 1.4.3.2  Uncertainty quantification 
 
Not all of these listed sources of uncertainty are of the same type. For example, internal climate variations 
are an intrinsic uncertainty that can be estimated probabilistically, and could be more precisely quantified, 
but cannot usually be reduced. However, advances in decadal prediction offer the prospect of narrowing 
uncertainties in the trajectory of the climate for a few years ahead (e.g., Meehl et al., 2014; Yeager and 
Robson, 2017; Chapter 4, Section 4.2.3).  
 
Other sources of uncertainty, such as model response uncertainty, can in principle be reduced, but are not 
amenable to a frequency-based interpretation of probability, and Bayesian methods to quantify the 
uncertainty have been considered instead (e.g., Tebaldi, 2004; Rougier, 2007; Sexton et al., 2012). The 
scenario uncertainty component is distinct from other uncertainties, given that future anthropogenic 
emissions can be considered as the outcome of a set of societal choices (see Section 1.6.1).  
 
For climate model projections it is possible to approximately quantify the relative amplitude of various 
sources of uncertainty (e.g., Hawkins and Sutton, 2009; Lehner et al., 2020). A range of different climate 
models are used to estimate the model response uncertainty to a particular emissions pathway, and multiple 
pathways are used to estimate the scenario uncertainty. The unforced component of internal variability can 
be estimated from individual ensemble members of the same climate model (e.g., Deser et al., 2012; Maher 
et al., 2019; Section 1.5.4.8).  
 
Figure 1.15 illustrates the relative size of these different uncertainty components using a ‘cascade of 
uncertainty’ (Wilby and Dessai, 2010), with examples shown for global mean temperature, northern South 
American annual temperatures and East Asian summer precipitation changes. For global mean temperature, 
the role of internal variability is small, and the total uncertainty is dominated by emissions scenario and 
model response uncertainties. Note that there is considerable overlap between individual simulations for 
different emissions scenarios even for the mid-term (2041–2060). For example, the slowest-warming 
simulation for SSP5-8.5 produces less mid-term warming than the fastest-warming simulation for SSP1-1.9. 
For the long-term, emissions scenario uncertainty becomes dominant.  
 
The relative uncertainty due to internal variability and model uncertainty increases for smaller spatial scales. 
In the regional example shown for changes in temperature, the same scenario and model combination has 
produced two simulations which differ by 1°C in their projected 2081–2100 averages due solely to internal 
climate variability. For regional precipitation changes, emissions scenario uncertainty is often small relative 
to model response uncertainty. In the example shown, the SSPs overlap considerably, but SSP1-1.9 shows 
the largest precipitation change in the near-term even though global mean temperature warms the least; this 
is due to differences between regional aerosol emissions projected in this and other scenarios (Wilcox et al., 
2020). These cascades of uncertainty would branch out further if applying the projections to derive estimates 
of changes in hazard (e.g., Wilby and Dessai, 2010; Halsnæs and Kaspersen, 2018; Hattermann et al., 2018).

## 1.4.4  Considering an uncertain future 
 
Since AR5 there have been developments in how to consider and describe future climate outcomes which are 
considered possible but very unlikely, highly uncertain, or potentially surprising. To examine such futures 
there is a need to move beyond the usual ‘likely’ or ‘very likely’ assessed ranges and consider low-likelihood 
outcomes, especially those that would result in significant impacts if they occurred (e.g., Sutton, 2018; 
Sillmann et al., 2021). This section briefly outlines some of the different approaches used in the AR6 WGI. 
 
### 1.4.4.1  Low-likelihood outcomes 
 
In the AR6, certain low-likelihood outcomes are described and assessed because they may be associated with 
high levels of risk and the greatest risks may not be associated with the most expected outcome. The aim of 
assessing these possible futures is to better inform risk assessment and decision making. Two types are 
considered: (1) low-likelihood high warming (LLHW) scenarios, which describe the climate in a world with 
very high climate sensitivity, and (2) low-likelihood high impact (LLHI) events that have a low likelihood of 
occurring, but would cause large potential impacts on society or ecosystems.  
 
An illustrative example of how low-likelihood outcomes can produce significant additional risks is shown in 
Figure 1.16. The Reasons for Concern (RFCs) produced by the IPCC AR5 WGII define the additional risks 
due to climate change at different global warming levels. These have been combined with Chapter 4 
assessments of projected global temperature for different emissions scenarios (SSPs; see Section 1.6), and 
Chapter 7 assessments about ECS. For example, even following a medium emissions scenario could result in 
high levels of additional risk if ECS is at the upper end of the very likely range. However, not all possible 
low-likelihood outcomes relate to ECS, and AR6 considers these issues in more detail than previous IPCC 
assessment reports (see Table 1.1 and below for some examples). 
 
<figref>1.16</figref>
 
 
### 1.4.4.2  Storylines 
 
As societies are increasingly experiencing the impacts of climate change related events, the climate science 
community is developing climate information tailored for particular regions and sectors. There is a growing 
focus on explaining and exploring complex physical chains of events or on predicting climate under various 
future socio-economic developments. Since AR5, ‘storylines’ or ‘narratives’ approaches have been used to 
better inform risk assessment and decision making, to assist understanding of regional processes, and 
represent and communicate climate projection uncertainties more clearly. The aim is to help build a cohesive 
overall picture of potential climate change pathways that moves beyond the presentation of data and figures 
(Annex VII: Glossary; Fløttum and Gjerstad, 2017; Moezzi et al., 2017; Dessai et al., 2018; Shepherd et al., 
2018b). 
 
In the broader IPCC context, the term ‘scenario storyline’ refers to a narrative description of one or more 
scenarios, highlighting their main characteristics, relationships between key driving forces and the dynamics 
of their evolution (for example, short-lived climate forcers emissions assessed in Chapter 6 are driven by 
‘scenario storylines’, see Section 1.6). WGI is mainly concerned with ‘physical climate storylines’. These are 
self-consistent and possible unfolding of a physical trajectory of the climate system, or a weather or climate 
event, on timescales from hours to multiple decades (Shepherd et al., 2018b). This approach can be used to 
constrain projected changes or specific events on specified explanatory elements such as projected changes 
of large-scale indicators (Chapter 10, Box 10.2). For example, Hazeleger et al. (2015) suggested using ‘tales 
of future weather’, blending numerical weather prediction with a climate projection to illustrate the potential 
behaviour of future high-impact events (also see Hegdahl et al. 2020). Several studies describe how possible 
large changes in atmospheric circulation would affect regional precipitation and other climate variables, and 
discuss the various climate drivers which could cause such a circulation response (James et al., 2015; Zappa 
and Shepherd, 2017; Mindlin et al., 2020). Physical climate storylines can also help frame the causal factors 
of extreme weather events (Shepherd, 2016) and then be linked to event attribution (Chapter 11, Section 11.2.2; Cross Working Group Box: Attribution).  
 
Storyline approaches can be used to communicate and contextualise climate change information in the 
context of risk for policymakers and practitioners (e.g., de Bruijn et al., 2016; Dessai et al., 2018; Scott et al., 
2018; Jack et al., 2020; Chapter 10, Box 10.2). They can also help in assessing risks associated with LLHI 
events (Weitzman, 2011; Sutton, 2018), because they consider the ‘physically self-consistent unfolding of 
past events, or of plausible future events or pathways’ (Shepherd et al., 2018b), which would be masked in a 
probabilistic approach. These aspects are important as the greatest risk need not be associated with the 
highest-likelihood outcome, and in fact will often be associated with low-likelihood outcomes. The storyline 
approach can also acknowledge that climate-relevant decisions in a risk-oriented framing will rarely be taken 
on the basis of physical climate change alone; instead, such decisions will normally take into account socio-
economic factors as well (Shepherd, 2019).  
 
In the AR6 WGI Assessment Report, these different storyline approaches are used in several places (see 
Table 1.1). Chapter 4 uses a storyline approach to assess the upper tail of the distribution of global warming 
levels (the storylines of high global warming levels) and their manifestation in global patterns of temperature 
and precipitation changes. Chapter 9 uses a storyline approach to examine the potential for, and early 
warning signals of, a high-end sea-level scenario, in the context of deep uncertainty related to our current 
understanding the physical processes that contribute to long-term sea-level rise. Chapter 10 assesses the use 
of physical climate storylines and narratives as a way to explore uncertainties in regional climate projections, 
and to link to the specific risk and decision context relevant to a user, for developing integrated and context-
relevant regional climate change information. Chapter 11 uses the term storyline in the framework of 
extreme event attribution. Chapter 12 assesses the use of a storylines approach with narrative elements for 
communicating climate (change) information in the context of climate services (Cross-Chapter Box 12.2 in 
Chapter 12).

### 1.4.4.3  Abrupt change, tipping points and surprises 
 
An abrupt change is defined in this report as a change that takes place substantially faster than the rate of 
change in the recent history of the affected component of a system (see Annex VII: Glossary). In some cases, 
abrupt change occurs because the system state actually becomes unstable, such that the subsequent rate of 
change is independent of the forcing. We refer to this class of abrupt change as a tipping point, defined as a 
critical threshold beyond which a system reorganizes, often abruptly and/or irreversibly (Lenton et al., 2008); 
Annex VII: Glossary). Some of the abrupt climate changes and climate tipping points discussed in this report 
could have severe local climate responses, such as extreme temperature, droughts, forest fires, ice sheet loss 
and collapse of the thermohaline circulation (see Chapter 4, Section 4.7.2, Chapter 5, Section 5.4.9, Chapter 
8, Section 8.6 and Chapter 9, Section 9.2.3). 
 
There is evidence of abrupt change in Earth’s history, and some of these events have been interpreted as 
tipping points (Dakos et al., 2008) . Some of these are associated with significant changes in the global 
climate, such as deglaciations in the Quaternary (past 2.5 million years) and rapid warming at the 
Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (around 55.5 million years ago) (Bowen et al., 2015; Hollis et al., 
2019). Such events changed the planetary climate for tens to hundreds of thousands of years, but at a rate 
that is actually much slower than projected anthropogenic climate change over this century, even in the 
absence of tipping points. 
 
Such paleoclimate evidence has even fuelled concerns that anthropogenic GHGs could tip the global climate 
into a permanent hot state (Steffen et al., 2018). However, there is no evidence of such non-linear responses 
at the global scale in climate projections for the next century, which indicate a near-linear dependence of 
global temperature on cumulative GHG emissions (Section 1.3.5, Chapter 5, Section 5.5 and Chapter 7, 
Section 7.4.3.1). At the regional scale, abrupt changes and tipping points, such as Amazon forest dieback and 
permafrost collapse, have occurred in projections with Earth System Models (Drijfhout et al., 2015; Bathiany 
et al., 2020; Chapter 4, Section 4.7.3). In such simulations, tipping points occur in narrow regions of 
parameter space (e.g., CO2 concentration or temperature increase), and for specific climate background 
states. This makes them difficult to predict using ESMs relying on parmeterizations of known processes. In 
some cases, it is possible to detect forthcoming tipping points through time-series analysis that identifies 
increased sensitivity to perturbations as the tipping point is approached (e.g., ‘critical slowing-down’, 
Scheffer et al., 2012).  
 
Some suggested climate tipping points prompt transitions from one steady state to another (see Figure 1.17). 
Transitions can be prompted by perturbations such as climate extremes which force the system outside of its 
current well of attraction in the stability landscape; this is called noise-induced tipping (Ashwin et al., 2012; 
Figure 1.17, panels a/b). For example, the tropical forest dieback seen in some ESM projections is 
accelerated by longer and more frequent droughts over tropical land (Good et al., 2013).  
 
Alternatively, transitions from one state to another can occur if a critical threshold is exceeded; this is called 
bifurcation tipping (Ashwin et al., 2012; Figure 1.17, panels c/d). The new state is defined as irreversible on 
a given timescale if the recovery from this state takes substantially longer than the timescale of interest, 
which is decades to centuries for the projections presented in this report. A well-known example is the 
modelled irreversibility of the ocean’s thermohaline circulation in response to North Atlantic changes such 
as freshwater input from rainfall and ice-sheet melt (Rahmstorf et al., 2005; Alkhayuon et al., 2019), which 
is assessed in detail in Chapter 9, Section 9.2.3. 
 
The tipping point concept is most commonly framed for systems in which the forcing changes relatively 
slowly. However, this is not the case for most scenarios of anthropogenic forcing projected for the 21st 
century. Systems with inertia lag behind rapidly-increasing forcing, which can lead to the failure of early 
warning signals or even the possibility of temporarily overshooting a bifurcation point without provoking 
tipping (Ritchie et al., 2019). 
 
<figref>1.17</figref> 
 
Surprises are a class of risk that can be defined as low-likelihood but well-understood events, and events that 
cannot be predicted with current understanding. The risk from such surprises can be accounted for in risk 
assessments (Parker and Risbey, 2015). Examples relevant to climate science include: a series of major 
volcanic eruptions or a nuclear war, either of which would cause substantial planetary cooling (Robock et al., 
2007; Mills et al., 2014); significant 21st century sea level rise due to marine ice sheet instability (MISI, 
Chapter 9, Box 9.4); the potential for collapse of the stratocumulus cloud decks (Schneider et al., 2019) or 
other substantial changes in climate feedbacks (see Chapter 7, Section 7.4); and unexpected biological 
epidemics among humans or other species, such as the COVID-19 pandemic (Forster et al., 2020; Le Quéré 
et al., 2020; see Cross-Chapter Box 6.1 in Chapter 6). The discovery of the ozone hole was also a surprise 
even though some of the relevant atmospheric chemistry was known at the time. The term ‘unknown 
unknowns’ (Parker and Risbey, 2015) is also sometimes used in this context to refer to events that cannot be 
anticipated with present knowledge or were of an unanticipated nature before they occurred.

## 1.4.5  Climate regions used in AR6 
 
### 1.4.5.1  Defining climate regions 
 
AR5 assessed regional scale detection and attribution and assessed key regional climate phenomena and their 
relevance for future regional climate projections. This report shows that past and future climate changes and 
extreme weather events can be substantial on local and regional scales (Chapters 8–12, Atlas), where they 
may differ considerably from global trends, not only in intensity but even in sign (e.g., Fischer et al., 2013).  
 
Although the evolution of global climate trends emerges as the net result of regional phenomena, average or 
aggregate estimates often do not reflect the intensity, variability, and complexity of regional climate changes 
(Stammer et al., 2018; Shepherd, 2019). A fundamental aspect of the study of regional climate changes is the 
definition of characteristic climate zones, clusters or regions, across which the emergent climate change 
signal can be properly analysed and projected (see Atlas). Suitable sizes and shapes of such zones strongly 
depend not only on the climate variable and process of interest, but also on relevant multiscale feedbacks.  
 
There are several approaches to the classification of climate regions. When climate observation data was 
sparse and limited, the aggregation of climate variables was implicitly achieved through the consideration of 
biomes, giving rise to the traditional vegetation-based classification of Köppen (1936). In the last decades, 
the substantial increases in climate observations, climate modelling, and data processing capabilities have 
allowed new approaches to climate classification, e.g., through interpolation of aggregated global data from 
thousands of stations (Peel et al., 2007; Belda et al., 2014; Beck et al., 2018a) or through data-driven 
approaches applied to delineate ecoregions that behave in a coherent manner in response to climate 
variability (Papagiannopoulou et al., 2018). Experience shows that each method has strengths and 
weaknesses through trade-offs between detail and convenience. For instance, a very detailed classification, 
with numerous complexly shaped regions derived from a large set of variables, may be most useful for the 
evaluation of climate models (Rubel and Kottek, 2010; Belda et al., 2015; Beck et al., 2018a) and climate 
projections (Feng et al., 2014; Belda et al., 2016). In contrast, geometrically simple regions are often best 
suited for regional climate modelling and downscaling (e.g., the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling 
Experiment (CORDEX) domains; see Giorgi and Gutowski, 2015, and Section 1.5.3).   
 
 
### 1.4.5.2  Types of regions used in AR6 
 
IPCC’s recognition of the importance of regional climates can be traced back to its First Assessment Report 
(IPCC, 1990a), where climate projections for 2030 were presented for five subcontinental regions (see 
Section 1.3.6 for an assessment of those projections). In subsequent reports, there has been a growing 
emphasis on the analysis of regional climate, including two special reports: one on regional impacts (IPCC, 
1998) and another on extreme events (SREX, IPCC, 2012). A general feature of previous IPCC reports is 
that the number and coverage of climate regions vary according to the subject and across WGs. Such varied 
definitions have the advantage of optimizing the results for a particular application (e.g., national boundaries 
are crucial for decision making, but they rarely delimit distinctive climate regions), whereas variable region 
definitions may have the disadvantage of hindering multidisciplinary assessments and comparisons between 
studies or WGs. 
  
In this Report, regional climate change is primarily addressed through the introduction of four classes of 
regions (unless otherwise explicitly mentioned and justified). The first two are the unified WGI Reference 
Sets of (1) Land and (2) Ocean Regions, which are used in the entire Report. These are supplemented by 
additional sets of (3) Typological Regions — used in Chapters 5, 8–12 and Atlas — and (4) Continental 
Regions, which are mainly used for linking Chapters 11, 12 and Atlas with WGII (Figure 1.18). All four 
classes of regions are defined and described in detail in the Atlas. Here we summarize their basic features.  
 
<figref>1.18</figref> 
 
Reference Land and Ocean Regions are polygonal, sub-continental domains defined through a combination 
of environmental, climatic and non-climatic (e.g., pragmatic, technical, historical) factors, in accordance 
with the literature and climatological reasoning based on observed and projected future climate. Merging the 
diverse functions and purposes of the regions assessed in the literature into a common reference set implies a 
certain degree of compromise between simplicity, practicality, and climate consistency. For instance, Spain 
is fully included in the Mediterranean (MED) Reference Region, but is one of the most climatically diverse 
countries in the world. Likewise, a careful comparison of panels (a) and (b) of Figure 1.18) reveals that the 
simplified southern boundary of the Sahara (SAH) Reference Region slightly overlaps the northern boundary 
of the West African Monsoon Typological Region. As such, the resulting Reference Regions are not 
intended to precisely represent climates, but rather to provide simple domains suitable for regional synthesis 
of observed and modelled climate and climate change information (Iturbide et al., 2020). In particular, 
CMIP6 model results averaged over Reference Regions are presented in the Atlas. 
 
The starting point for defining the AR6 Reference Sets of Land Regions was the collection of 26 regions 
introduced in SREX (IPCC, 2012). The SREX collection was then revised, reshaped, complemented and 
optimized to reflect the recent scientific literature and observed climate-change trends, giving rise to the 
novel AR6 reference set of 46 land regions. Additionally, AR6 introduces a new reference set of 15 ocean 
regions (including 3 hybrid regions that are treated as both, land and ocean), which complete the coverage of 
the whole Earth (Iturbide et al., 2020).  
 
Particular aspects of regional climate change are described by specialized domains called Typological 
Regions (Figure 1.18b). These regions cover a wide range of spatial scales and are defined by specific 
features, called typologies. Examples of typologies include: tropical forests, deserts, mountains, monsoon 
regions, and megacities, among others. Typological Regions are powerful tools to summarize complex 
aspects of climate defined by a combination of multiple variables. For this reason, they are used in many 
chapters of AR6 WGI and WGII (e.g., Chapters 8–12 and the Atlas).   
 
Finally, consistency with WGII is also pursued in Chapter 11, 12 and Atlas through the use of a set of 
Continental Regions (Figure 1.18c), based on the nine continental domains defined in AR5 WGII Part B 
(Hewitson et al., 2014). These are classical geopolitical divisions of Africa, Asia, Australasia, Europe, North 
America, Central and South America, plus Small Islands, Polar Regions, and the Ocean. In AR6 WGI, five 
hybrid zones (Caribbean–Small islands, East Europe–Asia, European Arctic, North American Arctic, and 
North Central America) are also identified, which are assessed in more than one continental region. 
Additional consistency with WGIII is pursued by Chapter 6 through the use of sub-continental domains 
which essentially form a subset of the Continental Set of Regions (Figure 1.18c and Chapter 6, Section 6.1). 
 
 
# 1.5  Major developments and their implications 
 
This section presents a selection of key developments since the AR5 of the capabilities underlying the lines 
of evidence used in the present report: observational data and observing systems (Section 1.5.1), new 
developments in reanalyses (Section 1.5.2), climate models (Section 1.5.3), and modelling techniques, 
comparisons and performance assessments (Section 1.5.4). For brevity, we focus on the developments that 
are of particular importance to the conclusions drawn in later chapters, though we also provide an assessment 
of potential losses of climate observational capacity.   
 
 
## 1.5.1  Observational data and observing systems  
 
Progress in climate science relies on the quality and quantity of observations from a range of platforms: 
surface-based instrumental measurements, aircraft, radiosondes and other upper-atmospheric observations, 
satellite-based retrievals, ocean observations, and paleoclimatic records. An historical perspective to these 
types of observations is presented in Section 1.3.1.  
 
Observed large-scale climatic changes assessed in Chapter 2, attribution of these changes in Chapter 3, and 
regional observations of specific physical or biogeochemical processes presented in other Chapters, are 
supported by improvements in observational capacity since the AR5. Attribution assessments can be made at 
a higher likelihood level than AR5, due in part to the availability of longer observational datasets (Chapter 
3). Updated assessments are made based on new and improved datasets, for example of global temperature 
change (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3 in Chapter 2) or regional climate information (Chapter 10, Section 10.2). Of 
particular relevance to the AR6 assessment are the ‘Essential Climate Variables’ (ECVs, Hollmann et al., 
2013; Bojinski et al., 2014), and ‘Essential Ocean Variables’ (EOVs; Lindstrom et al., 2012), compiled by 
the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS; WMO, 2016), and the Global Ocean Observing System 
(GOOS), respectively. These variables include physical, chemical, and biological variables or groups of 
linked variables and underpin ‘headline indicators’ for climate monitoring (Trewin et al., 2021).  
 
We highlight below the key advances in observational capacity since the AR5, including major expansions 
of existing observational platforms as well as new and/or emerging observational platforms that play a key 
role in AR6. We then discuss potential near-term losses in key observational networks due to climate change 
or other adverse human-caused influence.  
 
 
### 1.5.1.1  Major expansions of observational capacity  
 
#### Atmosphere, land and hydrological cycle 
 
Satellites provide observations of a large number of key atmospheric and land surface variables, ensuring 
sustained observations over wide areas. Since AR5, such observations have expanded to include satellite 
retrievals of atmospheric CO2 via the NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory satellites (OCO-2 and OCO-3, 
Eldering et al., 2017), following on from similar efforts employing the Greenhouse Gases Observing 
Satellite (GOSAT, Yokota et al., 2009; Inoue et al., 2016). Improved knowledge of fluxes between the 
atmosphere and land surface results from combining remote sensing and in situ measurements (Rebmann et 
al., 2018). FLUXNET (https://fluxnet.org/) has been providing eddy covariance measurements of carbon, 
water, and energy fluxes between the land and the atmosphere, with some of the stations operating for over 
20 years (Pastorello et al., 2017), while the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) has been 
maintaining high-quality radiation observations since the 1990s (Ohmura et al., 1998; Driemel et al., 2018).  
 
Observations of the composition of the atmosphere have been further improved through expansions of 
existing surface observation networks (Bodeker et al., 2016; De Mazière et al., 2018) and through in situ 
measurements such as aircraft campaigns (Chapter 2, Section 2.2; Chapter 5, Section 5.2; Chapter 6, Section 
6.2). Examples of expanded networks include Aerosols, Clouds, and Trace Gases Research InfraStructure 
(ACTRIS) (Pandolfi et al., 2018), which focuses on short-lived climate forcers, and the Integrated Carbon 
Observation System (ICOS), which allows scientists to study and monitor the global carbon cycle and 
greenhouse gas emissions (Colomb et al., 2018). Examples of recent aircraft observations include the 
Atmospheric Tomography Mission (ATom), which has flown repeatedly along the north-south axis of both 
the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, and the continuation of the In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing 
System (IAGOS) effort, which measures atmospheric composition from commercial aircraft (Petzold et al., 
2015).   
 
Two distinctly different but important remote sensing systems can provide information about temperature 
and humidity since the early 2000s. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (e.g., GPS) radio occultation and 
limb soundings provide information, although only data for the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere are 
suitable to support climate change assessments (Angerer et al., 2017; Scherllin-Pirscher et al., 2017; Steiner 
et al., 2019; Gleisner et al., 2020). These measurements complement those from the Atmospheric Infrared 
Sounder (AIRS; Chahine et al., 2006). AIRS has limitations in cloudy conditions, although these limitations 
have been partly solved using new methods of analysis (Blackwell and Milstein, 2014; Susskind et al., 
2014). These new data sources now have a sufficient length of the record to strengthen the analysis of 
atmospheric warming in Chapter 2, Section 2.3.1.2. 

Assessments of the hydrological cycle in Chapters 2 and 8 are supported by longer time series and new 
developments. Examples are new satellites (McCabe et al., 2017) and measurements of water vapor using 
commercial laser absorption spectrometers and water vapor isotopic composition (Steen-Larsen et al., 2015; 
Zannoni et al., 2019). Data products of higher quality have been developed since AR5, such as the multi-
source weighted ensemble precipitation (Beck et al., 2017), and multi-satellite terrestrial evaporation (Fisher 
et al., 2017). Longer series are available for satellite-derived global inundation (Prigent et al., 2020). 
Observations of soil moisture are now available via the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and the 
Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite retrievals, filling critical gaps in the observation of 
hydrological trends and variability over land (Dorigo et al., 2017). Similarly, the Gravity Recovery and 
Climate Experiment GRACE and GRACE-FO satellites (Tapley et al., 2019) have provided key constraints 
on groundwater variability and trends around the world (Frappart and Ramillien, 2018). The combination of 
new observations with other sources of information has led to updated estimates of heat storage in inland 
waters (Vanderkelen et al., 2020), contributing to revised estimates of heat storage on the continents (von 
Schuckmann et al., 2020; Chapter 7, Section 7.2.2.3).  
 
The ongoing collection of information about the atmosphere as it evolves is supplemented by the 
reconstruction and digitization of data about past conditions. Programs aimed at recovering information from 
sources such as handwritten weather journals and ship logs continue to make progress, and are steadily 
improving spatial coverage and extending our knowledge backward in time. For example, Brönnimann et al. 
(2019) has recently identified several thousand sources of climate data for land areas in the pre-1890 period, 
with many from the 18th century. The vast majority of these data are not yet contained in international 
digital data archives, and substantial quantities of undigitized ship’s weather log data exist for the same 
period (Kaspar et al., 2015). Since the AR5 there has been a growth of ‘citizen science’ activities to rapidly 
transcribe substantial quantities of weather observations involving volunteers. Examples of projects include: 
oldWeather.org, and SouthernWeatherDiscovery.org that both used ship-based logbook sources, and the 
DRAW (Data Rescue: Archival and Weather) project, WeatherRescue.org, JungleWeather.org and the 
Climate History Australia project, which recovered land-based station data from Canada, Europe, the Congo 
and Australia respectively (e.g., Park et al., 2018; Hawkins et al., 2019). Undergraduate students have also 
been recruited to successfully digitise rainfall data in Ireland (Ryan et al., 2018). Such observations are an 
invaluable source of weather and climate information for the early historical period that continues to expand 
the digital archives (e.g., Freeman et al., 2017) which underpin observational datasets used across several 
Chapters. 
 
#### Ocean 
 
Observations of the ocean have expanded significantly since the AR5, with expanded global coverage of in 
situ ocean temperature and salinity observations, in situ ocean biogeochemistry observations, and satellite 
retrievals of a variety of EOVs. Many recent advances are extensively documented in a compilation by Lee 
et al. (2019). Below we discuss those most relevant for the current assessment. 
 
Argo is a global network of nearly 4000 autonomous profiling floats (Roemmich et al., 2019), delivering 
detailed constraints on the horizontal and vertical structure of temperature and salinity across the global 
ocean. Argo has greatly expanded since AR5, including biogeochemistry and measurements deeper than 
2000 m (Jayne et al., 2017), and the longer timeseries enable more rigorous climate assessments of direct 
relevance to estimates of ocean heat content (Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3.1 ; Chapter 7, section 7.2.2.2). Argo 
profiles are complemented by animal-borne sensors in several key areas, such as the seasonally ice-covered 
sectors of the Southern Ocean (Harcourt et al., 2019). 
 
Most basin-scale arrays of moored ocean instruments have expanded since AR5, providing decades-long 
records of the ocean and atmosphere properties relevant for climate, such as the El Niño-Southern 
Oscillation (Chen et al., 2018), deep convection (de Jong et al., 2018) or transports through straits 
(Woodgate, 2018). Key basin-scale arrays include transport-measuring arrays in the Atlantic Ocean, 
continuing (McCarthy et al., 2020) or newly added since AR5 (Lozier et al., 2019), supporting the 
assessment of regional ocean circulation (Chapter 9, section 9.2.3). Tropical ocean moorings in the Pacific, 
Indian and Atlantic oceans include new sites, improved capability for real time transmission, and new 
oxygen and CO2 sensors (Bourlès et al., 2019; Hermes et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2019b).  
 
A decade of observations of sea-surface salinity is now available via the SMOS and SMAP satellite 
retrievals, providing continuous and global monitoring of surface salinity in the open ocean and coastal areas 
for the first time (Vinogradova et al., 2019; Reul et al., 2020) (Chapter 9, Section 9.2.2.2). 
 
The global network of tide gauges, complemented by a growing number of satellite-based altimetry datasets, 
allows for more robust estimates of global and regional sea level rise (Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3.3; Chapter 9, 
Section 9.6.1.3). Incorporating vertical land motion derived from the Global Positioning System (GPS), the 
comparison with tide gauges has allowed the correction of a drift in satellite altimetry series over the period 
1993–1999 (Watson et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2017), thus improving our knowledge of the recent acceleration 
of sea level rise (Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3.3). These datasets, combined with Argo and observations of the 
cryosphere, allow a consistent closure of the global mean sea level budget (Cross-Chapter Box 9.1 in 
Chapter 9; WCRP Global Sea Level Budget, 2018). 
 
#### Cryosphere 
 
For the cryosphere, there has been much recent progress in synthesizing global datasets covering larger areas 
and longer time periods from multi-platform observations. For glaciers, the Global Terrestrial Network for 
Glaciers, which combines data on glacier fluctuations, mass balance and elevation change with glacier 
outlines and ice thickness, has expanded and provided input for assessing global glacier evolution and its 
role in sea level rise (Chapter 2, Section 2.3.2.3; Chapter 9, Section 9.5.1; Zemp et al., 2019). New data 
sources include archived and declassified aerial photographs and satellite missions, and high-resolution (10 
m or less) digital elevation models (Porter et al., 2018; Braun et al., 2019).  
 
Improvements have also been made in the monitoring of permafrost. The Global Terrestrial Network for 
Permafrost (Biskaborn et al., 2015) provides long-term records of permafrost temperature and active layer 
thickness at key sites to assess their changes over time. Substantial improvements to our assessments of 
large-scale snow changes come from intercomparison and blending of several datasets, for snow water 
equivalent (Mortimer et al., 2020) and snow cover extent (Mudryk et al., 2020), and from bias corrections of 
combined datasets using in situ data (Pulliainen et al., 2020; Chapter 2, Section 2.3.2.5; Chapter 9, Section 
9.5.2). 
 
The value of gravity-based estimates of changes in ice sheet mass has increased as the time series from the 
GRACE and GRACE-FO satellites, homogenised and absolutely calibrated, is close to 20 years in length. 
The ESA’s Cryosat-2 radar altimetry satellite mission has continued to provide measurements of the changes 
in the thickness of sea ice and the elevation of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets (Tilling et al., 2018). 
Other missions include NASA’s Operation IceBridge, collecting airborne remote sensing measurements to 
bridge the gap between ICESat (Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite) and the upcoming ICESat-2 laser 
altimetry missions. Longer time series from multiple missions have led to considerable advances in 
understanding the origin of inconsistencies between the mass balances of different glaciers and reducing 
uncertainties in estimates of changes in the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets (Bamber et al., 2018; 
Shepherd et al., 2018a, 2020). Last, the first observed climatology of snowfall over Antarctica was obtained 
using the cloud/precipitation radar onboard NASA’s CloudSat (Palerme et al., 2014). 
 
#### Biosphere 
 
Satellite observations have recently expanded to include data on the fluorescence of land plants as a measure 
of photosynthetic activity via the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (Guanter et al., 2014; Yang et al., 
2015) and OCO-2 satellites (Sun et al., 2017). Climate data records of Leaf Area Index (LAI), characterizing 
the area of green leaves per unit of ground area, and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active 
radiation (FAPAR) – an important indicator of photosynthetic activity and plant health (Gobron et al., 2009) 
– are now available for over 30-years (Claverie et al., 2016). In addition, key indicators such as fire 
disturbances/burned areas are now retrieved via satellite (Chuvieco et al., 2019). In the US, the National 
Ecological Observational Network (NEON) provides continental-scale observations relevant to the 
assessment of changes in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems via a wide variety of ground-based, airborne, and 
satellite platforms (Keller et al., 2008). All these long-term records reveal range shifts in ecosystems 
(Chapter 2, Section 2.3.4). 
 
The ability to estimate changes in global land biomass has improved due to the use of different microwave 
satellite data (Liu et al., 2015) and in situ forest census data and co-located lidar, combined with the 
MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS; Baccini et al., 2017). This has allowed for 
improved quantification of land temperature (Duan et al., 2019), carbon stocks and human-induced changes 
due to deforestation (Chapter 2, Section 2.2.7). Time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index 
(NDVI) from MODIS and other remote sensing platforms is widely applied to assess the effects of climate 
change on vegetation in drought-sensitive regions (Atampugre et al., 2019). New satellite imaging 
capabilities for meteorological observations, such as the advanced multi-spectral imager aboard Himawari-8 
(Bessho et al., 2016), also allow for improved monitoring of challenging quantities such as seasonal changes 
of vegetation in cloudy regions (Miura et al., 2019; Chapter 2, section 2.3.4.3).  
 
In the ocean, efforts are underway to coordinate observations of biologically-relevant EOVs around the 
globe (Muller-Karger et al., 2018; Canonico et al., 2019) and to integrate observations across disciplines 
(e.g., the Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network; Tilbrook et al., 2019). A large number of 
coordinated field campaigns during the 2015/2016 El Niño event enabled the collection of short-lived 
biological phenomena such as coral bleaching and mortality caused by a months-long ocean heatwave 
(Hughes et al., 2018); beyond this event, coordinated observations of coral reef systems are increasing in 
number and quality (Obura et al., 2019). Overall, globally coordinated efforts focused on individual 
components of the biosphere (e.g., the Global Alliance of Continuous Plankton Recorder Surveys; Batten et 
al., 2019) contribute to improved knowledge of the changing marine ecosystems (Chapter 2, Section 2.3.4.2). 
 
Given widespread evidence for decreases in global biodiversity in recent decades related to climate change 
and other forms of human disturbance (IPBES, 2019), a new international effort to identify a set of Essential 
Biodiversity Variables is underway (Pereira et al., 2013; Navarro et al., 2017).  
 
In summary, the observational coverage of ongoing changes to the climate system is improved at the time of 
AR6, relative to what was available for AR5 (high confidence). 
 
#### Paleoclimate 
 
Major paleo reconstruction efforts completed since AR5 include a variety of large-scale, multi-proxy 
temperature datasets and associated reconstructions spanning the last 2000 years (PAGES 2k Consortium, 
2017, 2019; Neukom et al., 2019), the Holocene (Kaufman et al., 2020), the Last Glacial Maximum (Cleator 
et al., 2020; Tierney et al., 2020b), the Mid-Pliocene Warm Period (McClymont et al., 2020), and the Early 
Eocene Climate Optimum (Hollis et al., 2019). Newly compiled borehole data (Cuesta-Valero et al., 2019), 
as well as advances in statistical applications to tree ring data, result in more robust reconstructions of key 
indices such as Northern Hemisphere temperature over the last millennium (e.g., Wilson et al., 2016; 
Anchukaitis et al., 2017). Such reconstructions provide a new context for recent warming trends (Chapter 2) 
and serve to constrain the response of the climate system to natural and anthropogenic forcing (Chapters 3 
and 7).  
 
Ongoing efforts have expanded the number of large-scale, tree-ring-based drought reconstructions that span 
the last centuries to millennium at annual resolution (Chapter 8; Cook et al., 2015; Stahle et al., 2016; 
Aguilera-Betti et al., 2017; Morales et al., 2020). Likewise, stalagmite records of oxygen isotopes have 
increased in number, resolution, and geographic distribution since AR5, providing insights into regional to 
global-scale hydrological change over the last centuries to millions of years (Chapter 8; Cheng et al., 2016; 
Denniston et al., 2016; Comas-Bru and Harrison, 2019). A new global compilation of water isotope-based 
paleoclimate records spanning the last 2,000 years (PAGES Iso2K) lays the groundwork for quantitative 
multi-proxy reconstructions of regional to global scale hydrological and temperature trends and extremes 
(Konecky et al., 2020). 

Recent advances in the reconstruction of climate extremes beyond temperature and drought include 
expanded datasets of past El Niño-Southern Oscillation extremes (Chapter 2, Section 2.4.2; e.g., Barrett et 
al., 2018; Freund et al., 2019; Grothe et al., 2019) and other modes of variability (Hernández et al., 2020), 
hurricane activity (e.g., Burn and Palmer, 2015; Donnelly et al., 2015), jet stream variability (Trouet et al., 
2018), and wildfires (e.g., Taylor et al., 2016). 
 
New datasets as well as recent data compilations and syntheses of sea level over the last millennia (Kopp et 
al., 2016; Kemp et al., 2018), the last 20,000 years (Khan et al., 2019), the last interglacial period (Dutton et 
al., 2015; Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3.3), and the Pliocene (Dumitru et al., 2019; Grant et al., 2019; Cross-
Chapter Box 2.4 in Chapter 2) help constrain sea level variability and its relationship to global and regional 
temperature variability, and to contributions from different sources on centennial to millennial timescales 
(Chapter 9, Section 9.6.2).   
 
Reconstructions of paleoocean pH (Chapter 2, Section 2.3.3.5) have increased in number and accuracy, 
providing new constraints on ocean pH across the last centuries (e.g., Wu et al., 2018), the last glacial cycles 
(e.g., Moy et al., 2019), and the last several million years (e.g., Anagnostou et al., 2020). Such 
reconstructions inform processes and act as benchmarks for Earth system models of the global carbon cycle 
over the recent geologic past (Chapter 5, Section 5.3.1), including previous high-CO2 warm intervals such as 
the Pliocene (Cross-Chapter Box 2.4 in Chapter 2). Particularly relevant to such investigations are 
reconstructions of atmospheric CO2 (Hönisch et al., 2012; Foster et al., 2017) that span the past millions to 
tens of millions of years.  
 
Constraints on the timing and rates of past climate changes have improved since AR5. Analytical methods 
have increased the precision and reduced sample-size requirements for key radiometric dating techniques 
including radiocarbon (Gottschalk et al., 2018; Lougheed et al., 2018) and Uranium-Thorium dating (Cheng 
et al., 2013). More accurate ages of many paleoclimate records are also facilitated by recent improvements in 
the radiocarbon calibration datasets (IntCal20, Reimer et al., 2020). A recent compilation of global 
cosmogenic nuclide-based exposure dates (Balco, 2020b) allows for a more rigorous assessment of the 
evolution of glacial landforms since the Last Glacial Maximum (Balco, 2020a). 
 
Advances in paleoclimate data assimilation (Chapter 10, Section 10.2.3.2) leverage the expanded set of 
paleoclimate observations to create physically consistent gridded fields of climate variables for data-rich 
intervals of interest (e.g., over the last millennium, Hakim et al. 2016) or last glacial period (Cleator et al., 
2020; Tierney et al., 2020b). Such efforts mirror advances in our understanding of the relationship between 
proxy records and climate variables of interest, as formalized in so-called proxy system models (e.g., 
Tolwinski-Ward et al., 2011; Dee et al., 2015; Dolman and Laepple, 2018).  
 
Overall, the number, temporal resolution, and chronological accuracy of paleoclimate reconstructions have 
increased since AR5, leading to improved understanding of climate system processes (or Earth system 
processes) (high confidence). 
 
 
### 1.5.1.2  Threats to observational capacity or continuity 
 
The lock-downs and societal outcomes arising due to the COVID-19 pandemic pose a new threat to 
observing systems. For example, WMO and UNESCO-IOC published a summary of the changes to Earth 
system observations during COVID-19 (WMO, 2020b). Fewer aircraft flights (down 75–90% in May 2020, 
depending on region) and ship transits (down 20% in May 2020) mean that onboard observations from those 
networks have reduced in number and frequency (James et al., 2020; Ingleby et al., 2021). Europe has 
deployed more radiosonde soundings to account for the reduction in data from air traffic. Fewer ocean 
observing buoys were deployed during 2020, and reductions have been particularly prevalent in the tropics 
and Southern Hemisphere. The full consequences of the pandemic and responses will come to light over 
time. Estimates of the effect of the reduction in aircraft data assimilation on weather forecasting skill are 
small (James et al., 2020; Ingleby et al., 2021), potentially alleviating concerns about veracity of future 
atmospheric reanalyses of the COVID-19 pandemic period.  
 
Surface-based networks have reduced in their coverage or range of variables measured due to COVID-19 
and other factors. Over land, several factors, including the ongoing transition from manual to automatic 
observations of weather, have reduced the spatial coverage of certain measurement types including rainfall 
intensity, radiosonde launches and pan evaporation, posing unique risks to datasets used for climate 
assessment (WMO, 2017; Lin and Huybers, 2019). Ship-based measurements, which are important for ocean 
climate and reanalyses through time (Smith et al., 2019c), have been in decline due to the number of ships 
contributing observations. There has also been a decline in the number of variables recorded by ships, but an 
increase in the quality and time-resolution of others (e.g., sea level pressure, Kent et al. 2019).  
 
Certain satellite frequencies are used to detect meteorological features that are vital to climate change 
monitoring. These can be disturbed by certain radio communications (Anterrieu et al., 2016), although 
scientists work to remove noise from the signal (Oliva et al., 2016). For example, water vapour in the 
atmosphere naturally produces a weak signal at 23.8 gigahertz, which is within the range of frequencies of 
the 5G communications network (Liu et al., 2021). Concern has been raised about potential leakage from 5G 
network transmissions into the operating frequencies of passive sensors on existing weather satellites, which 
could adversely influence their ability to remotely observe water vapour in the atmosphere (Yousefvand et 
al., 2020).   
 
Threats to observational capacity also include the loss of natural climate archives that are disappearing as a 
direct consequence of warming temperatures. Ice core records from vulnerable alpine glaciers in the tropics 
(Permana et al., 2019) and the mid-latitudes (Gabrielli et al., 2016; Winski et al., 2018; Moreno et al., 2021) 
document more frequent melt layers in recent decades, with glacial retreat occurring at a rate and geographic 
scale that is unusual in the Holocene (Solomina et al., 2015). The scope and severity of coral bleaching and 
mortality events have increased in recent decades (Hughes et al., 2018), with profound implications for the 
recovery of coral climate archives from new and existing sites. An observed increase in the mortality of 
larger, long-lived trees over the last century is attributed to a combination of warming, land use change, and 
disturbance (e.g., McDowell et al., 2020). The ongoing loss of these natural, high-resolution climate archives 
endanger an end in their coverage over recent decades, given that many of the longest monthly- to annually-
resolved paleoclimate records were collected in the 1960s to 1990s (e.g., the PAGES2K database as 
represented in PAGES 2k Consortium, 2017). This gap presents a barrier to the calibration of existing 
decades-to-centuries-long records needed to constrain past temperature and hydrology trends and extremes.  
 
Historical archives of weather and climate observations contained in ship’s logs, weather diaries, observatory 
logbooks and other sources of documentary data are also at jeopardy of loss from natural disasters or 
accidental destruction. These include measurements of temperature (air and sea surface), rainfall, surface 
pressure, wind strength and direction, sunshine amount, and many other variables back into the 19th century. 
While internationally coordinated data rescue efforts are focused on recovering documentary sources of past 
weather and climate data (e.g., Allan et al., 2011), no such coordinated efforts exist for vulnerable 
paleoclimate archives. Furthermore, oral traditions about local and regional weather and climate from 
indigenous peoples represent valuable sources of information, especially when used in combination with 
instrumental climate data (Makondo and Thomas, 2018), but are in danger of being lost as indigenous 
knowledge-holders pass away. 
 
In summary, while the quantity, quality, and diversity of climate system observations have grown since AR5, 
the loss or potential loss of several critical components of the observational network is also evident (high 
confidence). 
 
 
## 1.5.2  New developments in reanalyses 
 
Reanalyses are usually the output of a model (e.g., a numerical weather prediction model) constrained by 
observations using data assimilation techniques, but the term has also been used to describe observation-
based datasets produced using simpler statistical methods and models (see Annex I). This section focuses on 
the model-based methods and their recent developments.  
 
Reanalyses complement datasets of observations in describing changes through the historical record and are 
sometimes considered as ‘maps without gaps’ because they provide gridded output in space and time, often 
global, with physical consistency across variables on sub-daily timescales, and information about sparsely-
observed variables (such as evaporation) (Hersbach et al., 2020). They can be globally complete, or 
regionally focussed and constrained by boundary conditions from a global reanalysis (Chapter 10, Section 
10.2.1.2). They can also provide feedback about the quality of the observations assimilated, including 
estimates of biases and critical gaps for some observing systems. 
 
Many early reanalyses are described in Box 2.3 of Hartmann et al. (2013). These were often limited by the 
underlying model, the data assimilation schemes and observational issues (Thorne and Vose, 2010; Zhou et 
al., 2018). Observational issues include the lack of underlying observations in some regions, changes in the 
observational systems over time (e.g., spatial coverage, introduction of satellite data), and time-dependent 
errors in the underlying observations or in the boundary conditions, which may lead to stepwise biases in 
time. The assimilation of sparse or inconsistent observations can introduce mass or energy imbalances 
(Valdivieso et al., 2017; Trenberth et al., 2019). Further limitations and some efforts to reduce the 
implications of these observational issues will be detailed below.  
 
The methods used in the development of reanalyses have progressed since AR5 and, in some cases, this has 
important implications for the information they provide on how the climate is changing. Annex I includes a 
list of reanalysis datasets used in the AR6. Recent major developments in reanalyses include the assimilation 
of a wider range of observations, higher spatial and temporal resolution, extensions further back in time, and 
greater efforts to minimise the influence of a temporally varying observational network.  
 
### Atmospheric reanalyses 
Extensive improvements have been made in global atmospheric reanalyses since AR5. The growing demand 
for high-resolution data has led to the development of higher-resolution atmospheric reanalyses, such as the 
Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA2; Gelaro et al., 
2017) and ERA5 (Hersbach et al., 2020). There is a focus on ERA5 here because it has been assessed as of 
high enough quality to present temperature trends alongside more traditional observational datasets (Chapter 
2, Section 2.3.1.1) and is also used in the Interactive Atlas. 
 
Atmospheric reanalyses that were assessed in AR5 are still being used in the literature, and results from 
ERA-Interim (Dee et al., 2011, ~80 km resolution, production stopped in August 2019), the Japanese 55-year 
Reanalysis (JRA-55) (Ebita et al., 2011; Kobayashi et al., 2015; Harada et al., 2016) and Climate Forecast 
System Reanalysis (CFSR) (Saha et al., 2010) are assessed in AR6. Some studies still also use the 
NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, particularly because it extends back to 1948 and is updated in near real-time 
(Kistler et al., 2001). Older reanalyses have a number of limitations, which have to be accounted for when 
assessing the results of any study that uses them.  
 
ERA5 provides hourly atmospheric fields at about 31 km resolution on 137 levels in the vertical, as well as 
land surface variables and ocean waves, and is available from 1979 onwards and is updated in near real-time, 
with plans to extend back to 1950. A 10-member ensemble is also available at coarser resolution, allowing 
uncertainty estimates to be provided (e.g., Chapter 2, Section 2.3). MERRA-2 includes many updates from 
the earlier version, including the assimilation of aerosol observations, several improvements to the 
representation of the stratosphere, including ozone, and improved representations of cryospheric processes. 
All of these improvements increase the usefulness of these reanalyses (Hoffmann et al., 2019; Chapter 7, 
Section 7.3).  
 
Models of atmospheric composition and emission sources and sinks allow the forecast and reanalysis of 
constituents such as O3, CO, NOx and aerosols. The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) 
reanalysis shows improvement against earlier atmospheric composition reanalyses, giving greater confidence 
for its use to study trends and evaluate models (e.g., Inness et al., 2019; Chapter 7, Section 7.3). 

The inter-comparison of reanalyses with each other, or with earlier versions, is often done for particular 
variables or aspects of the simulation. ERA5 is assessed as the most reliable reanalysis for climate trend 
assessment (Chapter 2, Section 2.3). Compared to ERA-Interim, the ERA5 forecast model and assimilation 
system, as well as the availability of improved reprocessing of observations, resulted in relatively smaller 
errors when compared to observations, including a better representation of global energy budgets, radiative 
forcing from volcanic eruptions (e.g., Mt. Pinatubo: Allan et al., 2020), the partitioning of surface energy 
(Martens et al., 2020) and wind (Kaiser-Weiss et al., 2015, 2019; Borsche et al., 2016; Scherrer, 2020). In 
ERA5, higher resolution means a better representation of Lagrangian motion convective updrafts, gravity 
waves, tropical cyclones, and other meso- to synoptic-scale features of the atmosphere (Hoffmann et al., 
2019; Martens et al., 2020). Low-frequency variability is found to be generally well represented and, from 10 
hPa downwards, patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and 
JRA-55 reanalyses. Inhomogeneities in the water cycle have also been reduced (Hersbach et al., 2020).  
 
Precipitation is not usually assimilated in reanalyses and, depending on the region, reanalysis precipitation 
can differ from observations by more than the observational error (Zhou and Wang, 2017; Sun et al., 2018; 
Alexander et al., 2020; Bador et al., 2020), although these studies did not include ERA5. Assimilation of 
radiance observations from microwave imagers which, over ice-free ocean surfaces, improve the analysis of 
lower-tropospheric humidity, cloud liquid water and ocean surface wind speed have resulted in improved 
precipitation outputs in ERA5 (Hersbach et al., 2020). Global averages of other fields, particularly 
temperature, from ERA-Interim and JRA-55 reanalyses continue to be consistent over the last 20 years with 
surface observational data sets that include the polar regions (Simmons and Poli, 2015), although biases in 
precipitation and radiation can influence temperatures regionally (Zhou et al., 2018). The global average 
surface temperature from MERRA-2 is far cooler in recent years than temperatures derived from ERA-
Interim and JRA-55, which may be due to the assimilation of aerosols and their interactions (see Chapter 2, 
Section 2.3).  
 
A number of regional atmospheric reanalyses (see Chapter 10, Section 10.2.1.2) have been developed, such 
as COSMO-REA (Wahl et al., 2017), and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology Atmospheric high-
resolution Regional Reanalysis for Australia (BARRA) (Su et al., 2019). Regional reanalyses can add value 
to global reanalyses due to the lower computational requirements, and can allow multiple numerical weather 
prediction models to be tested (e.g., Kaiser-Weiss et al., 2019). There is some evidence that these higher 
resolution reanalyses better capture precipitation variability than global lower resolution reanalyses (Jermey 
and Renshaw, 2016; Cui et al., 2017) and are further assessed in Chapter 10, Section 10.2.1.2 and used in the 
Interactive Atlas. 
 
In summary, the improvements in atmospheric reanalyses, and the greater number of years since the routine 
ingestion of satellite data began relative to AR5, mean that there is increased confidence in using 
atmospheric reanalyses products alongside more standard observation-based datasets in AR6 (high 
confidence). 
 
### Sparse input reanalyses of the instrumental era 
 
Although reanalyses such as ERA5 take advantage of new observational datasets and present a great 
improvement in atmospheric reanalyses, the issues introduced by the evolving observational network remain. 
Sparse input reanalyses, where only a limited set of reliable and long observed records are assimilated, 
address these issues, with the limitation of fewer observational constraints. These efforts are sometimes 
called centennial-scale reanalyses. One example is the atmospheric 20th Century Reanalysis (Compo et al., 
2011; Slivinski et al., 2021) which assimilates only surface and sea-level pressure observations, and is 
constrained by time-varying observed changes in atmospheric constituents, prescribed sea surface 
temperatures and sea ice concentration, creating a reconstruction of the weather over the whole globe every 3 
hours for the period 1806–2015. The ERA-20C atmospheric reanalysis (covering 1900–2010; Poli et al., 
2016) also assimilates marine wind observations, and CERA-20C is a centennial-scale reanalysis that 
assimilates both atmospheric and oceanic observations for the 1901–2010 period (Laloyaux et al., 2018). 
These centennial-scale reanalyses are often run as ensembles that provide an estimate of the uncertainty in 
the simulated variables over space and time. Slivinski et al. (2021) conclude that the uncertainties in surface 
circulation fields in version 3 of the 20th Century Reanalysis are reliable and that there is also skill in its 
tropospheric reconstruction over the 20th century. Long-term changes in other variables, such as 
precipitation, also agree well with direct observation-based datasets (Chapter 2, Section 2.3.1.3; Chapter 8, 
Section 8.3.2.8).  
 
### Ocean reanalyses 
 
Since AR5, ocean reanalyses have improved due to: increased model resolution (Zuo et al., 2017; Lellouche 
et al., 2018; Heimbach et al., 2019); improved physics (Storto et al., 2019); improvements in the atmospheric 
forcing from atmospheric reanalyses (see preceding subsection); and improvements in the data quantity and 
quality available for assimilation (e.g., Lellouche et al., 2018; Heimbach et al., 2019), particularly due to 
Argo observations (Zuo et al., 2019) (see Annex I).  
 
The first Ocean Reanalyses Intercomparison project (Balmaseda et al., 2015) focussed on the uncertainty in 
key climate indicators, such as ocean heat content (Palmer et al., 2017), thermosteric sea level (Storto et al., 
2017, 2019), salinity (Shi et al., 2017), sea ice extent (Chevallier et al., 2017), and the AMOC (Karspeck et 
al., 2017). Reanalysis uncertainties occur in areas of inhomogeneous or sparse observational data sampling, 
such as for the deep ocean, the Southern Ocean and western boundary currents (Lellouche et al., 2018; Storto 
et al., 2019). Intercomparisons have also been dedicated to specific variables such as mixed-layer depths 
(Toyoda et al., 2017), eddy kinetic energy (Masina et al., 2017) of the polar regions (Uotila et al., 2019). 
Karspeck et al. (2017) found disagreement in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC)` 
variability and strength in reanalyses over observation-sparse periods, whereas Jackson et al. (2019) reported 
a lower spread in AMOC strength across an ensemble of ocean reanalyses of the recent period (1993-2010) 
linked to improved observation availability for assimilation. Reanalyses also have a larger spread of ocean 
heat uptake than data-only products and can produce spurious overestimates of heat uptake (Palmer et al., 
2017), which is important in the context of estimating climate sensitivity (Storto et al., 2019). The ensemble 
approach for ocean reanalyses provides another avenue for estimating uncertainties across ocean reanalyses 
(Storto et al., 2019).  
 
While there are still limitations in their representation of oceanic features, ocean reanalyses add value to 
observation-only based products and are used to inform assessments in AR6 (Chapters 2, 3, 7 and 9). 
Reanalyses of the atmosphere or ocean alone may not account for important atmosphere-ocean coupling, 
motivating the development of coupled reanalyses (Laloyaux et al., 2018; Schepers et al., 2018; Penny et al., 
2019), but these are not assessed in AR6.  
 
### Reanalyses of the pre-instrumental era 
 
Longer reanalyses that extend further back in time than the beginning of the instrumental record are being 
developed. They include the complete integration of paleoclimate archives and newly available early 
instrumental data into extended reanalysis datasets. Such integration leverages ongoing development of 
climate models that can simulate paleoclimate records in their units of analysis (i.e., oxygen isotope 
composition, tree ring width, etc.), in many cases using physical climate variables as input for so-called 
‘proxy system models’ (Evans et al., 2013; Dee et al., 2015). Ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation 
approaches allow to combine paleoclimate data and climate model data to generate annually resolved fields 
(Last Millenium Reanalysis, Hakim et al., 2016; Tardif et al., 2018) or even monthly fields (Franke et al., 
2017). This allows for a greater understanding of decadal variability (Parsons and Hakim, 2019) and greater 
certainty around the full range of the frequency and severity of climate extremes, allowing for better-defined 
detection of change. It also helps to identify the links between biogeochemical cycles, ecosystem structure 
and ecosystem functioning, and to provide initial conditions for further model experiments or downscaling 
(see Chapter 2). 
 
### Applications of reanalyses 
 
The developments in reanalyses described above mean that they are now used across a range of applications. 
In AR6, reanalyses provide information for fields and in regions where observations are limited. There is 
growing confidence that modern reanalyses can provide another line of evidence in describing recent 
temperature trends (see Chapter 2, Tables 2.4 and 2.5) As their spatial resolution increases, the exploration of 
fine-scale extremes in both space and time becomes possible (e.g., wind; Kaiser-Weiss et al., 2015). Longer 
reanalyses can be used to describe the change in the climate over the last 100 to 1000 years. Reanalyses have 
been used to help post-process climate model output, and drive impact models, however, they are often bias 
adjusted first (e.g., Weedon et al., 2014). See Cross-Chapter Box 10.2 in Chapter 10. Copernicus Climate 
Change Service (C3S) provides a bias adjusted dataset for global land areas based on ERA5 called WFDE5 
(Cucchi et al., 2020) which, combined with ERA5 information over the ocean (W5E5; Lange, 2019), is used 
as the AR6 Interactive Atlas reference for the bias adjustment of model output.  
 
The growing interest in longer-term climate forecasts (from seasonal to multi-year and decadal) means that 
reanalyses are now more routinely being used to develop the initial state for these forecasts, such as for the 
Decadal Climate Prediction Project (DCPP; Boer et al., 2016). Ocean reanalyses are now being used 
routinely in the context of climate monitoring, (e.g., the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service 
Ocean State Report; von Schuckmann et al., 2019).  
 
In summary, reanalyses have improved since AR5 and can increasingly be used as a line of evidence in 
assessments of the state and evolution of the climate system (high confidence). Reanalyses provide 
consistency across multiple physical quantities, and information about variables and locations that are not 
directly observed. Since AR5, new reanalyses have been developed with various combinations of increased 
resolution, extended records, more consistent data assimilation, estimation of uncertainty arising from the 
range of initial conditions, and an improved representation of the atmosphere or ocean system. While noting 
their remaining limitations, the WGI Report uses the most recent generation of reanalysis products alongside 
more standard observation-based datasets.  
 
 
## 1.5.3  Climate Models  
 
A wide range of numerical models are widely used in climate science to study the climate system and its 
behaviour across multiple temporal and spatial scales. These models are the main tools available to look 
ahead into possible climate futures under a range of scenarios (see Section 1.6). Global Earth System Models 
(ESMs) are the most complex models which contribute to AR6. At the core of each ESM is a GCM (General 
Circulation Model) representing the dynamics of the atmosphere and ocean. ESMs are complemented by 
regional models (see Chapter 10, Section 10.3.1) and by a hierarchy of models of lower complexity. This 
section summarizes major developments in these different types of models since AR5. Past IPCC reports 
have made use of multi-model ensembles generated through various phases of the World Climate Research 
Programme (WCRP) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). Analysis of the latest CMIP Phase 6 
(CMIP6, Eyring et al., 2016) simulations constitute a key line of evidence supporting this assessment report 
(see Section 1.5.4). The key characteristics of models participating in CMIP6 are listed in Annex II. 
 
 
### 1.5.3.1  Earth System Models  
 
Earth system models are mathematical formulations of the natural laws that govern the evolution of climate-
relevant systems: atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, land, and biosphere, and the carbon cycle (Flato, 2011). 
They build on the fundamental laws of physics (e.g., Navier-Stokes or Clausius-Clapeyron equations) or 
empirical relationships established from observations and, when possible, constrained by fundamental 
conservation laws (e.g., mass and energy). The evolution of climate-relevant variables is computed 
numerically using high performance computers (André et al., 2014; Balaji et al., 2017), on three-dimensional 
discrete grids (Staniforth and Thuburn, 2012). The spatial (and temporal) resolution of these grids in both the 
horizontal and vertical directions determines which processes need to be parameterised or whether they can 
be explicitly resolved. Developments since AR5 in model resolution, parameterizations and modelling of the 
land and ocean biosphere and of biogeochemical cycles are discussed below. 
 
#### Model grids and resolution 

The horizontal resolution and the number of vertical levels in ESMs is generally higher in CMIP6 than in 
CMIP5 (Figure 1.19). Global models with finer horizontal grids represent better many aspects of the 
circulation of the atmosphere (Gao et al., 2020; Schiemann et al., 2020) and ocean (Bishop et al., 2016; 
Storkey et al., 2018), bringing improvements in the simulation of the global hydrological cycle (Roberts et 
al., 2018). CMIP6 includes a dedicated effort (HighResMIP, Haarsma et al., 2016) to explore the effect of 
higher horizontal resolution, such as ~50 km, ~25 km and even ~10 km (see 1.5.4.2 and Annex II, Table 
AII.6). Improvements are documented in the highest resolution coupled models used for HighResMip 
(Hewitt et al., 2017b; Roberts et al., 2019). Flexible grids allowing spatially variable resolution are more 
widely used than at the time of the AR5 in the atmosphere (McGregor, 2015; Giorgetta et al., 2018) and in 
the ocean (Wang et al., 2014; Petersen et al., 2019). 
 
The number of vertical levels in the atmosphere of global models has increased (Figure 1.19) partly to enable 
simulations to include higher levels in the atmosphere and better represent stratospheric processes (Charlton-
Perez et al., 2013; Kawatani et al., 2019). Half the modelling groups now use ‘high top’ models with a top 
level above the stratopause (a pressure of about 1 hPa). The number of vertical levels in the ocean models 
has also increased in order to achieve finer resolution over the water column and especially in the upper 
mixed layer, and better resolve the diurnal cycle (Bernie et al., 2008) (see Chapter 3, Section 3.5 and Annex 
II). 
 
Despite the documented progress of higher resolution, the model evaluation carried out in subsequent 
chapters shows that improvements between CMIP5 and CMIP6 remain modest at the global scale (Bock et 
al., 2020; Chapter 3, Section 3.8.2). Lower resolution alone does not explain all model biases, for example, a 
low blocking frequency (Davini and D’Andrea, 2020) or a wrong shape of the Intertropical Convergence 
Zone (Tian and Dong, 2020). Model performance depends on model formulation and parameterizations as 
much as on resolution (Chapter 3, Chapter 8, Chapter 10).  
 
<figref>1.19</figref> 
 
#### Representation of physical and chemical processes in ESMs 
Atmospheric models include representations of physical processes such as clouds, turbulence, convection 
and gravity waves that are not fully represented by grid-scale dynamics. The CMIP6 models have undergone 
updates in some of their parameterization schemes compared to their CMIP5 counterparts, with the aim of 
better representing the physics and bringing the climatology of the models closer to newly available 
observational datasets. Most notable developments are to schemes involving radiative transfer, cloud 
microphysics, and aerosols, in particular a more explicit representation of the aerosol indirect effects through 
aerosol-induced modification of cloud properties. Broadly, aerosol-cloud microphysics has been a key topic 
for the aerosol and chemistry modelling communities since AR5, leading to improved understanding of the 
climate influence of short-lived climate forcers, but they remain the single largest source of spread in ESM 
calculations of climate sensitivity (Meehl et al., 2020), with numerous parameterization schemes in use 
(Gettelman and Sherwood, 2016; Zhao et al., 2018; Gettelman et al., 2019). See also Chapter 6, section 6.4. 
The treatment of droplet size and mixed-phase clouds (liquid and ice) was found to lead to changes in 
climate sensitivity (Annex VII: Glossary) of some models between AR5 and AR6 (Bodas-Salcedo et al., 
2019; Gettelman et al., 2019; Zelinka et al., 2020, Chapter 7, Section 7.4).  
 
The representation of ocean and cryosphere processes has also evolved significantly since CMIP5. The 
explicit representation of ocean eddies, due to increased grid resolution (typically, from 1° to ¼°), is a major 
advance in a number of CMIP6 ocean model components (Hewitt et al., 2017b). Advances in sea ice models 
have been made, for example, through correcting known shortcomings in CMIP5 simulations, in particular 
the persistent underestimation of the rapid decline in summer Arctic sea ice extent (Rosenblum and 
Eisenman, 2016, 2017; Turner and Comiso, 2017; Notz and Stroeve, 2018). The development of glacier and 
ice-sheet models has been motivated and guided by an improved understanding of key physical processes, 
including grounding line dynamics, stratigraphy and microstructure evolution, sub-shelf melting, and glacier 
and ice-shelf calving, among others (Faria et al., 2014, 2018; Hanna et al., 2020). The resolution of ice sheet 
models has continuously increased, including the use of nested grids, sub-grid interpolation schemes, and 
adaptive mesh approaches (Cornford et al., 2016), mainly for a more accurate representation of grounding-
line migration and data assimilation (Pattyn, 2018). Ice-sheet models are increasingly interactively coupled 
with global and regional climate models, accounting for the height mass-balance feedback (Vizcaino et al., 
2015; Le clec’h et al., 2019), and enabling a better representation of ice-ocean processes, in particular for the 
Antarctic Ice Sheet (Asay-Davis et al., 2017).   
 
Sea level rise is caused by multiple processes acting on multiple time scales: ocean warming, glaciers and ice 
sheet melting, change in water storage on land, glacial isostatic adjustment (Chapter 9, Box 9.1) but no 
single model can represent all these processes (Chapter 9, Section 9.6). In this report, the contributions are 
computed separately (Chapter 9, Figure 9.28) and merged into a common probabilistic framework and 
updated from AR5 (Church et al., 2013; Kopp et al., 2014; Chapter 9, Section 9.6). 
 
Another notable development since AR5 is the inclusion of stochastic parameterizations of sub-grid 
processes in some comprehensive climate models (Sanchez et al., 2016). Here, the deterministic differential 
equations that govern the dynamical evolution of the model are complemented by knowledge of the 
stochastic variability in unresolved processes. While not yet widely implemented, the approach has been 
shown to improve the forecasting skill of weather models, to reduce systematic biases in global models 
(Berner et al., 2017; Palmer, 2019) and to influence simulated climate sensitivity (Strommen et al., 2019). 
 
#### Representation of biogeochemistry, including the carbon cycle 

Since AR5, more sophisticated land use and land cover change representations in ESMs have been 
developed to simulate the effects of land management on surface fluxes of carbon, water and energy 
(Lawrence et al., 2016), although the integration of many processes (e.g., wetland drainage, fire as a 
management tool) remains a challenge (Pongratz et al., 2018). The importance of nitrogen availability to 
limit the terrestrial carbon sequestration has been recognised (Zaehle et al., 2014; Chapter 5, Section 5.4) and 
so an increasing number of models now include a prognostic representation of the terrestrial nitrogen cycle 
and its coupling to the land carbon cycle (Jones et al., 2016a; Arora et al., 2020), leading to a reduction in 
uncertainty for carbon budgets (Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020; Chapter 5, Section 5.1). As was the case in 
CMIP5 (Ciais et al., 2013), the land surface processes represented vary across CMIP6 models, with at least 
some key processes (fire, permafrost carbon, microbes, nutrients, vegetation dynamics, plant demography) 
absent from any particular ESM land model (Chapter 5, Table 5.4). Ocean biogeochemical models have 
evolved to enhance the consistency of the exchanges between ocean, atmosphere and land, through riverine 
input and dust deposition (Stock et al., 2014; Aumont et al., 2015). Other developments include flexible 
plankton stoichiometric ratios (Galbraith and Martiny, 2015), improvements in the representation of nitrogen 
fixation (Paulsen et al., 2017), and the limitation of plankton growth by iron (Aumont et al., 2015). Due to 
the long time scale of biogeochemical processes, spin-up strategies have been shown to affect the 
performance of models used in AR5 (Séférian et al., 2016).  
 
 
### 1.5.3.2  Model tuning and adjustment 
 
When developing climate models, choices have to be made in a number of areas. Besides model formulation 
and resolution, parameterizations of unresolved processes also involve many choices as, for each of these, 
several parameters can be set. The acceptable range for these parameters is set by mathematical consistency 
(e.g., convergence of a numerical scheme), physical considerations (e.g., energy conservation), observations, 
or a combination of factors. Model developers choose a set of parameters that both falls within this range and 
mimics observations of individual processes or their statistics. 
 
An initial set of such choices is usually made by (often extensive) groups of modellers working on individual 
components of the Earth system (e.g., ocean, atmosphere, land or sea ice). As components are assembled to 
build an ESM, the choices are refined so that the simulated climate best represents a number of pre-defined 
climate variables, or ‘tuning targets’. When these are met the model is released for use in intercomparisons 
such as CMIP. Tuning targets can be one of three types: mean climate, regional phenomena and features, and 
historical trends (Hourdin et al., 2017). One example of such a goal is that the climate system should reach a 
mean equilibrium temperature close to observations when energy received from the sun is close to its 
observed value. Whether tuning should be performed to accurate simulating long-term trends such as 
changes in global mean temperature over the historical era, or rather be performed for each process 
independently such that all collective behaviour is emergent, is an open question (Schmidt et al., 2017; 
Burrows et al., 2018). 
 
Each modelling group has its own strategy and, after AR5, a survey was conducted to understand the tuning 
approach used in 23 CMIP5 modelling centres. The results are discussed in Hourdin et al. (2017), which 
stresses that the behaviour of ESMs depends on the tuning strategy. An important recommendation is that the 
calibration steps that lead to particular model tuning should be carefully documented. In CMIP6 each 
modelling group now describes the three levels of tuning, both for the complete ESM and for the individual 
components (available at https://explore.es-doc.org/ and in the published model descriptions, Annex II). The 
most important global tuning target for CMIP6 models is the net top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) heat flux and 
its radiative components. Other global targets include: the decomposition of each of these TOA fluxes into a 
clear sky component and a component due to the radiative effect of clouds, global mean air and ocean 
temperature, sea ice extent, sea ice volume, glacial mass balance, global root mean square error of 
precipitation. The TOA heat flux balance is achieved using a diversity of approaches, usually unique to each 
modelling group. Adjustments are made for parameters associated with uncertain or poorly constrained 
processes (Schmidt et al., 2017), for example the aerosol indirect effects, adjustments to ocean albedo, 
marine dimethyl sulfide (DMS) parameterization, or cloud properties (Mauritsen and Roeckner, 2020).  
 
Regional tuning targets include the meridional overturning circulation in the Atlantic Ocean, the Southern 
Ocean circulation and temperature profiles in ocean basins (Golaz et al., 2019; Sellar et al., 2019); regional 
land properties and precipitations (Mauritsen et al., 2019; Yukimoto et al., 2019), latitudinal distribution of 
radiation (Boucher et al., 2020), spatial contrasts in TOA radiative fluxes or surface fluxes, and stationary 
waves in the Northern Hemisphere (Schmidt et al., 2017; Yukimoto et al., 2019). 
 
Even with some core commonalities of approaches to model tuning, practices can differ, such as the use of 
initial drift from initialized forecasts, the explicit use of the transient observed record for the historical 
period, or the use of the present-day radiative imbalance at the TOA as a tuning target rather than an 
equilibrated pre-industrial balance. The majority of CMIP6 modelling groups report that they do not tune 
their model for the observed trends during the historical period (23 out of 29), nor for equilibrium climate 
sensitivity (25 out of 29). ECS and TCR are thus emergent properties for a large majority of models. The 
effect of tuning on model skill and ensemble spread in CMIP6 is further discussed in Chapter 3, Section 3.3.  
 
 
### 1.5.3.3  From global to regional models 
 
The need for accurate climate information at the regional scale is increasing (Chapter 10, Section 10.1). 
High-resolution global climate models, such as those taking part in HighResMIP, provide more detailed 
information at the regional scale (Roberts et al., 2018). However, due to the large computational resources 
required by these models, only a limited number of simulations per model are available. In addition to CMIP 
global models, regional information can be derived using Regional Climate Models (RCMs) and 
downscaling techniques, presented in Chapter 10 and the Atlas. RCMs are dynamical models similar to 
GCMs that simulate a limited region and are forced with boudary conditions from a global simulation, often 
correcting for biases (Chapter 10, Section 10.3 and Cross-Chapter Box 10.2, Annex II). This approach allows 
the use of a higher resolution within the chosen domain, and thus better represent important drivers of 
regional climate such as mountain ranges, land management and urban effects. RCMs resolving atmospheric 
convection explicitly are now included in intercomparisons (Coppola et al., 2020) and used in Chapters 10, 
11 and 12. Other approaches are also used to generate regional climate projections, such as statistical 
downscaling (Maraun and Widmann, 2018; Chapter 10, Section 10.3). 
 
The number of climate centres or consortia that carry out global climate simulations and projections has 
grown from 11 in the first CMIP to 19 in CMIP5 and 28 for CMIP6 (see Section 1.5.4.2 and Annex II). 
Regional climate models participating in the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) are 
more diverse than the global ESMs (see Section 1.5.4.3 and Annex II) and engage an even wider 
international community (Figure 1.20). 
 
<figref>1.20</figref> 
 
### 1.5.3.4  Models of lower complexity 
 
Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs) complement the model hierarchy and fill the 
gap between conceptual, simple climate models and complex GCMs or ESMs (Claussen et al., 2002). 
EMICs are simplified; they include processes in a more parameterized, rather than explicitly calculated, form 
and generally have lower spatial resolution compared to the complex ESMs. As a result, EMICs require 
much less computational resource and can be integrated for many thousands of years without 
supercomputers (Hajima et al., 2014). The range of EMICs used in climate change research is highly 
heterogeneous, ranging from zonally averaged or mixed-layer ocean models coupled to statistical-dynamical 
models of the atmosphere to low-resolution 3-dimensional ocean models coupled to simplified dynamical 
models of the atmosphere. An increasing number of EMICs include interactive representations of the global 
carbon cycle, with varying levels of complexity and numbers of processes considered (Plattner et al., 2008; 
Zickfeld et al., 2013; MacDougall et al., 2020). Given the heterogeneity of the EMIC community, modelers 
tend to focus on specific research questions and develop individual models accordingly. As for any type of 
models assessed in this report, the set of EMICs undergoes thorough evaluation and fit-for-purpose testing 
before being applied to address specific climate aspects. 
 
EMICs have been used extensively in past IPCC reports, providing long-term integrations on paleoclimate 
and future timescales, including stabilization pathways and a range of commitment scenarios, with perturbed 
physics ensembles and sensitivity studies, or with simulations targeting the uncertainty in global climate-
carbon cycle systems (e.g., Meehl et al., 2007; Collins et al., 2013). More recently, a number of studies have 
pointed to the possibility of systematically different climate responses to external forcings in EMICs and 
complex ESMs (Frölicher and Paynter, 2015; Pfister and Stocker, 2017, 2018) that need to be considered in 
the context of this report. For example, Frölicher and Paynter (2015) showed that EMICs have a higher 
simulated realized warming fraction (i.e., the TCR/ECS ratio) than CMIP5 ESMs and speculated that this 
may bias the temperature response to zero carbon emissions. But, in a recent comprehensive multi-model 
analysis of the zero CO2 emissions commitment, MacDougall et al. (2020) did not find any significant 
differences in committed temperatures 90 years after halting emissions between EMICs and ESMs. While 
some EMICs contribute to parts of the CMIP6-endorsed MIPs, a coordinated EMICs modeling effort similar 
to the ones for the AR4 (Plattner et al., 2008) and AR5 (Eby et al., 2013; Zickfeld et al., 2013) is not in place 
for IPCC AR6; however, EMICs are assessed in a number of chapters. For example, Chapters 4 and 5 use 
EMICs in the assessment of long-term climate change beyond 2100 (Chapter 5, Section 5.5), zero-emission 
commitments, overshoot and recovery (Chapter 4, Section 4.7), consequences of carbon dioxide removal 
(CDR) on the climate system and the carbon cycle (Chapter 4, Sections 4.6 and Chapter 5, Section 5.6) and 
long-term carbon cycle–climate feedbacks (Chapter 5, Section 5.4). 
 
Physical emulators and simple climate models make up a broad class of heavily parametrized models 
designed to reproduce the responses of the more complex, process-based models, and provide rapid 
translations of emissions, via concentrations and radiative forcing, into probabilistic estimates of changes to 
the physical climate system. The main application of emulators is to extrapolate insights from ESMs and 
observational constraints to a larger set of emission scenarios (see Cross-Chapter Box 7.1 in Chapter 7). The 
computational efficiency of various emulating approaches opens new analytical possibilities given that 
ESMs take a lot of computational resources for each simulation. The applicability and usefulness of 
emulating approaches are however constrained by their skill in capturing the global mean climate responses 
simulated by the ESMs (mainly limited to global-mean or hemispheric land/ocean temperatures) and by their 
ability to extrapolate skilfully outside the calibrated range. 
 
The terms emulator and simple climate model (SCM) are different, although they are sometimes used 
interchangeably. SCM refers to a broad class of lower-dimensional models of the energy balance, radiative 
transfer, carbon cycle, or a combination of such physical components. SCMs can also be tuned to reproduce 
the calculations of climate-mean variables of a given ESM, assuming that their structural flexibility can 
capture both the parametric and structural uncertainties across process-oriented ESM responses. When run in 
this setup, they are termed emulators. Simple climate models do not have to be run in ‘emulation’ mode, 
though, as they can also be used to test consistency across multiple lines of evidence with regard to ranges in 
ECS, TCR, TCRE and carbon cycle feedbacks (see Chapters 5 and 7). Physical emulation can also be 
performed with very simple parameterisations (‘one-or-few-line climate models’), statistical methods like 
neural networks, genetic algorithms, or other artificial intelligence approaches, where the emulator behaviour 
is explicitly tuned to reproduce the response of a given ESM or model ensemble (Chapters 4, 5, and 7). 
 
Current emulators and SCMs include the generic impulse response model outlined in Chapter 8 of the AR5 
(AR5-IR (Supplementary Material 8.SM.11 of Myhre et al. (2013)), two-layer models (Held et al., 2010; 
Rohrschneider et al., 2019; Nicholls et al., 2020), and higher complexity approaches that include upwelling, 
diffusion and entrainment in the ocean component (e.g., MAGICC Version 5.3 (Raper et al., 2001; Wigley et 
al., 2009), Version 6/7 (Meinshausen et al., 2011a); OSCAR (Gasser et al., 2017); CICERO SCM (Skeie et 
al., 2017); FaIR (Millar et al., 2017b; Smith et al., 2018); and a range of statistical approaches (Schwarber et 
al., 2019; Beusch et al., 2020b)). An example of recent use of an emulator approach is an early estimate of 
the climate implications of the COVID-19 lockdowns (Forster et al. 2020; see Cross-Chapter Box 6.1 in 
Chapter 6).  
 
Since AR5, simplified climate models have been developed further, and their use is increasing. Different 
purposes motivating development include: being as simple as possible for teaching purposes (e.g., a two-
layer energy balance model), as comprehensive as possible to allow for propagation of uncertainties across 
multiple Earth System domains (MAGICC and others), or focus on higher complexity representation of 
specific domains (e.g., OSCAR). The common theme in many models is to improve parameterisations that 
reflect the latest findings in complex ESM interactions, such as the nitrogen cycle addition to the carbon 
cycle, or tropospheric and stratospheric ozone exchange, with the aim of emulating their global mean 
temperature response. Also, within the simple models that have a rudimentary representation of spatial 
heterogeneity (e.g., four-box simple climate models), the ambition is to represent heterogeneous forcers such 
as black carbon more adequately (Stjern et al., 2017), provide an appropriate representation of the forcing-
feedback framework (see e.g., Sherwood et al., 2015), investigate new parameterisations of ocean heat 
uptake, and implement better representations of volcanic aerosol induced cooling (Gregory et al., 2016a). 

MAGICC (Wigley et al., 2009; Meinshausen et al., 2011a) and FaIR (Smith et al., 2018) were used in the 
SR1.5 (IPCC, 2018) to categorize mitigation pathways into classes of scenarios that peak near 1.5°C, 
overshoot 1.5°C, or stay below 2°C. The SR1.5 (Rogelj et al., 2018) concluded that there was a high 
agreement in the relative temperature response of pathways, but medium agreement on the precise absolute 
magnitude of warming, introducing a level of imprecision in the attribution of a single pathway to a given 
category. 
 
In this Report, there are two notable uses of simple climate models. One is the connection between the 
assessed range of ECS in Chapter 7, and the projections of future global surface air temperature (GSAT) 
change in Chapter 4, which is done via a two-layer model based on Held et al. (2010). It is also used as input 
to sea level projections in Chapter 9. The other usage is the transfer of Earth system assessment knowledge 
to Working Group III, via a set of models (MAGICC, FaIR, CICERO-SCM) specifically tuned to represent 
the Working Group I assessment. For an overview of the uses, and an assessment of the related Reduced 
Complexity Model Intercomparison Project (RCMIP), see Nicholls et al. (2020) and Cross-Chapter Box 7.1 
in Chapter 7.

## 1.5.4  Modelling techniques, comparisons and performance assessments  
 
Numerical models, however complex, cannot be a perfect representation of the real world. Results from 
climate modelling simulations constitute a key line of evidence for the present report, which requires 
considering the limitations of each model simulation. This section presents recent developments in 
techniques and approaches to robustly extract, quantify and compare results from multiple, independent 
climate models, and how their performance can be assessed and validated.  
 
 
### 1.5.4.1  Model ‘fitness for purpose’ 
 
A key issue addressed in this report is whether climate models are adequate or ‘fit’ for purposes of interest, 
that is, whether they can be used to successfully answer particular research questions, especially about the 
causes of recent climate change and the future evolution of climate (e.g., Parker, 2009; Notz, 2015; Knutti, 
2018; Winsberg, 2018). Assessment of a model’s fitness-for-purpose can be informed both by how the 
model represents relevant physical processes and by relevant performance metrics (Baumberger et al., 2017; 
Parker, 2020). The processes and metrics that are most relevant can vary with the question of interest, for 
example, a question about changes in deep ocean circulation versus a question about changes in regional 
precipitation (Notz, 2015; Gramelsberger et al., 2020). New model evaluation tools (Section 1.5.4.5) and 
emergent constraint methodologies (Section 1.5.4.7) can also aid the assessment of fitness-for-purpose, 
especially in conjunction with process understanding (Klein and Hall, 2015; Knutti, 2018). The broader 
availability of large model ensemble may allow for novel tests of fitness that better account for natural 
climate variability (see Section 1.5.4.2). Fitness-for-purpose of models used in this report is discussed in 
Chapter 3 (Section 3.8.4) for the global scale, in Chapter 10 (Section 10.3) for regional climate, and in the 
other chapters at the process level. 
 
Typical strategies for enhancing the fitness-for-purpose of a model include increasing resolution in order to 
explicitly simulate key processes, improving relevant parameterizations, and careful tuning. Changes to a 
model that enhance its fitness for one purpose can sometimes decrease its fitness for others, by upsetting a 
pre-existing balance of approximations. When it is unclear whether a model is fit for a purpose of interest, 
there is often a closely-related purpose for which the evidence of fitness is clearer; for example, it might be 
unclear whether a model is fit for providing highly accurate projections of precipitation changes in a region, 
but reasonable to think that the model is fit for providing projections of precipitation changes that cannot yet 
be ruled out (Parker, 2009). Such information about plausible or credible changes can be useful to inform 
adaptation. Note that challenges associated with assessing model fitness-for-purpose need not prevent 
reaching conclusions with high confidence if there are multiple other lines of evidence supporting those 
same conclusions. 
 
 
### 1.5.4.2  Ensemble modelling techniques 
 
A key approach in climate science is the comparison of results from multiple model simulations with each 
other and against observations. These simulations have typically been performed by separate models with 
consistent boundary conditions and prescribed emissions or radiative forcings, as in the Coupled Model 
Intercomparison Project phases (CMIP, Meehl et al., 2000, 2007a; Taylor et al., 2012; Eyring et al., 2016). 
Such multi-model ensembles (MMEs) have proven highly useful in sampling and quantifying model 
uncertainty, within and between generations of climate models. They also reduce the influence on 
projections of the particular sets of parametrizations and physical components simulated by individual 
models. The primary usage of MMEs is to provide a well quantified model range, but when used carefully 
they can also increase confidence in projections (Knutti et al., 2010). Presently, however, many models also 
share provenance (Masson and Knutti, 2011) and may have common biases that should be acknowledged 
when presenting and building on MME-derived conclusions (Boé, 2018; Abramowitz et al., 2019) (see 
Section 1.5.4.6). 
 
Since AR5, an increase in computing power has made it possible to investigate simulated internal variability 
and to provide robust estimates of forced model responses, using Large Initial Condition Ensembles (ICEs), 
also referred to as Single Model Initial condition Large Ensembles (SMILEs). Examples using GCMs or 
ESMs that support assessments in AR6 include the CESM Large Ensemble (Kay et al., 2015), the MPI 
Grand Ensemble (Maher et al., 2019), and the CanESM2 large ensembles (Kirchmeier-Young et al., 2017). 
Such ensembles employ a single GCM or ESM in a fixed configuration, but starting from a variety of 
different initial states. In some experiments, these initial states only differ slightly. As the climate system is 
chaotic, such tiny changes in initial conditions lead to different evolutions for the individual realizations of 
the system as a whole. Other experiments start from a set of well-separated ocean initial conditions to sample 
the uncertainty in the circulation state of the ocean and its role in longer-timescale variations. These two 
types of ICEs have been referred to as ‘micro’ and ‘macro’ perturbation ensembles respectively (Hawkins et 
al., 2016). In support of this report, most models contributing to CMIP6 have produced ensembles of 
multiple realizations of their historical and scenario simulations (see Chapters 3 and 4). 
 
Recently, the ICE technique has been extended to atmosphere-only simulations (Mizuta et al., 2017), single-
forcer influences such as volcanic eruptions (Bethke et al., 2017) to regional modelling (Mote et al., 2015; 
Fyfe et al., 2017; Schaller et al., 2018; Leduc et al., 2019) and to attribution of extreme weather events using 
crowd-sourced computing (climateprediction.net; Massey et al., 2015).  
 
ICEs can also be used to evaluate climate model parameterizations, if models are initialized appropriately 
(Phillips et al., 2004; Williams et al., 2013), mostly within the framework of seamless weather and climate 
predictions (e.g., Palmer et al., 2008; Hurrell et al., 2009; Brown et al., 2012). Initializing an atmospheric 
model in hindcast mode and observing the biases as they develop permits testing of the parameterized 
processes, by starting from a known state rather than one dominated by quasi-random short term variability 
(Williams et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2014; Vannière et al., 2014). However, single-model initial-conditions 
ensembles cannot cover the same degrees of freedom as a multi-model ensemble, because model 
characteristics substantially affect model behaviour (Flato et al., 2013). 
 
A third common modelling technique is the perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE; note that the abbreviation 
also sometimes refers to the sub-category ‘perturbed physics ensemble’). These methods are used to assess 
uncertainty based on a single model, with individual parameters perturbed to reflect the full range of their 
uncertainty (Murphy et al., 2004; Knutti et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2011; Shiogama et al., 2014). Statistical 
methods can then be used to detect which parameters are the main causes of uncertainty across the ensemble. 
PPEs have been used frequently in simpler models, such as EMICs, and are being applied to more complex 
models. A caveat of PPEs is that the estimated uncertainty will depend on the specific parameterizations of 
the underlying model and may well be an underestimation of the ‘true’ uncertainty. It is also challenging to 
disentangle forced responses from internal variability using a PPE alone.  
 
Together, the three ensemble methods (MMEs, ICEs, PPEs) allow investigation of climate model uncertainty 
arising from internal variability, initial and internal boundary conditions, model formulations and 
parameterizations (Parker, 2013). Figure 1.21 illustrates the different ensemble types. Recent studies have 
also started combining multiple ensemble types or using ensembles in combination with statistical analytical 
techniques. For example, Murphy et al. (2018) combine MMEs and PPEs to give a fuller assessment of 
modelling uncertainty. Wagman and Jackson (2018) use PPEs to evaluate the robustness of MME-based 
emergent constraints. Sexton et al. (2019) study the robustness of ICE approaches by identifying parameters 
and processes responsible for model errors at the two different timescales.  
 
Overall, we assess that increases in computing power and the broader availability of larger and more varied 
ensembles of model simulations have contributed to better estimations of uncertainty in projections of future 
change (high confidence). Note, however, that despite their widespread use in climate science today, the cost 
of the ensemble approach in human and computational resources, and the challenges associated with the 
interpretation of multi-model ensembles, has been questioned (Palmer and Stevens, 2019; Touzé-Peiffer et 
al., 2020).

### 1.5.4.3  The sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) 
 
The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) provides a framework to compare the results of 
different GCMs or ESMs performing similar experiments. Since its creation in the mid-1990s, it has evolved 
in different phases, involving all major climate modelling centres in the world (Figure 1.20). The results of 
these phases have played a key role in previous IPCC reports, and the present Report assesses a range of 
results from CMIP5 that were not published until after the AR5, as well as the first results of the 6th phase of 
CMIP (CMIP6) (Eyring et al., 2016). The CMIP6 experiment design is somewhat different from previous 
phases. It now consists of a limited set of DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) 
simulations and an historical simulation that must be performed by all participating models, as well as a wide 
range of CMIP6-endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) covering specialized topics (Eyring et al., 
2016) (see Figure 1.22). Each MIP activity consists of a series of model experiments, documented in the 
literature (see Table 1.3) and in an online database (https://es-doc.org, see Pascoe et al. (2019) and Annex II).  
 
The CMIP DECK simulations form the basis for a range of assessments and projections in the following 
chapters. As in CMIP5, they consist of a ‘pre-industrial’ control simulation (piControl, where ‘pre-industrial’ 
is taken as fixed 1850 conditions in these experiments), an idealized, abrupt quadrupling of CO2 
concentrations relative to piControl (to estimate equilibrium climate sensitivity), a 1% per year increase in 
CO2 concentrations relative to piControl (to estimate the transient climate response), and a transient 
simulation with prescribed sea-surface temperatures for the period 1979–2014 (termed ‘AMIP’ for historical 
reasons). In addition, all participating models perform a historical simulation for the period 1850–2014. For 
the latter, common CMIP6 forcings are prescribed (Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Table 2). Depending on the 
model setup, these include emissions and concentrations of short-lived species (Hoesly et al., 2018; Gidden 
et al., 2019), long-lived greenhouse gases (Meinshausen et al., 2017), biomass burning emissions (van Marle 
et al., 2017), global gridded land use forcing data (Ma et al., 2020a), solar forcing (Matthes et al., 2017), and 
stratospheric aerosol data from volcanoes (Zanchettin et al., 2016). The methods for generating gridded 
datasets are described in (Feng et al., 2019). For AMIP simulations, common sea surface temperatures 
(SSTs) and sea ice concentrations (SICs) are prescribed. For simulations with prescribed aerosol abundances 
(i.e., not calculated from emissions), optical properties and fractional changes in cloud droplet effective 
radius are generally prescribed in order to provide a more consistent representation of aerosol forcing 
relative to earlier CMIP phases (Fiedler et al., 2017; Stevens et al., 2017). For models without ozone 
chemistry, time-varying gridded ozone concentrations and nitrogen deposition are also provided (Checa-
Garcia et al., 2018). 
  
Beyond the DECK and the historical simulations, the CMIP6-endorsed MIPs aim to investigate how models 
respond to specific forcings, their potential systematic biases, their variability, and their responses to detailed 
future scenarios such as the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs, Section 1.6). Table 1.3 lists the 23 
CMIP6-endorsed MIPs and key references. Results from a range of these MIPs, and many others outside of 
the most recent CMIP6 cycle, will be assessed in the following chapters (also shown in Table 1.3). 
References to all the CMIP6 datasets used in the report are found in Annex II, Table AII.10.

### 1.5.4.4  Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX)   
 
The Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX, Gutowski Jr. et al., 2016) is an 
intercomparison project for regional models and statistical downscaling techniques, coordinating simulations 
on common domains and under common experimental conditions in a similar way to the CMIP effort. 
Dynamical and statistical downscaling techniques can provide higher-resolution climate information than is 
available directly from global climate models (Chapter 10, Section 10.3). These techniques require 
evaluation and quantification of their performance before they can be considered appropriate as usable 
regional climate information or be used in support of climate services. CORDEX simulations have been 
provided by a range of regional downscaling models, for 14 regions together covering much of the globe 
(Atlas, Figure Atlas.7), and they are used extensively in the AR6 WGI Atlas (Atlas.1.4; see also Annex II). 
 
In support of AR6, CORDEX has undertaken a new experiment (CORDEX-CORE) where regional climate 
models downscale a common set of global model simulations, performed at a coarser resolution, to a spatial 
resolution spanning from 12 to 25 km over most of the CORDEX domains (Atlas, Box Atlas.1). CORDEX-
CORE represents an improved level of coordinated intercomparison of downscaling models (Remedio et al., 
2019).  
 
 
### 1.5.4.5  Model Evaluation Tools  
 
For the first time in CMIP, a range of comprehensive evaluation tools are now available that can run 
alongside the commonly used distributed data platform Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF, see Annex II), 
to produce comprehensive results as soon as the model output is published to the CMIP archive.  
 
For instance, the Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool; Eyring et al., 2020; Lauer et al., 2020; 
Righi et al., 2020) is used by a number of chapters. It is an open-source community software tool that 
includes a large variety of diagnostics and performance metrics relevant for coupled Earth System processes, 
such as for the mean, variability and trends, and it can also examine emergent constraints (see Section 
1.5.4.7). ESMValTool also includes routines provided by the WMO Expert Team on Climate Change 
Detection and Indices for the evaluation of extreme events (Min et al., 2011; Sillmann et al., 2013) and 
diagnostics for key processes and variability. Another example of evaluation tool is the CLIVAR 2020 
ENSO metrics package (Planton et al., 2021).  
 
These tools are used in several chapters of this report for the creation of the figures that show CMIP results. 
Together with the Interactive Atlas, they allow for traceability of key results, and an additional level of 
quality control on whether published figures can be reproduced. It also provides the capability to update 
published figures with, as much as possible, the same set of models in all figures, and to assess model 
improvements across different phases of CMIP (Chapter 3, Section 3.8.2).  
 
These new developments are facilitated by the definition of common formats for CMIP model output (Balaji 
et al., 2018) and the availability of reanalyses and observations in the same format as CMIP output 
(obs4MIPs, Ferraro et al., 2015). The tools are also used to support routine evaluation at individual model 
centres and simplify the assessment of improvements of individual models or generations of model 
ensembles (Eyring et al., 2019). Note, however, that while tools such as ESMValTool can produce an 
estimate of overall model performance, dedicated model evaluation still needs to be performed when 
analysing projections for a particular purpose, such as assessing changing hazards in a given particular 
region. Such evaluation is discussed in the next section, and in greater detail in later chapters of this Report. 
 
 
### 1.5.4.6  Evaluation of process-based models against observations  
 
Techniques used for evaluating process-based climate models against observations were assessed in AR5 
(Flato et al., 2013), and have progressed rapidly since (Eyring et al., 2019). The most widely used technique 
is to compare climatologies (long-term averages of specific climate variables) or time series of simulated 
(process-based) model output with observations, considering the observational uncertainty. A further 
approach is to compare the results of process-based models with those from statistical models. In addition to 
a comparison of climatological means, trends and variability, AR5 already made use of a large set of 
performance metrics for a quantitative evaluation of the models. 
  
Since AR5, a range of studies has investigated model agreement with observations well beyond large scale 
mean climate properties (e.g., Bellenger et al., 2014; Covey et al., 2016; Pendergrass and Deser, 2017; 
Goelzer et al., 2018; Beusch et al., 2020a), providing information on the performance of recent model 
simulations across multiple variables and components of the Earth system (e.g., Anav et al., 2013; Guan and 
Waliser, 2017). Based on such studies, this Report assesses model improvements across different CMIP 
DECK, CMIP6 historical and CMIP6-Endorsed MIP simulations, and of differences in model performance 
between different classes of models, such as high- versus low-resolution models (see e.g., Chapter 3, Section 
3.8.2). 
 
In addition, process- or regime-oriented evaluation of models has been expanded since AR5. By focusing on 
processes, causes of systematic errors in the models can be identified and insights can be gained as to 
whether a mean state or trend is correctly simulated for the right reasons. This approach is commonly used 
for the evaluation of clouds (e.g., Williams and Webb, 2009; Konsta et al., 2012; Bony et al., 2015; Dal 
Gesso et al., 2015; Jin et al., 2017), dust emissions (e.g., Parajuli et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016) as well as 
aerosol-cloud (e.g., Gryspeerdt and Stier, 2012) and chemistry-climate (SPARC, 2010) interactions. Process-
oriented diagnostics have also been used to evaluate specific phenomena such as the El Niño Southern 
Oscillation (ENSO, Guilyardi et al., 2016), the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO; Ahn et al., 2017; Jiang et 
al., 2018), Southern Ocean clouds (Hyder et al., 2018), monsoons (Boo et al., 2011; James et al., 2015), and 
tropical cyclones (Kim et al., 2018). 
 
Instrument simulators provide estimates of what a satellite would see if looking down on the model 
simulated planet, and improve the direct comparison of modelled variables such as clouds, precipitation and 
upper tropospheric humidity with observations from satellites (e.g., Kay et al., 2011; Klein et al., 2013; 
Cesana and Waliser, 2016; Konsta et al., 2016; Jin et al., 2017; Chepfer et al., 2018; Swales et al., 2018; 
Zhang et al., 2018). Within the framework of the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) 
contribution to CMIP6 (Webb et al., 2017), a new version of the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison 
Project Observational Simulator (COSP, Swales et al., 2018) has been released which makes use of a 
collection of observation proxies or satellite simulators. Related approaches in this rapidly evolving field 
include simulators for Arctic Ocean observations (Burgard et al., 2020) and measurements of aerosol 
observations along aircraft trajectories (Watson-Parris et al., 2019).  
 
In this Report, model evaluation is performed in the individual chapters, rather than in a separate chapter as 
was the case for AR5. This applies to the model types discussed above, and also to dedicated models of 
subsystems that are not (or not yet) part of usual climate models, for example, glacier or ice sheet models 
(Annex II). Further discussions are found in Chapter 3 (attribution), Chapter 5 (carbon cycle), Chapter 6 
(short-lived climate forcers), Chapter 8 (water cycle), Chapter 9 (ocean, cryosphere and sea level), Chapter 
10 (regional scale information) and the Atlas (regional models). 
 
 
### 1.5.4.7  Emergent constraints on climate feedbacks, sensitivities and projections  
 
An emergent constraint is the relationship between an uncertain aspect of future climate change and an 
observable feature of the Earth System, evident across an ensemble of models (Allen and Ingram, 2002; 
Mystakidis et al., 2016; Wenzel et al., 2016; Hall et al., 2019; Winkler et al., 2019). Complex Earth System 
Models (ESMs) simulate variations on timescales from hours to centuries, telling us how aspects of the 
current climate relate to its sensitivity to anthropogenic forcing. Where an ensemble of different ESMs 
displays a relationship between a short-term observable variation and a longer-term sensitivity, an 
observation of the short-term variation in the real world can be converted, via the model-based relationship, 
into an ‘emergent constraint’ on the sensitivity. This is shown schematically in Figure 1.23 (Eyring et al., 
2019), see also Annex VII: Glossary. 
 
Emergent constraints use the spread in model projections to estimate the sensitivities of the climate system to 
anthropogenic forcing, providing another type of ensemble-wide information that is not readily available 
from simulations with one ESM alone. As emergent constraints depend on identifying those observable 
aspects of the climate system that are most related to climate projections, they also help to focus model 
evaluation on the most relevant observations (Hall et al., 2019). However, there is a chance that 
indiscriminate data-mining of the multi-dimensional outputs from ESMs could lead to spurious correlations 
(Caldwell et al., 2014; Wagman and Jackson, 2018) and less than robust emergent constraints on future 
changes (Bracegirdle and Stephenson, 2013). To avoid this, emergent constraints need to be tested ‘out of 
sample’ on parts of the dataset that were not included in its construction (Caldwell et al., 2018) and should 
also always be based on sound physical understanding and mathematical theory (Hall et al., 2019). Their 
conclusions should also be reassessed when a new generation of MMEs becomes available, such as CMIP6. 
As an example, Chapter 7 (Section 7.5.4) discusses and assesses recent studies where equilibrium climate 
sensitivities (ECS) diagnosed in a multi-model ensemble are compared with the same models’ estimates of 
an observable quantity, such as post-1970s global warming or tropical sea-surface temperatures of past 
climates like the last glacial maximum or the Pliocene. Assessments of other emergent constraints appear 
throughout later chapters, such as Chapter 4 (Section 4.2.5), Chapter 5 (Section 5.4.6) and Chapter 7 (Section 
7.5.4). 
 
<figref>1.23</figref> 
 
### 1.5.4.8  Weighting techniques for model comparisons  
 
Assessments of climate model ensembles have commonly assumed that each individual model is of equal 
value (‘model democracy’) and when combining simulations to estimate the mean and variance of quantities 
of interest, they are typically unweighted (Haughton et al., 2015). This practice has been noted to diminish 
the influence of models exhibiting a good match with observations (Tapiador et al., 2020). However, 
exceptions to this approach exist, notably AR5 projections of sea ice, which only selected a few models 
which passed a model performance assessment (Collins et al., 2013), and more studies on this topic have 
appeared since the AR5 (e.g., Eyring et al., 2019). Ensembles are typically sub-selected by removing either 
poorly performing model simulations (McSweeney et al., 2015) or model simulations that are perceived to 
add little additional information, typically where multiple simulations have come from the same model. They 
may also be weighted based on model performance. 
 
Several recent studies have attempted to quantify the effect of various strategies for selection or weighting of 
ensemble members based on some set of criteria (Haughton et al., 2015; Olonscheck and Notz, 2017; 
Sanderson et al., 2017). Model weighting strategies have been further employed since AR5 to reduce the 
spread in climate projections for a given scenario by using weights based on one or more model performance 
metrics (Wenzel et al., 2016; Knutti et al., 2017; Sanderson et al., 2017; Lorenz et al., 2018; Liang et al., 
2020). However, models may share representations of processes, parameterization schemes, or even parts of 
code, leading to common biases. The models may therefore not be fully independent, calling into question 
inferences derived from multi-model ensembles (Abramowitz et al., 2019). Emergent constraints (see 
Section 1.5.4.5) also represent an implicit weighting technique that explicitly links present performance to 
future projections (Bracegirdle and Stephenson, 2013). 
 
Concern has been raised about the large extent to which code is shared within the CMIP5 multi-model 
ensemble (Sanderson et al., 2015a). Boé (2018) showed that a clear relationship exists between the number 
of components shared by climate models and how similar the simulations are. The resulting similarities in 
behaviour need to be accounted for in the generation of best-estimate multi-model climate projections. This 
has led to calls to move beyond equally-weighted multi-model means towards weighted means that take into 
account both model performance and model independence (Sanderson et al., 2015b, 2017; Knutti et al., 
2017). Model independence has been defined in terms of performance differences within an ensemble 
(Masson and Knutti, 2011; Knutti et al., 2013, 2017, Sanderson et al., 2015b, 2015a, 2017; Lorenz et al., 
2018). However, this definition is sensitive to the choice of variable, observational data set, metric, time 
period, and region, and a performance ranked ensemble has been shown to sometimes perform worse than a 
random selection (Herger et al., 2018a). The adequacy of the constraint provided by the data and 
experimental methods can be tested using a calibration-validation style partitioning of observations into two 
sets (Bishop and Abramowitz, 2013), or a ‘perfect model approach’ where one of the ensemble members is 
treated as the reference dataset and all model weights are calibrated against it (Bishop and Abramowitz, 
2013; Wenzel et al., 2016; Knutti et al., 2017; Sanderson et al., 2017; Herger et al., 2018a, 2018b). Sunyer et 
al. (2014) use a Bayesian framework to account for model dependencies and changes in model biases. Annan 
and Hargreaves (2017) provides a statistical, quantifiable definition of independence that is independent of 
performance-based measures.  
 
The AR5 quantified uncertainty in CMIP5 climate projections by selecting one realization per model per 
scenario, and calculating the 5–95% range of the resulting ensemble (see Chapter 4, Box 4.1) and the same 
strategy is generally still used in AR6. Broadly, the following chapters take the CMIP6 5–95% ensemble 
range as the likely uncertainty range for projections8, with no further weighting or consideration of model 
ancestry and as long as no universal, robust method for weighting a multi-model projection ensemble is 
available (Box 4.1, Chapter 4). A notable exception to this approach is the assessment of future changes in 
global surface air temperature (GSAT), which also draws on the updated best estimate and range of 
equilibrium climate sensitivity assessed in Chapter 7. For a thorough description of the model weighting 
choices made in this Report, and the assessment of GSAT, see Chapter 4 (Box 4.1). Model selection and 
weighting in downscaling approaches for regional assessment is discussed in Chapter 10 (Section 10.3.4). 
 
 
# 1.6  Dimensions of Integration: Scenarios, global warming levels and cumulative carbon emissions  
 
This section introduces three ways to synthesize climate change knowledge across topics and chapters. These 
‘dimensions of integration’ include (1) emission and concentration scenarios underlying the climate change 
projections assessed in this report, (2) levels of global mean surface warming relative to the 1850-1900 
baseline (‘global warming levels’), and (3) cumulative carbon emissions (Figure 1.24). All three dimensions 
can, in principle, be used to synthesize physical science knowledge across WGI, and also across climate 
change impacts, adaptation, and mitigation research. Scenarios, in particular, have a long history of serving 
as a common reference point within and across IPCC Working Groups and research communities. Similarly, 
cumulative carbon emissions and global warming levels provide key links between WGI assessments and 
those of the other WGs; these two dimensions frame the cause-effect chain investigated by WGI. The closest 
links to WGIII are the emissions scenarios, as WGIII considers drivers of emissions and climate change 
mitigation options. The links to WGII are the geophysical climate projections from the Earth System Models 
which the climate impacts and adaptation literature often uses as their starting point. 
 
<figref>1.24</figref> 
 
The section is structured as follows: first, the scenarios used in AR6 are introduced and discussed in relation 
to scenarios used in earlier IPCC assessments (Section 1.6.1). Cross-Chapter Box 1.4 provides an overview 
of the new scenarios and how they are used in this report. Next, the two additional dimensions of integration 
are introduced: global warming levels (Section 1.6.2) and cumulative emissions (Section 1.6.3). Net zero 
emissions are discussed in Box 1.4. The relation between global warming levels and scenarios is further 
assessed in Cross-Chapter Box 11.1 in Chapter 11.  
 
 
## 1.6.1  Scenarios 
 
A scenario is a description of how the future may develop based on a coherent and internally consistent set 
of assumptions about key drivers including demography, economic processes, technological innovation, 
governance, lifestyles and relationships among these driving forces (IPCC, 2000; Rounsevell and Metzger, 
2010; O’Neill et al., 2014; see Section 1.6.1.1). Scenarios can also be defined by geophysical driving forces 
only, such as emissions or abundances of greenhouse gases, aerosols, and aerosol precursors or land use 
patterns. Scenarios are not predictions; instead, they provide a ‘what-if’ investigation of the implications of 
various developments and actions (Moss et al., 2010). WGI investigates potential future climate change 
principally by assessing climate model simulations using emission scenarios originating from the WGIII 
community (Section 1.6.1.2). The scenarios used in this WGI report cover various hypothetical ‘baseline 
scenarios’ or ‘reference futures’ that could unfold in the absence of any or any additional climate policies 
(see Annex VII: Glossary). These ‘reference scenarios’ originate from a comprehensive analysis of a wide 
array of socio-economic drivers, such as population growth, technological development, and economic 
development, and their broad spectrum of associated energy, land use and emission implications (Riahi et al., 
2017). With direct policy relevance to the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C and ‘well below’ 2°C goals, this report 
also assesses climate futures where the effects of additional climate change mitigation action are explored, 
i.e., so-called mitigation scenarios (for a broader discussion on scenarios and futures analysis, see Cross-
Chapter Box 1, Table 1 in SRCCL, IPCC, 2019b).  
 
For this Report, the main emissions, concentration and land use scenarios considered are a subset of 
scenarios recently developed using the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways framework (SSPs) (Riahi et al., 
2017; see Section 1.6.1.1 and Cross-Chapter Box 1.4). Initially, the term ‘SSP’ described five broad 
narratives of future socio-economic development only (O’Neill et al., 2014). However, at least in the WGI 
community, the term ‘SSP scenario’ is now more widely used to refer directly to future emission and 
concentration scenarios that result from combining these socio-economic development pathways with 
climate change mitigation assumptions. These are assessed in detail in WGIII (WGIII, Chapter 3; Cross-
Chapter Box 1.4, Table 1).  
 
The WGI report uses a core set of five SSP scenarios to assist cross-Chapter integration and cross-WG 
applications: SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 (Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Table 1). 
These scenarios span a wide range of plausible societal and climatic futures from potentially below 1.5°C 
best-estimate warming to over 4°C warming by 2100 (Figure 1.25). The set of five SSP scenarios includes 
those in ‘Tier 1’ simulations of the CMIP6 ScenarioMIP intercomparison project (O’Neill et al., 2016; see 
Section 1.5.4) that participating climate modelling groups were asked to prioritize (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, 
SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5), plus the low emission scenario SSP1-1.9. SSP1-1.9 is used in combination with 
SSP1-2.6 to explore differential outcomes of approximately 1.5 and 2.0 °C warming relative to pre-industrial 
levels, relevant to the Paris Agreement goals. Further SSP scenarios are used in this report to assess specific 
aspects, e.g., air pollution policies in Chapter 6 (Cross-Chapter Box 1.4). In addition, the previous generation 
of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) is also used in this report when assessing future climate 
change (Section 1.6.1.3; Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Table 1).  
 
Climatic changes over the 21st century (and beyond) are projected and assessed in subsequent chapters, 
using a broad range of climate models, conditional on the various SSP scenarios. The projected future 
changes can then be put into the context of longer-term paleoclimate data and historical observations, 
showing how the higher emission and higher concentration scenarios diverge further from the range of 
climate conditions that ecosystems and human societies experienced in the past 2000 years in terms of global 
mean temperature and other key climate variables (Figure 1.26; see also Figure 1.5). 
 
<figref>1.25</figref>
 
While scenarios are a key tool for integration across IPCC Working Groups, they also allow the integration 
of knowledge among scientific communities and across timescales. For example, agricultural yield, 
infrastructure and human health impacts of increased drought frequency, extreme rainfall events and 
hurricanes are often examined in isolation. New insights on climate impacts in WGII can be gained if 
compound effects of multiple cross-sectoral impacts are considered across multiple research communities 
under consistent scenario frameworks (Leonard et al., 2014; Warszawski et al., 2014; see also Chapter 11, 
Section 11.8). Similarly, a synthesis of WGI knowledge on sea level rise contributions is enabled by a 
consistent application of future scenarios across all specialised research communities, such as ice-sheet mass 
balance analyses, glacier loss projections and thermosteric change from ocean heat uptake (e.g. Kopp et al., 
2014; see Chapter 9). 
 
<figref>1.26</figref>
 
In addition to the comprehensive SSP scenario set and the RCPs, multiple idealized scenarios and time-slice 
experiments using climate models are assessed in this report. Idealized scenarios refer to experiments where, 
for example, CO2 concentrations are increased by 1% per year, or instantly quadrupled. Such idealized 
experiments have been extensively used in previous model intercomparison projects and constitute the core 
‘DECK’ set of model experiments of CMIP6 (see Section 1.5.4). They are, for example, used to diagnose the 
patterns of climate feedbacks across the suite of models assessed in this report (Chapter 7).  
 
In the following, we further introduce the SSP scenarios and how they relate to the Shared Socioeconomic 
Pathways framework (Section 1.6.1.1), describe the scenario generation process (Section 1.6.1.2), and 
provide a historical review of scenarios used in IPCC assessment reports (Section 1.6.1.3), before briefly 
discussing questions of scenario likelihood, scenario uncertainty and the use of scenario storylines (Section 
1.6.1.4). 
 
 
### 1.6.1.1  Shared Socio-economic Pathways  
 
The Shared Socioeconomic Pathways SSP1 to SSP5 describe a range of plausible trends in the evolution of 
society over the 21st century. They were developed in order to connect a wide range of research 
communities (Nakicenovic et al., 2014) and consist of two main elements: a set of qualitative, narrative 
storylines describing societal futures (O’Neill et al., 2017a) and a set of quantified measures of development 
at aggregated and/or spatially resolved scales. Each pathway is an internally consistent, plausible and 
integrated description of a socio-economic future, but these socio-economic futures do not account for the 
effects of climate change, and no new climate policies are assumed. The SSPs’ quantitative projections of 
socio-economic drivers include population, gross domestic product (GDP) and urbanization (Dellink et al., 
2017; Jiang and O’Neill, 2017; Samir and Lutz, 2017). By design, the SSPs differ in terms of the socio-
economic challenges they present for climate change mitigation and adaptation (Rothman et al., 2014; 
Schweizer and O’Neill, 2014) and the evolution of these drivers within each SSP reflects this design. 
Broadly, the five SSPs represent ‘sustainability’ (SSP1), a ‘middle of the road’ path (SSP2), ‘regional 
rivalry’ (SSP3), ‘inequality’ (SSP4), and ‘fossil fuel intensive’ development (SSP5) (Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, 
Figure 1) (O’Neill et al., 2017a). More specific information on the SSP framework and the assumptions 
underlying the SSPs will be provided in the IPCC WGIII report (WGIII, Chapter 3; see also Box SPM.1 in 
SRCCL (IPCC, 2019d)). 
 
The SSP narratives and drivers were used to develop scenarios of energy use, air pollution control, land use 
and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions developments using integrated assessment models (IAMs) (Riahi et 
al., 2017; Rogelj et al., 2018a). An IAM can derive multiple emission futures for each socio-economic 
development pathway, assuming no new mitigation policies or various levels of additional mitigation action 
(in the case of reference scenarios and mitigation scenarios, respectively (Riahi et al., 2017). By design, the 
evolution of drivers and emissions within the SSP scenarios do not take into account the effects of climate 
change. 
 
The SSPX-Y scenarios and the RCP scenarios are categorized similarly, by reference to the approximate 
radiative forcing levels each one entails at the end of the 21st century. For example, the ‘1.9’ in the SSP1-1.9 
scenario stands for an approximate radiative forcing level of 1.9 W m-2 in 2100. The first number (X) in the 
‘SSPX-Y’ acronym refers to one of the five shared socio-economic development pathways (Cross-Chapter 
Box 1.4, Figure 1; Table 1.4). 
 
<tableref>1.4</tableref> 
 
This SSP scenario categorisation, focused on end-of-century radiative forcing levels, reflects how scenarios 
were conceptualized until recently, namely, to reach a particular climate target in 2100 at the lowest cost and 
irrespective of whether the target was exceeded over the century. More recently, and in particular since the 
IPCC SR1.5 report focused attention on peak warming scenarios (Rogelj et al., 2018b), scenario 
development started to explicitly consider peak warming, cumulative emissions and the amount of net 
negative emissions (Rogelj et al., 2018b; Fujimori et al., 2019).  
 
The SSP scenarios can be used for either emission- or concentration-driven model experiments (Cross-
Chapter Box 1.4). ESMs can be run with emissions and concentrations data for GHGs and aerosols and land 
use or landcover maps and calculate levels of radiative forcing internally. The radiative forcing labels of the 
RCP and SSP scenarios, such as ‘2.6’ in RCP2.6 or SSP1-2.6, are thus approximate labels for the year 2100 
only. The actual global mean effective radiative forcing varies across ESMs due to different radiative 
transfer schemes, uncertainties in aerosol-cloud interactions and different feedback mechanisms, among 
other reasons. Nonetheless, using approximate radiative forcing labels is advantageous because it establishes 
a clear categorization of scenarios, with multiple climate forcings and different combinations in those 
scenarios summarized in a single number. The classifications according to cumulative carbon emissions (see 
Section 1.6.3) and global warming level (see Section 1.6.2 and Cross-Chapter Box 7.1 on emulators in 
Chapter 7) complement those forcing labels.  
 
A key advance of the SSP scenarios relative to the RCPs is a wider span of assumptions on future air quality 
mitigation measures, and hence emissions of short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) (Rao et al., 2017; Lund et 
al., 2020). This allows for a more detailed investigation into the relative roles of GHG and SLCF emissions 
in future global and regional climate change, and hence the implications of policy choices. For instance, 
SSP1-2.6 builds on an assumption of stringent air quality mitigation policy, leading to rapid reductions in 
particle emissions, while SSP3-7.0 assumes slow improvements, with pollutant emissions over the 21st 
century comparable to current levels (Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Figure 2, Chapter 6, Figure 6.19). 
 
One limitation of the SSP scenarios used for CMIP6 and in this Report is that they reduce emissions from all 
the major ozone-depleting substances controlled under the Montreal Protocol (CFCs, halons, and 
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs)) uniformly, rather than representing a fuller range of possible high and 
low emission futures (UNEP, 2016). Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions, on the other hand, span a wider 
range within the SSPs than in the RCPs (Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Figure 2).  
 
The SSP scenarios and previous RCP scenarios are not directly comparable. First, the gas-to-gas 
compositions differ; for example, the SSP5-8.5 scenario has higher CO2 concentrations but lower methane 
concentrations compared to RCP8.5. Second, the projected 21st-century trajectories may differ, even if they 
result in the same radiative forcing by 2100. Third, the overall effective radiative forcing (see Chapter 7) 
may differ, and tends to be higher for the SSPs compared to RCPs that share the same nominal stratospheric-
temperature adjusted radiative forcing label. The stratospheric-temperature adjusted radiative forcings of the 
SSPs and RCPs, however, remain relatively close, at least by 2100 (Tebaldi et al., 2021). In summary, 
differences in, for example, CMIP5 RCP8.5 and CMIP6 SSP5-8.5 ESM outputs, are partially due to different 
scenario characteristics rather than different ESM characteristics only (Chapter 4, Section 4.6.2).  
 
When investigating various mitigation futures, WGIII goes beyond the core set of SSP scenarios assessed in 
WGI (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, etc.) to consider the characteristics of more than 1000 scenarios (see Cross-
Chapter Box 7.1 in Chapter 7). In addition, while staying within the framework of socio-economic 
development pathways (SSP1 to SSP5), WGIII also considers various mitigation possibilities through so-
called illustrative pathways (IPs). These illustrative pathways help to highlight key narratives in the literature 
concerning various technological, social and behavioral options for mitigation, various timings for 
implementation, or varying emphasis on different GHG and land use options. Just as with the SSPX-Y 
scenarios considered in this report, these illustrative pathways can be placed in relation to the matrix of SSP 
families and approximate radiative forcing levels in 2100 (see Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Figure 1 and Working 
Group III, Chapter 3).  
 
No likelihood is attached to the scenarios assessed in this report, and the feasibility of specific scenarios in 
relation to current trends is best informed by the WGIII contribution to AR6. In the scenario literature, the 
plausibility of the high emissions levels underlying scenarios such as RCP8.5 or SSP5-8.5 has been debated 
in light of recent developments in the energy sector. (see Section 1.6.1.4). 
 
<boxref>Cross-Chapter Box 1.4</boxref> 
 
### 1.6.1.2  Scenario generation process for CMIP6 
 
The scenario generation process involves research communities linked to all three IPCC Working Groups 
(Figure 1.27). It generally starts in the scientific communities associated with WGII and WGIII with the 
definition of new socio-economic scenario storylines (IPCC, 2000; O’Neill et al., 2014) that are quantified in 
terms of their drivers, i.e., GDP, population, technology, energy and land use and their resulting emissions 
(Riahi et al., 2017). Then, numerous complementation and harmonisation steps are necessary for datasets 
within the WGI and WGIII science communities, including gridding emissions of anthropogenic short-lived 
forcers, providing open biomass burning emission estimates, preparing land use patterns, aerosol fields, 
stratospheric and tropospheric ozone, nitrogen deposition datasets, solar irradiance and aerosol optical 
property estimates, and observed and projected greenhouse gas concentration time series (documented for 
CMIP6 through input4mips; Durack et al., 2018; Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Table 2). 
 
Once these datasets are completed, ESMs are run in coordinated model intercomparison projects in the WGI 
science community, using standardized simulation protocols and scenario data. The most recent example of 
such a coordinated effort is the CMIP6 exercise (Eyring et al., 2016; see also Section 1.5.4) with, in 
particular, ScenarioMIP (O’Neill et al., 2016). The WGI science community feeds back climate information 
to WGIII via climate emulators (Cross-Chapter Box 7.1 in Chapter 7) that are updated and calibrated with 
the ESMs’ temperature responses and other lines of evidence. Next, this climate information is used to 
compute several high-level global climate indicators (e.g., atmospheric concentrations, global temperatures) 
for a much wider set of hundreds of scenarios that are assessed as part of IPCC WGIII assessment (WGIII 
Annex C). The outcomes from climate models run under the different scenarios are then used to calculate the 
evolution of climatic impact-drivers (Chapter 12), and utilized by impact researchers together with exposure 
and vulnerability information, in order to characterize risk from future climate change to human and natural 
systems. The climate impacts associated with these scenarios or different warming levels are then assessed as 
part of WGII reports (Figure 1.27). 
 
<figref>1.27</figref> 
 
### 1.6.1.3  History of scenarios within the IPCC 
 
Scenario modelling experiments have been a core element of physical climate science since the first transient 
simulations with a General Circulation Model in 1988 (Hansen et al., 1988; see Section 1.3). Scenarios and 
modelling experiments assessed in IPCC reports have evolved over time, which provides a ‘history of how 
the future was seen’. The starting time for the scenarios moves as actual emissions supersede earlier 
emission assumptions, while new scientific insights into the range of plausible population trends, 
behavioural changes and technology options and other key socioeconomic drivers of emissions also emerge 
(see WGIII; Legget, 1992; IPCC, 2000; Moss et al., 2010; Riahi et al., 2017). Many different sets of climate 
projections have been produced over the past several decades, using different sets of scenarios. Here, we 
compare those earlier scenarios against the most recent ones.  
 
Climate science research involving scenarios necessarily follows a series of consecutive steps (see Figure 
1.27). As each step waits for input from the preceding one, delays often occur that result in the impact 
literature basing its analyses on earlier scenarios than those most current in the climate change mitigation and 
climate system literature. It is hence important to provide an approximate comparison across the various 
scenario generations (Figure 1.28; Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Table 1; Chapter 4).   
 
<figref>1.28</figref> 
 
The first widely used set of IPCC emission scenarios was the IS92 scenarios in 1992 (Leggett et al., 1992). 
Apart from reference scenarios, IS92 also included a set of stabilisation scenarios, the so-called ‘S’ 
scenarios. Those ‘S’ pathways were designed to lead to CO2 stabilisation levels such as 350 ppm or 450 
ppm. By 1996, those latter stabilisation levels were complemented in the scientific literature by alternative 
trajectories that assumed a delayed onset of climate change mitigation action (Figure 1.28; Wigley et al., 
1996). 
 
By 2000, the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) produced the SRES scenarios (IPCC, 
2000), albeit without assuming any climate-policy-induced mitigation. The four broad groups of SRES 
scenarios (scenario ‘families’) A1, A2, B1 and B2 were the first scenarios to emphasize socio-economic 
scenario storylines, and also first to emphasize other greenhouse gases, land use change and aerosols. 
Represented by three scenarios for the high-growth A1 scenario family, those 6 SRES scenarios (A1FI, A1B, 
A1T, A2, B1, and B2) can still sometimes be found in today’s climate impact literature. The void of missing 
climate change mitigation scenarios was filled by a range of community exercises, including the so-called 
post-SRES scenarios (Swart et al., 2002).  
 
The RCP scenarios (van Vuuren et al., 2011) then broke new ground by providing low emission pathways 
that implied strong climate change mitigation including an example with negative CO2 emissions on a large 
scale, namely RCP2.6. As shown in Figure 1.28, the upper end of the scenario range has not substantially 
shifted. Building on the SRES multi-gas scenarios, the RCPs include time series of emissions and 
concentrations of the full suite of greenhouse gases and aerosols and chemically active gases, as well as land 
use and land cover (Moss et al., 2010). The word ‘representative’ signifies that each RCP is only one of 
many possible scenarios that would lead to the specific radiative forcing characteristics. The term pathway 
emphasizes that not only the long-term concentration levels are of interest, but also the trajectory taken over 
time to reach that outcome (Moss et al., 2010). RCPs usually refer to the concentration pathway extending to 
2100, for which IAMs produced corresponding emission scenarios. Four RCPs produced from IAMs were 
selected from the published literature and are used in AR5 as well as in this report, spanning approximately 
the range from below 2°C warming to high (>4°C) warming best-estimates by the end of the 21st century: 
RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Table 1). Extended Concentration 
Pathways (ECPs) describe extensions of the RCPs from 2100 to 2300 that were calculated using simple rules 
generated by stakeholder consultations; these do not represent fully consistent scenarios (Meinshausen et al., 
2011b). 
 
By design, the RCP emission and concentration pathways were originally developed using particular socio-
economic development pathways, but those are no longer considered (Moss et al., 2010). The different levels 
of emissions and climate change represented in the RCPs can hence be explored against the backdrop of 
different socio-economic development pathways (SSP1 to SSP5) (Section 1.6.1.1; Cross-Chapter Box 1.4). 
This integrative SSP-RCP framework (‘SSPX-RCPY’ in Table 1.4) is now widely used in the climate impact 
and policy analysis literature (e.g., ICONICS, 2021; Green et al., 2020; O’Neill et al., 2020), where climate 
projections obtained under the RCP scenarios are analysed against the backdrop of various SSPs. 
Considering various levels of future emissions and climate change for each socio-economic development 
pathway was an evolution from the previous SRES framework (IPCC, 2000), in which socio-economic and 
emission futures were closely aligned. 
 
The new set of scenarios (SSP1-1.9 to SSP5-8.5) now features a higher top level of CO2 emissions (SSP5-8.5 
compared to RCP8.5), although the most significant change is again the addition of a very low climate 
change mitigation scenario (SSP1-1.9, compared to the previous low scenario, RCP2.6). Also, historically, 
none of the previous scenario sets featured a scenario that involves a very pronounced peak-and-decline 
emissions trajectory, but SSP1-1.9 does so now. The full set of nine SSP scenarios now includes a high 
aerosol emission scenario (SSP3-7.0). The RCPs featured more uniformly low aerosol trajectories across all 
scenarios (Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Figure 2). More generally, the SSP scenarios feature a later peak of global 
emission for the lower scenarios, simply as a consequence of historical emissions not having followed the 
trajectory projected by previous low scenarios (Figure 1.28).   
 
Over the last decades, discussions around scenarios have often focussed on whether recent trends make 
certain future scenarios more or less probable or whether all scenarios are too high or too low. When the 
SRES scenarios first appeared, the debate was often whether the scenarios were overestimating actual world 
emissions developments (e.g., Castles and Henderson, 2003). With the strong emissions increase throughout 
the 2000s, that debate then shifted towards the question of whether the lower future climate change 
mitigation scenarios were rendered unfeasible (Pielke et al., 2008; van Vuuren and Riahi, 2008). Historical 
emissions over 2000 to 2010 approximately track the upper half of SRES and RCP projections (Figure 1.28). 
More generally, the global fossil and industrial CO2 emissions of recent decades tracked approximately the 
middle of the projected scenario ranges (see Fig 1.28), although with regional differences (Pedersen et al., 
2020).  
 
 
### 1.6.1.4  The likelihood of reference scenarios, scenario uncertainty and storylines 
 
In general, no likelihood is attached to the scenarios assessed in this Report. The use of different scenarios 
for climate change projections allows to explore ‘scenario uncertainty’ (Collins et al., 2013; SR1.5; see also 
Section 1.4.4). Scenario uncertainty is fundamentally different from geophysical uncertainties, which result 
from limitations in the understanding and predictability of the climate system (Smith and Stern, 2011). In 
scenarios, by contrast, future emissions depend to a large extent on the collective outcome of choices and 
processes related to population dynamics and economic activity, or on choices that affect a given activity’s 
energy and emissions intensity (Jones, 2000; Knutti et al., 2008; Kriegler et al., 2012; van Vuuren et al., 
2014). Even if identical socio-economic futures are assumed, the associated future emissions still face 
uncertainties, since different experts and model frameworks diverge in their estimates of future emission 
ranges (Ho et al., 2019).  
 
When exploring various climate futures, scenarios with no, or no additional, climate policies are often 
referred to as ‘baseline’ or ‘reference scenarios’ (Section 1.6.1.1; Annex VII: Glossary). Among the five core 
scenarios used most in this report, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 are explicit ‘no-climate-policy’ scenarios (Gidden 
et al., 2019; Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Table 1), assuming a carbon price of zero. These future ‘baseline’ 
scenarios are hence counterfactuals that include less climate policies compared to ‘business-as-usual’ 
scenarios – given that ‘business-as-usual’ scenarios could be understood to imply a continuation of existing 
climate policies. Generally, future scenarios are meant to cover a broad range of plausible futures, due for 
example to unforeseen discontinuities in development pathways (Raskin and Swart, 2020), or to large 
uncertainties in underlying long-term projections of economic drivers (Christensen et al., 2018). However, 
the likelihood of high emission scenarios such as RCP8.5 or SSP5-8.5 is considered low in light of recent 
developments in the energy sector (Hausfather and Peters, 2020a, 2020b). Studies that consider possible 
future emission trends in the absence of additional climate policies, such as the recent IEA 2020 World 
Energy Outlook ‘stated policy’ scenario (International Energy Agency, 2020), project approximately 
constant fossil and industrial CO2 emissions out to 2070, approximately in line with the medium RCP4.5, 
RCP6.0 and SSP2-4.5 scenarios (Hausfather and Peters, 2020b) and the 2030 global emission levels that are 
pledged as part of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement (Section 
1.2.2; (Fawcett et al., 2015; Rogelj et al., 2016; UNFCCC, 2016; IPCC, 2018). On the other hand, the default 
concentrations aligned with RCP8.5 or SSP5-8.5 and resulting climate futures derived by ESMs could be 
reached by lower emission trajectories than RCP8.5 or SSP5-8.5. That is because the uncertainty range on 
carbon-cycle feedbacks includes stronger feedbacks than assumed in the default derivation of RCP8.5 and 
SSP5-8.5 concentrations (Ciais et al., 2013; Friedlingstein et al., 2014; Booth et al., 2017; see also Chapter 5, 
Section 5.4). 
 
To address long-term scenario uncertainties, scenario storylines (or ‘narratives’) are often used (Rounsevell 
and Metzger, 2010; O’Neill et al., 2014) (see Section 1.4.4 for a more general discussion on ‘storylines’ also 
covering ‘physical climate storylines’). Scenario storylines are descriptions of a future world, and the related 
large-scale socio-economic development path towards that world that are deemed plausible within the 
current state of knowledge and historical experience (WGIII; Section 1.2.3). Scenario storylines attempt to 
‘stimulate, provoke, and communicate visions of what the future could hold for us’ (Rounsevell and 
Metzger, 2010) in settings where either limited knowledge or inherent unpredictability in social systems 
prevent a forecast or numerical prediction. Scenario storylines have been used in previous climate research, 
and they are the explicit or implicit starting point of any scenario exercise, including for the SRES scenarios 
(IPCC, 2000) and the SSPs (e.g., O’Neill et al., 2017a). 
 
Recent technological or socio-economic trends might be informative for bounding near-term future trends, 
for example, if technological progress renders a mitigation technology cheaper than previously assumed. 
However, short-term emission trends alone do not generally rule out an opposite trend in the future (van 
Vuuren et al., 2010). The ranking of individual RCP emission scenarios from the IAMs with regard to 
emission levels is different for different time horizons, e.g., 2020 versus longer-term emission levels; For 
example, the strongest climate change mitigation scenario RCP2.6 was in fact the second highest CO2 
emission scenario (jointly with RCP4.5) before 2020 in the set of RCPs and the strong global emission 
decline in RCP2.6 only followed after 2020. Implicitly, this scenario feature was cautioning against the 
assumption that short-term trends predicate particular long-term trajectories. This is also the case in relation 
to the COVID-19 related drop in 2020 emissions. Potential changes in underlying drivers of emissions, such 
as those potentially incentivised by COVID-19 recovery stimulus packages, are more significant for longer-
term emissions than the short-term deviation from recent emission trends (Cross-Chapter Box 6.1 on 
COVID-19 in Chapter 6). 


## 1.6.2  Global warming levels 
 
The global mean surface temperature change, or ‘global warming level’ (GWL), is a ‘dimension of 
integration’ that is highly relevant across scientific disciplines and socioeconomic actors. First, global 
warming levels relative to pre-industrial conditions are the quantity in which the 1.5°C and ‘well below 2°C’ 
Paris Agreement goals were formulated. Second, global mean temperature change has been found to be 
nearly-linearly related to a number of regional climate effects (Mitchell et al., 2000; Mitchell, 2003; Tebaldi 
and Arblaster, 2014; Seneviratne et al., 2016; Li et al., 2020; Seneviratne and Hauser, 2020). Even where 
non-linearities are found, some regional climate effects can be considered to be almost scenario-independent 
for a given level of warming (Cross-Chapter Box 11.1 in Chapter 11; Chapter 4, Sections 4.2.4 and 4.6.1; 
Chapter 8, Section 8.5.3; Chapter 10, Section 10.4.3.1). Finally, the evolution of aggregated impacts with 
warming levels has been widely used and embedded in the assessment of the ‘Reasons for Concern’ (RFC) 
in IPCC WGII (Smith et al., 2009; IPCC, 2014a). The RFC framework was further expanded in SR1.5 
(2018), SROCC (2019) and SRCCL (2019) by explicitly describing the differential impacts of half-degree 
warming steps (cf. King et al., 2017) (Section 1.4.4; Cross-Chapter Box 12.1 in Chapter 12).  
 
In this Report, the term ‘global warming level’ refers to the categorisation of global and regional climate 
change, associated impacts, emission and concentration scenarios by global mean surface temperature 
relative to 1850-1900, which is the period used as a proxy for pre-industrial levels (see Cross-Chapter Box 
11.1 in Chapter 11). By default, GWLs are expressed as global surface air temperature (GSAT; see Section 
1.4.1; Cross-Chapter Box 2.3 in Chapter 2).  
 
As the SR1.5 concluded, even half-degree global mean temperature steps carry robust differences in climate 
impacts (see SR1.5,IPCC, 2018; Schleussner et al., 2016a; Wartenburger et al., 2017; see also Chapter 11). 
This Report adopts half-degree warming levels which allows integration within and across the three WGs for 
climate projections, impacts, adaptation challenges and mitigation challenges. The core set of - GWLs 1.5, 
2.0, 3.0 and 4.0°C - are highlighted (Chapters 4, 8, 11, 12 and the Atlas). Given that much impact analysis is 
based on previous scenarios, i.e., RCPs or SRES, and climate change mitigation analysis is based on new 
emission scenarios in addition to the main SSP scenarios, these global warming levels assist in the 
comparison of climate states across scenarios and in the synthesis across the broader literature. 
 
The transient and equilibrium states of certain global warming levels can differ in their climate impacts 
(IPCC, 2018; King et al., 2020). Climate impacts in a ‘transient’ world relate to a scenario in which the 
world is continuing to warm. On the other hand, climate impacts at the same warming levels can also be 
estimated from equilibrium states after a (relatively) short-term stabilisation by the end of the 21st century or 
at a (near-) equilibrium state after a long-term (multi-decadal to multi-millennial) stabilisation. Different 
methods to estimate these climate states come with challenges and limitations (Chapter 4, Section 4.6.1; 
Cross-Chapter Box 11.1 in Chapter 11). First, information can be drawn from GCM or ESM simulations that 
‘pass through’ the respective warming levels (as used and demonstrated in the Interactive Atlas to this 
report), also called ‘epoch’ or ‘time-shift’ approaches (Chapter 4, Sections 4.2.4 and 4.6.1) (Herger et al., 
2015; James et al., 2017; Tebaldi and Knutti, 2018). Information from transient simulations can also be used 
through an empirical scaling relationship (Seneviratne et al., 2016, 2018; Wartenburger et al., 2017) or using 
‘time sampling’ approaches, as described in James et al. (2017). Second, information can be drawn from 
large ESM ensembles with prescribed SST at particular global warming levels (Mitchell et al., 2017), 
although an underrepresentation of variability can arise when using prescribed SST temperatures (Fischer et 
al., 2018a).  
 
In order to fully derive climate impacts, warming levels will need to be complemented by additional 
information, such as their associated CO2 concentrations (e.g., fertilization or ocean acidification), 
composition of the total radiative forcing (aerosols vs greenhouse gases, with varying regional distributions) 
or socioeconomic conditions (e.g., to estimate societal impacts). More fundamentally, while a global 
warming level is a good proxy for the state of the climate (Cross-Chapter Box 11.1 in Chapter 11), it does 
not uniquely define a change in global or regional climate state. For example, regional precipitation 
responses depend on the details of the individual forcing mechanisms that caused the change (Samset et al., 
2016), on whether the temperature level is stabilized or transient (King et al., 2020; Zappa et al., 2020), on 
the vertical structure of the troposphere (Andrews et al., 2010), and, in particular, on the global distribution 
of atmospheric aerosols (Frieler et al., 2012). Another aspect is how Earth system components with century 
to millennial response timescales, such as long-term sea level rise or permafrost thaw, are affected by global 
mean warming. For example, sea level rise 50 years after a 1°C warming will be lower than sea level rise 
150 years after that same 1°C warming (Chapter 9).  
 
Also, forcing or response patterns that vary in time can create differences in regional climates for the same 
global mean warming level, or can create non-linearities when scaling patterns from one warming level to 
another (King et al., 2018), depending on whether near-term transient climate, end of the century, 
equilibrium climate or climate states after an initial overshoot are considered.  
 
In spite of these challenges, and thanks to recent methodological advances in quantifying or overcoming 
them, global warming levels provide a robust and useful integration mechanism. They allow knowledge from 
various domains within WGI and across the three WGs to be integrated and communicated (Cross Chapter 
Box 11.1). In this report, Chapters 4, 8, 11, 12 and the Atlas provide information specific to certain warming 
levels, highlighting the regional differences, but also the approximate scalability of regional climate change, 
that can arise from even a 0.5°C shift in global-mean temperatures. Furthermore, building on WGI insights 
into physical climate system responses (Cross-Chapter Box 7.1 in Chapter 7), WGIII will use peak and end-
of-century global warming levels to classify a broad set of scenarios. 
 
 
## 1.6.3  Cumulative CO2 emissions 
 
The WGI AR5 (IPCC, 2013a) and the SR1.5 (IPCC, 2018) highlighted the near-linear relationship between 
cumulative carbon emissions and global mean warming (Section 1.3; Section 5.5). This implies that 
continued CO2 emissions will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system, 
independent of any specific scenario or pathway. This is captured in the TCRE concept, which relates CO2-
induced global mean warming to cumulative carbon emissions (Chapter 5). This Report thus uses cumulative 
CO2 emissions to compare the climate response across scenarios, and to categorise emission scenarios 
(Figure 1.29). The advantage of using cumulative CO2 emissions is that it is an inherent emission scenario 
characteristic rather than an outcome of the scenario-based projections, where uncertainties in the cause-
effect chain from emissions to atmospheric concentrations to temperature change are important.  
 
There is also a close relationship between cumulative total greenhouse gas emissions and cumulative CO2 
emissions for scenarios in the SR1.5 scenario database (IPCC, 2018; Figure 1.29). The dominance of CO2 
compared to other well-mixed greenhouse gases (Figure 1.29; Chapter 5, Section 5.2.4) allows policymakers 
to make use of the carbon budget concept (Chapter 5, Section 5.5) in a policy context, in which GWP-
weighted combinations of multiple greenhouse gases are used to define emission targets. A caveat is that 
cumulative GWP-weighted CO2 equivalent emissions over the next decades do not yield exactly the same 
temperature outcomes as the same amount of cumulative CO2 emissions, because atmospheric perturbation 
lifetimes of the various greenhouse gases differ. While carbon budgets are not derived using GWP-weighted 
emission baskets but rather by explicit modelling of non-CO2 induced warming (Chapter 5, Section 5.5; 
Cross-Chapter Box 7.1 in Chapter 7), the policy frameworks based on GWP-weighted emission baskets can 
still make use of the insights from remaining cumulative carbon emissions for different warming levels. 
  
The same cumulative CO2 emissions could lead to a slightly different level of warming over time (Box 1.4). 
Rapid emissions followed by steep cuts and potentially net-negative emissions would be characterised by a 
higher maximum warming and faster warming rate, compared with the same cumulative CO2 emissions 
spread over a longer period. As further explored in the WGIII assessment, one potential limitation when 
presenting emission pathway characteristics in cumulative emission budget categories is that path 
dependencies and lock-in effects (e.g. today’s decisions regarding fossil fuel related infrastructure) play an 
important role in long-term mitigation strategies (Davis et al., 2010; Luderer et al., 2018). Similarly, high 
emissions early on might imply strongly net negative emissions (Minx et al., 2018) later on to reach the same 
cumulative emission and temperature target envelope by the end of the century (Box 1.4). This report 
explores options to address some of those potential issues from a WGI perspective (see Chapter 5, Sections 
5.5.2 and 5.6.2).

# 1.7  Final remarks 
 
The assessment in this Report is based on a rapidly growing body of new evidence from the peer-reviewed 
literature. Recently, scientific climate change research has doubled in output every 5–6 years; the majority of 
publications deal with issues related to the physical climate system (Burkett et al., 2014; Haunschild et al., 
2016). The sheer volume of published, peer-reviewed literature on climate change presents a challenge to 
comprehensive, robust and transparent assessment. 
 
The enhanced focus on regional climate in WGI AR6 further expands the volume of literature relative to 
AR5, including non-English language publications sometimes presented as reports (‘grey’ literature), 
particularly on topics such as regional observing networks and climate services. These factors enhance the 
challenge of discovering, accessing and assessing the relevant literature. The international, multi-lingual 
author teams of the IPCC AR6, combined with the open expert review process, help to minimise these 
concerns, but they remain a challenge.  
 
Despite the key role of CMIP6 in this Report (Section 1.5), the number of studies evaluating its results and 
modelling systems remains relatively limited. At the time of publication, additional model results are still 
becoming available. This reflects the need for close temporal alignment of the CMIP cycle with the IPCC 
assessment process, and the growing complexity of coordinated international modelling efforts.  
 
Indigenous and local knowledge includes information about past and present climate states. However, 
assessing this knowledge, and integrating it with the scientific literature, remains a challenge to be met. This 
lack of assessment capability and integration leads to most WGI chapters still not including Indigenous and 
local knowledge in their assessment findings. 
 
Spatial and temporal gaps in both historical and current observing networks, and the limited extent of 
paleoclimatic archives, have always posed a challenge for IPCC assessments. A relative paucity of long-term 
observations is particularly evident in Antarctica and in the depths of the ocean. Knowledge of previous 
cryospheric and oceanic processes is therefore incomplete. Sparse instrumental temperature observations 
prior to the industrial revolution makes it difficult to uniquely characterize a ‘pre-industrial’ baseline, 
although this report extends the assessment of anthropogenic temperature change further back in time than 
previous assessment cycles (Cross-Chapter Box 1.2, Chapter 7).  
 
Common, integrating scenarios can never encompass all possible events that might induce radiative forcing 
in the future (Section 1.4). These may include large volcanic eruptions (see Cross-Chapter Box 4.1 in 
Chapter 4), the consequences of a major meteorite, smoke plumes following a conflict involving nuclear 
weapons, extensive geo-engineering, or a major pandemic (Cross-Chapter Box 1.6). Scenario-related 
research also often focuses on the 21st century. Post-2100 climate changes are not covered as 
comprehensively, and their assessment is limited. Those long-term climate changes, potentially induced by 
forcing over the 21st century (as in the case of sea level rise), are nevertheless relevant for decision making. 
 
At the time of publication, the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on emissions, atmospheric 
abundances, radiative forcing and the climate (see Cross-Chapter Box 6.1 in Chapter 6), and on observations 
(Section 1.5.1), are not yet fully evident. Their assessment in this report is thus limited.
