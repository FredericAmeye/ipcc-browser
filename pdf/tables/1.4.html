			<td>The shared socioeconomic pathway family, i.e., the socioeconomic developments with 
			storylines regarding (among other things) GDP, population, urbanisation, economic 
			collaboration, human and technological development projections that describe different 
			future worlds in the absence of climate change and additional climate policy (O&rsquo;Neill et 
			al., 2014). The quantification of energy, land use and emission implications in those 
			storylines is not part of the SSPX narratives, but follows in a second step in which their 
			climate outcomes are defined. This second step is dependent upon the IAM that is used 
			for this quantification (Riahi et al., 2017) (see SSPX-Y)&nbsp;</td>

			<td>&lsquo;<strong>RCPY</strong>&rsquo; with Y&nbsp;standing for 
			approximate 
			radiative forcing 
			level in 2100, at 
			levels 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 
			or 8.5. &nbsp;</td>
			<td>Representative Concentration Pathways (Moss et al., 2010; van Vuuren et al., 2011). 
			These are GHG concentrations (Meinshausen et al., 2011b) , aerosol emissions 
			(Lamarque et al., 2011) and land use pattern time series (Hurtt et al., 2011) derived from 
			several IAMs. The pathways were originally generated from specific sets of socio-<br />
			economic drivers, but these are no longer considered. Instead, these RCP emission and 
			concentration time series are used in combination with a range of socio-economic futures 
			(see SSPX-RCPY). For example, the CMIP5 intercomparison (assessed in IPCC AR5) 
			developed climate futures based on these emission and concentration pathways from the 
			RCPs. &nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

			<td>The SSP and RCP 
			combination  
			&lsquo;<strong>SSPX-RCPY</strong>&rsquo; 
			with X and Y as 
			above. &nbsp;</td>
			<td>Combination of the SSP socioeconomic pathway X with climate futures stemming from 
			GCMs, AOGCMs or Earth system model runs that used the RCPY. This combination is 
			widely used in the impact literature assessed by WGII (see for example the Special Issue 
			on SSPs by van Vuuren et al. (2014) and the large literature collection in the 
			International Committee On New Integrated Climate change assessment Scenarios 
			database (ICONICS, 2021). These SSPX-RCPY scenarios differ from the SSPX-Y group 
			(below) in that the respective socio-economic futures (SSPXs) and emission and 
			concentration futures (RCPYs) were developed separately before being used in 
			combination. &nbsp;</td>

		<tr>
			<td>&lsquo;<strong>SSPX-Y</strong>&rsquo; with X 
			and Y as above. &nbsp;</td>
			<td>SSPX-Y is the abbreviation for a scenario, where X is the numbering of the SSP 
			socioeconomic family (1 to 5) that was used to develop the emission pathway, and the Y 
			indicates the approximate radiative forcing value reached by the end of the century. The 
			SSPX-Y scenarios span the nominal range from 1.9 to 8.5 W m2. A range of different 
			IAMs were used to quantify the SSPX-Y scenarios, but each IAM quantified both the 
			scenario-economic futures (energy use, land use, population etc) and various emission 
			futures within the same IAM modelling framework, thus enhancing the consistency 
			between the socio-economic backgrounds and their resulting emission futures. In 
			contrast, the SSPX-RCPY framework combines the SSP socio-economic futures and 
			RCP emission and concentration futures at random (see above). For more details, see 
			Section 1.6.1.1.&nbsp;</td>
