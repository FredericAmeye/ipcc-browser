<p>*(1) Human-induced global surface temperature increase between 1850-1900 and 2010-2019 is assessed at 0.8-1.3&deg;C (likely range; Cross-Section Box TS.1) with a best estimate of 1.07&deg;C. Combined with a central estimate of TCRE (1.65&deg;C egC<sup>-1</sup>) this uncertainty in isolation results in a potential variation of remaining carbon budgets of &plusmn;550GtCO2, which, however, is not dependent of the assessed uncertainty of TCRE and thus not fully additional.<br />
*(2) TCRE: transient climate response to cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide, assessed to fall likely between 1.0-2.3&deg;C EgC<sup>-1</sup> with a normal distribution, from which the percentiles are taken. Additional Earth system feedbacks are included in the remaining carbon budget estimates as discussed in Section 5.5.2.2.5.<br />
*(3) Estimates assume that non-CO2 emissions are mitigated consistent with the median reductions found in scenarios in the literature as assessed in SR1.5. Non-CO2 scenario variations indicate how much remaining carbon budget estimates vary due to different scenario assumptions related to the future evolution of non-CO2 emissions in mitigation scenarios from SR1.5 that reach net zero CO2 emissions. This variation is additional to the uncertainty in TCRE. The WGIII Contribution to AR6 will reassess the potential for non-CO2 mitigation based on literature since the SR1.5.<br />
*(4) Geophysical uncertainties reported in these columns and TCRE uncertainty are not statistically independent, as uncertainty in TCRE depents on uncertainty in the assessment of historical temperature, non-CO2 versus CO2 forcing and uncertainty in emissions estimates. These estimates cannot be formally combined and these uncertainty variations are not directly additional to the spread of remaining carbon budgets due to TCRE uncertainty reported in columns 3 to 7.<br />
*(5) Recent emissions uncertainty reflects the &plusmn;10% uncertainty in the historical CO2 emissions estimate since 1 January 2015.</p>
