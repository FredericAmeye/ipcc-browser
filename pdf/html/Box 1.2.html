<p>The Sixth Assessment Cycle started with three Special Reports. The Special Report on Global Warming of 
1.5°C (SR1.5, (IPCC, 2018), invited by the Parties to the UNFCCC in the context of the Paris Agreement, 
assessed current knowledge on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and 
related global greenhouse gas (GHG) emission pathways. The Special Report on Climate Change and Land 
(SRCCL, IPCC, 2019a) addressed GHG fluxes in land-based ecosystems, land use and sustainable land 
management in relation to climate change adaptation and mitigation, desertification, land degradation and 
food security. The Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC, IPCC, 
2019b) assessed new literature on observed and projected changes of the ocean and the cryosphere, and their 
associated impacts, risks, and responses. </p>

<p>The SR1.5 and SRCCL were produced through a collaboration between the three IPCC Working Groups, the 
SROCC by only WGs I and II. Here we focus on key findings relevant to the physical science basis covered 
by WGI.  </p>

<h2>1)  Observations of climate change</h2>

<p>The SR1.5 estimated with high confidence that human activities caused a global warming of approximately 
1°C between the 1850-1900 and 2017. For the period 2006–2015, observed global mean surface temperature 
(GMST7) was 0.87±0.12°C higher than the average over the 1850–1900 period (very high confidence). 
Anthropogenic global warming was estimated to be increasing at 0.2±0.1°C per decade (high confidence) 
and likely matches the level of observed warming to within ±20%. The SRCCL found with high confidence 
that over land, mean surface air temperature increased by 1.53±0.15°C from 1850–1900 to 2006–2015, or 
nearly twice as much as the global average. This observed warming has already led to increases in the 
frequency and intensity of climate and weather extremes in many regions and seasons, including heat waves 
in most land regions (high confidence), increased droughts in some regions (medium confidence), and 
increases in the intensity of heavy precipitation events at the global scale (medium confidence). These 
climate changes have contributed to desertification and land degradation in many regions (high confidence). 
Increased urbanisation can enhance warming in cities and their surroundings (heat island effect), especially 
during heat waves (high confidence), and intensify extreme rainfall (medium confidence). </p>

<p>With respect to the ocean, the SROCC assessed that it is virtually certain that the ocean has warmed 
unabated since 1970 and has taken up more than 90% of the excess heat contributed by global warming. The 
rate of ocean warming has likely more than doubled since 1993. Over the period 1982–2016, marine 
heatwaves have very likely doubled in frequency and are increasing in intensity (very high confidence). In 
addition, the surface ocean acidified further (virtually certain) and loss of oxygen occurred from the surface 
to a depth of 1000 m (medium confidence). The report expressed medium confidence that the Atlantic 
Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) weakened in 2004–2017 relative to 1850–1900. </p>

<p>Concerning the cryosphere, the SROCC reported widespread continued shrinking of nearly all components. 
Mass loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet tripled over the period 2007–2016 relative to 1997–2006, while mass 
loss doubled for the Greenland Ice Sheet (likely, medium confidence). The report concludes with very high 
confidence that due to the combined increased loss from the ice sheets, global mean sea level (GMSL) rise 
has accelerated (extremely likely). The rate of recent GMSL rise (3.6±0.5 mm yr-1 for 2006–2015) is about 
2.5 times larger than for 1901–1990. The report also found that Arctic sea ice extent has very likely 
decreased for all months of the year since 1979 and that September sea ice reductions of 12.8±2.3% per 
decade are likely unprecedented for at least 1000 years. Feedbacks from the loss of summer sea ice and 
spring snow cover on land have contributed to amplified warming in the Arctic (high confidence), where 
surface air temperature likely increased by more than double the global average over the last two decades. By 
contrast, Antarctic sea ice extent overall saw no statistically significant trend for the period 1979 to 2018 
(high confidence). </p>

<p>The SROCC assessed that anthropogenic climate change has increased observed precipitation (medium 
confidence), winds (low confidence), and extreme sea level events (high confidence) associated with some 
tropical cyclones. It also found evidence for an increase in annual global proportion of Category 4 or 5 
tropical cyclones in recent decades (low confidence). </p>

<h2>2)     Drivers of climate change</h2>

<p>The SRCCL stated that the land is simultaneously a source and sink of CO2 due to both anthropogenic and 
natural drivers. It estimates with medium confidence that Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use 
(AFOLU) activities accounted for around 13% of CO2, 44% of methane, and 82% of nitrous oxide emissions 
from human activities during 2007–2016, representing 23% (12.0±3.0 GtCO2 equivalent yr-1) of the total net 
anthropogenic emissions of GHGs. The natural response of land to human-induced environmental change 
such as increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, nitrogen deposition, and climate change, caused a net 
CO2 sink equivalent of around 29% of total CO2 emissions (medium confidence); however, the persistence of 
the sink is uncertain due to climate change (high confidence). </p>

<p>The SRCCL also assessed how changes in land conditions affect global and regional climate. It found that 
changes in land cover have led to both a net release of CO2, contributing to global warming, and an increase 
in global land albedo, causing surface cooling. However, the report estimated that the resulting net effect on 
globally averaged surface temperature was small over the historical period (medium confidence). </p>

<p>The SROCC found that the carbon content of Arctic and boreal permafrost is almost twice that of the 
atmosphere (medium confidence), and assessed medium evidence with low agreement that thawing northern 
permafrost regions are currently releasing additional net methane and CO2. </p>

<h2>3)     Projections of climate change</h2>

<p>The SR1.5 concluded that global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to 
increase at the current rate (high confidence). However, even though warming from anthropogenic emissions 
will persist for centuries to millennia and will cause ongoing long-term changes, past emissions alone are 
unlikely to raise global surface temperatur to 1.5°C above 1850-1900 levels.  </p>

<p>The SR1.5 also found that reaching and sustaining net zero anthropogenic CO2 emissions and reducing net 
non-CO2 radiative forcing would halt anthropogenic global warming on multi-decadal time scales (high 
confidence). The maximum temperature reached is then determined by cumulative net global anthropogenic 
CO2 emissions up to the time of net zero CO2 emissions (high confidence) and the level of non-CO2 radiative 
forcing in the decades prior to the time that maximum temperatures are reached (medium confidence). </p>

<p>Furthermore, climate models project robust differences in regional climate characteristics between the 
present day and a global warming of 1.5°C, and between 1.5°C and 2°C, including mean temperature in most 
land and ocean regions and hot extremes in most inhabited regions (high confidence). There is medium 
confidence in robust differences in heavy precipitation events in several regions and the probability of 
droughts in some regions. </p>

<p>The SROCC projected that global-scale glacier mass loss, permafrost thaw, and decline in snow cover and 
Arctic sea ice extent will continue in the near term (2031–2050) due to surface air temperature increases 
(high confidence). The Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets are projected to lose mass at an increasing rate 
throughout the 21st century and beyond (high confidence). Sea level rise will also continue at an increasing 
rate. For the period 2081–2100 with respect to 1986–2005, the likely ranges of global mean sea level 
(GMSL) rise are projected at 0.26–0.53 m for RCP2.6 and 0.51–0.92 m for RCP8.5. For the RCP8.5 
scenario, projections of GMSL rise by 2100 are higher by 0.1 m than in AR5 due to a larger contribution 
from the Antarctic Ice Sheet (medium confidence). Extreme sea level events that occurred once per hundred 
years in the recent past are projected to occur at least once per year at many locations by 2050, especially in 
tropical regions, under all RCP scenarios (high confidence). According to SR1.5, by 2100, GMSL rise would 
be around 0.1 m lower with 1.5°C global warming compared to 2°C (medium confidence). If warming is held 
to 1.5°, GMSLwill still continue to rise well beyond 2100, but at a slower rate and a lower magnitude. 
However, instability and/or irreversible loss of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets, resulting in multi-
metre rise in sea level over hundreds to thousands of years, could be triggered at 1.5°C to 2°C of global 
warming (medium confidence). According to the SROCC, sea level rise in an extended RCP2.6 scenario 
would be limited to around 1 m in 2300 (low confidence) while multi-metre sea-level rise is projected under 
RCP8.5 by then (medium confidence). </p>

<p>The SROCC projected that over the 21st century, the ocean will transition to unprecedented conditions with 
increased temperatures (virtually certain), further acidification (virtually certain), and oxygen decline 
(medium confidence). Marine heatwaves are projected to become more frequent (very high confidence) as are 
extreme El Niño and La Niña events (medium confidence). The AMOC is projected to weaken during the 
21st century (very likely), but a collapse is deemed very unlikely (albeit with medium confidence due to 
known biases in the climate models used for the assessment). </p>

<h2>4)     Emission pathways to limit global warming</h2>

<p>The SR1.5 focused on emission pathways and system transitions consistent with 1.5°C global warming over 
the 21st century. Building upon the understanding from WGI AR5 of the quasi-linear relationship between 
cumulative net anthropogenic CO2 emissions since 1850–1900 and maximum global mean temperature, the 
report assessed the remaining carbon budgets compatible with the 1.5°C or 2°C warming goals of the Paris 
Agreement. Starting from year 2018, the remaining carbon budget for a one-in-two chance of limiting global 
warming to 1.5°C is about 580 GtCO2, and about 420 GtCO2 for a two-in-three chance (medium confidence). 
At constant 2017 emissions, these budgets would be depleted by about the years 2032 and 2028, 
respectively. Using GMST instead of GSAT gives estimates of 770 and 570 GtCO2, respectively (medium 
confidence). Each budget is further reduced by approximately 100 GtCO2 over the course of this century 
when permafrost and other less well represented Earth-system feedbacks are taken into account.  </p>

<p>It is concluded that all emission pathways with no or limited overshoot of 1.5°C imply that global net 
anthropogenic CO2 emissions would need to decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching net 
zero around 2050, together with deep reductions in other anthropogenic emissions, such as methane and 
black carbon. To limit global warming to below 2°C, CO2 emissions would have to decline by about 25% by 
2030 and reach net zero around 2070.  </p>
