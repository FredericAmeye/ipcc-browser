<p>Chapters 2, 3 and 4 assess the current evidence basis for climatic changes, their causes, and their potential 
future under different possible emissions pathways using a combination of observations and state-of-the-art 
Earth System Models (ESMs). The assessment in these chapters focuses on selected large-scale indicators 
and modes as defined in this Box. These indicators and modes of variability taken together characterise 
overall changes to the climate system as a whole.  </p>

<h3>Defining large-scale</h3>

<p>Understanding of large-scale climate variability and change requires knowledge of both the response to 
forcings and the role of internal variability. Many forcings have substantial hemispheric or continental scale 
variations. Modes of climate variability are generally driven by ocean basin scale processes. The climate 
system involves process interactions from the micro- to the global-scale and as such, any threshold for 
defining "large-scale" is arbitrary, but, within these chapters on the basis of these considerations large-scale 
is defined to include ocean basin and continental scales as well as hemispheric and global scales.  </p>

<h3>Defining a key set of climate indicators</h3>

<p>Key climate indicators should constitute a finite set of distinct variables and / or metrics that may 
collectively point to important overall changes in the climate system that provide a synthesis of climate 
system evolution and are of broad societal relevance. Key indicators have been selected across the 
atmospheric, oceanic, cryospheric and biospheric domains, with land as a cross-cutting component. These 
indicators, and their use across chapters 2 to 4, as well as the broader report, are summarized in Cross-
Chapter Box 2.2 Table 1. All selected indicators are Essential Climate Variables as defined by the Global 
Climate Observing System (Bojinski et al., 2014). </p>

<h3>Atmospheric indicators</h3>

<p>Monitoring surface temperatures is integral to the negotiations of UNFCCC and the global mean temperature 
goals of the Paris Agreement. Upper-air temperatures are a key indicator of different causal mechanisms 
underlying climate change and underpinned the very first conclusion in the Second Assessment Report of a 
‘discernible human influence’ (Santer et al., 1996). To ascertain large-scale changes of and human influence 
on the global hydrological cycle (which includes terrestrial and oceanic components), a small subset of 
indicators across this cycle are chosen: ocean and land precipitaion-evaproation (P-E), global precipitation, 
total column water vapour, surface humidity (specific and relative), and global river runoff. Chapter 8 
performs a substantive and holistic assessment of a much broader range of components. Finally, a warming 
world may be accompanied by a change in large-scale circulation patterns linked through energy / mass / 
momentum constraints such as the extent and strength of the Hadley circulation (HC), monsoon systems, and 
/ or the position and strength of the sub-tropical and polar jets.  </p>

<h3>Cryospheric indicators</h3>

<p>Changes in ice sheets are indicators of the longest-term impacts of climate change and associated with 
changes in global and regional sea level. Seasonal snow cover has many implications for mid- to high-
latitude regions (albedo, hydrological cycle, etc.) with impacts on biospheric components of the system. 
Changes in sea ice extent, seasonality and thickness have potential impacts for hemispheric-scale circulation 
(Cross-Chapter Box 10.1). Changes in glacier mass balance contribute to changes in sea level but also have 
substantial implications for water supply for a substantial proportion of the global population. Finally, 
changes in permafrost and the seasonally thawed active layer have substantial implications in mid- to high-
latitudes and have been hypothesised to be important in potential feedbacks through degassing of WMGHGs 
as the permafrost thaws. </p>

<h3>Oceanic indicators</h3>

<p>Most of the energy imbalance (Box 7.2) in the climate system is taken up by the ocean, resulting in changes 
in ocean temperature and heat content. Salinity changes indicate broad-scale hydrological cycle and 
circulation changes. Global-mean sea-level change is a key indicator of the impacts of both global warming 
and changes in global ice volume. Furthermore, it is integral to assessing the global energy budget (Cross-
Chapter Box 9.1). The oceanic overturning circulation redistributes heat, carbon, oxygen and salinity within 
the ocean. Declines in ocean pH result from air-sea exchange of carbon dioxide and loss of ocean oxygen 
results from ocean warming; both lead to changes in marine ecosystems. </p>

<h3>Biospheric indicators</h3>

<p>The seasonal cycle of CO2 is an integrated measure of the biogeochemical activity across the global 
biosphere. Changes in marine and terrestrial ecosystems can also be observed directly at large scales. For 
small, free-floating organisms such as phytoplankton, the dynamics can be rapid in nature, whereas on land 
slower changes in plant assemblages may occur, with commensurate changes in altitude and latitude of the 
tree-line. Lengthening of the growing season and the associated changes in phenology, distribution and 
abundance of species would be expected in most of the extratropics. Biospheric indicators and their impacts are assessed in much greater detail in WGII Chapters 2 and 3. </p>

<h3>Defining a selection of modes of variability</h3>

<p>Many modes of climate variability affect global, hemispheric or regional climate across a range of 
timescales. Conversely, their behaviour may be influenced by global climate change. Modes were selected 
for inclusion that: i) have effects at large spatial scales; and ii) have substantial potential to modify 
interannual to multidecadal climate. The selected modes are considered in multiple chapters (Cross-Chapter 
Box 2.2 Table 2) and are defined in Annex IV. </p>
