<p>Over the long evolution of the Earth’s climate system, several periods have been extensively studied as 
examples of distinct climate states. This Cross-Chapter Box places multiple paleoclimate reference periods 
into the unifying context of Earth’s long-term climate history, and points to sections in the report with 
additional information about each period. Other reference periods, including those of the industrialized era, 
are described in Section 1.4.1. </p>

<p>The reference periods represent times that were both colder and warmer than present, and periods of rapid 
climate change, many with informative parallels to projected climate (Cross-Chapter Box 2.1, Table 1). They 
are used to address a wide variety of questions related to natural climate variations in the past (FAQ 1.3). 
Most of them are used as targets to evaluate the performance of climate models under different climate 
forcings (Section 3.8.2), while also providing insight into the ocean-atmospheric circulation changes 
associated with various radiative forcings and geographical changes.  </p>

<p>Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST) is a key indicator of the changing state of the climate system. 
Earth’s mean temperature history during the current geological era (Cenozoic, beginning 66 Ma) can be 
broadly characterized as follows (Cross-Chapter Box 2.1, Figure 1): (1) transient warming during the first 15 
million years of the Cenozoic, punctuated by the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum; (2) a long-term 
cooling over tens of millions of years beginning around 50 Ma, driven by (among other factors) the slow 
drift of tectonic plates, which drove mountain building, erosion and volcanism, and reconfigured ocean 
passages, all of which ultimately moved carbon from the atmosphere to other reservoirs and led to the 
development of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) about 35–30 Ma; (2) the intensification of cooling by climate 
feedbacks involving interactions among tectonics, ice albedo, ocean circulation, land cover and greenhouse 
gases, causing ice sheets to develop in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) by about 3 Ma; (3) glacial-interglacial 
fluctuations paced by slow changes in Earth’s astronomical configuration (orbital forcing) and modulated by 
changes in the global carbon cycle and ice sheets on time scales of tens to hundreds of thousands of years, 
with particular prominence during the last 1 Myr; (4) a transition with both gradual and abrupt shifts from 
the Last Glacial Maximum to the present interglacial epoch (Holocene), with sporadic ice-sheet breakup 
disrupting ocean circulation; (5) continued warming followed by minor cooling following the mid-Holocene, 
with superposed centennial- to decadal-scale fluctuations caused by volcanic activity, among other factors; 
(6) recent warming related to the build-up of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (Sections 2.2.3, 3.3.1). </p>

<p>GMST estimated for each of the reference periods based on proxy evidence (Section 2.3.1.1) can be 
compared with climate projections over coming centuries to place the range of possible futures into a longer-
term context (Cross-Chapter Box 2.1, Figure 1). Here, the very likely range of GMST for the warmer world 
reference periods are compared with the very likely range of GSAT projected for the end the 21st century 
(2080–2100; Table 4.5 and the likely range for the end of the 23rd century (2300; Table 4.9) under multiple 
Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios. From this comparison, there is medium confidence in the 
following: GMST estimated for the warmest long-term period of the Last Interglacial about 125 ka (0.5–
1.5°C relative to 1850–1900) overlaps with the low end of the range of temperatures projected under SSP1-
2.6 including its negative emissions extension to the end of the 23rd century [1.0 to 2.2°C]. GMST estimated 
for a period of prolonged warmth during the mid-Pliocene Warm Period about 3 Ma [2.5 to 4.0°C] is similar 
to temperatures projected under SSP2-4.5 for the end of the 23rd century [2.3 to 4.6°C]. GMST estimated for 
the Miocene Climatic Optimum [5°C to 10°C] and Early Eocene Climatic Optimum [10 to 18°C], about 15 
and 50 million years ago, respectively, overlap with the range projected for the end of the 23rd century under 
SSP5-8.5 [6.6 to 14.1°C]. </p>
