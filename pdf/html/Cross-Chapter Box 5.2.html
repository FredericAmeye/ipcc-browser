<p>The atmospheric methane (CH4) growth rate has varied widely over the past three decades, and the causes of 
which have been extensively studied since AR5. The mean growth rate decreased from 15 ± 5 ppb yr-1 in the 
1980s to 0.48 ± 3.2 ppb yr-1 during 2000–2006 (the so-called quasi-equilibrium phase) and returned to an 
average rate of 7.6 ± 2.7 ppb yr-1 in the past decade (2010–2019) (based on data in Figure 5.14). 
Atmospheric CH4 grew faster (9.3 ± 2.4 ppb yr-1) over the last six years (2014–2019) – a period with 
prolonged El Niño conditions, which contributed to high CH4 growth rates consistent with behaviour during 
previous El Niño events (Figure 5.14b). Because of large uncertainties in both the emissions and sinks of 
CH4, it has been challenging to quantify accurately the methane budget and ascribe reasons for the growth 
over 1980-2019. In the context of CH4 emissions mitigation, it is critical to understand if the changes in 
growth rates are caused by emissions from human activities or by natural processes responding to changing 
climate. If CH4 continues to grow at rates similar to those observed over the past decade, it will contribute to 
decadal scale climate change and hinder the achievement of the long-term temperature goals of the Paris 
Agreement (Nisbet et al., 2019)(7.3.2.2).  </p>

<p>Cross-Chapter Box 5.2 Figure 1 shows the decadal CH4 budget derived from the Global Carbon Project 
(GCP)-CH4 synthesis for 1980s, 1990s and 2000s (Kirschke et al., 2013), and for 2010–2017 (Saunois et al., 
2020). The imbalance of the sources and sinks estimated by atmospheric inversions (red bars) can be used to 
explain the changes in CH4 concentration increase rates between the decades (Table 5.2).  </p>

<p>Since AR5, many studies have discussed the role of different source categories in explaining the increase in 
CH4 growth rate since 2007 and a coincident decrease of δ13C–CH4 and δD–CH4 isotopes (ref. Figure 5.13; 
Rice et al., 2016). Both 13C and D are enriched in mass-weighted average source signatures for CH4 
emissions from thermogenic sources (e.g. coal mining, oil and gas industry) and pyrogenic (biomass 
burning) sources, and depleted in biogenic (e.g. wetlands, rice paddies, enteric fermentation, landfill and 
waste) sources. Proposed hypotheses for CH4 growth (2007–2017) are inconclusive and vary from a 
concurrent decrease in thermogenic and increase in wetland and other biogenic emissions (Nisbet et al., 
2016; Schwietzke et al., 2016), increase in from emissions agriculture in the tropics (Schaefer et al., 2016), a 
concurrent reduction in pyrogenic and increase in thermogenic emissions (Worden et al., 2017), or emission 
increase from biogenic sources and a slower increase in emissions from thermogenic sources compared to 
inventory emissions (Patra et al., 2016; Thompson et al., 2018; Jackson et al., 2020; Chandra et al., 2021).  </p>

<p>A few studies have emphasised the role of chemical destruction by OH, the primary sink of methane, in 
driving changes in the growth of atmospheric methane abundance, in particular after 2006 (Rigby et al., 
2017; Turner et al., 2017). Studies applying three-dimensional atmospheric inversion (McNorton et al., 
2018), simple multi-species inversion (Thompson et al., 2018), as well as empirical method using a variety 
of observational constraints based on OH chemistry (Nicely et al., 2018; Patra et al., 2021), do not find 
trends in OH large enough to explain the methane changes post-2006. On the contrary, global chemistry-
climate models based on fundamental principles of atmospheric chemistry and known emission trends of 
anthropogenic non-methane SLCFs simulate an increase in OH over this period (Zhao et al., 2019; 
Stevenson et al., 2020) (see Section 6.2.3). These contrasting lines of evidence suggest that OH changes may 
have had a small moderating influence on methane growth since 2007 (low confidence).       </p>

<p>Cross-Chapter Box 5.2 Figure 2 shows that modelled wetland emission anomalies for all regions did not 
exhibit statistically significant trends (high agreement between models, medium evidence). Thus, the inter-
decadal difference of total CH4 emissions derived from inversion models and wetland emissions, arises 
mainly from anthropogenic activities. The timeseries of regional emissions suggest that progress towards 
atmospheric CH4 quasi-equilibrium was primarily driven by reductions in anthropogenic (fossil fuel 
exploitation) emissions in Europe, Russia and temperate North America over 1988–2000. In the global 
totals, emissions equalled loss in the early 2000s. The growth since 2007 is driven by increasing agricultural 
emissions from East Asia (1997–2017), West Asia (2005–2017), Brazil (1988–2017) and Northern Africa 
(2005–2017), and fossil fuel exploitations in temperate North America (2010–2017) (Lan et al., 2019; Crippa 
et al., 2020; Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2020; Jackson et al., 2020; Chandra et al., 2021).  </p>

<p>Evidence from emission inventories at country level and regional scale inverse modelling that CH4 growth 
rate variability during the 1988 through 2017 is closely linked to anthropogenic activities (medium 
agreement). Isotopic composition observations and inventory data suggest that concurrent emission changes 
from both fossil fuels and agriculture are playing roles in the resumed CH4 growth since 2007 (high 
confidence). Shorter-term decadal variability is predominantly driven by the influence of El Niño Southern 
Oscillation on emissions from wetlands and biomass burning (Cross-Chapter Box 5.2 Figure 2), and loss due 
to OH variations (medium confidence), but lacking quantitative contribution from each of the sectors. By 
synthesising all available information regionally from a-priori (bottom-up) emissions, satellite and surface 
observations, including isotopic information, and inverse modelling (top-down), the capacity to track and 
explain changes in and drivers of natural and anthropogenic CH4 regional and global emissions has been 
improved since the AR5, but fundamental uncertainties related to OH variations remain unchanged. </p>
