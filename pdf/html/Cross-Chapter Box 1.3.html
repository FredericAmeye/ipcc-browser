<p>The IPCC SREX presented a framework for assessing risks from climate change, linking hazards (due to 
changes in climate) with exposure and vulnerability (Cardona et al., 2012). This framework was further 
developed by AR5 WGII (IPCC, 2014b), while AR5 WGI focussed only on the hazard component of risk. 
As part of AR6, a cross-Working Group process expanded and refined the concept of risk to allow for a 
consistent risk framing to be used across the three IPCC working groups (IPCC, 2019b; Box 2 in Abram et 
al., 2019; Reisinger et al., 2020). </p>

<p>In this revised definition, risk is the ‘potential for adverse consequences for human or ecological systems, 
recognising the diversity of values and objectives associated with such systems. In the context of climate 
change, risks can arise not only from <em>impacts of climate change</em>, but also from potential human <em>responses 
to climate change</em>. Relevant adverse consequences include those on lives, livelihoods, health and wellbeing, 
economic, social and cultural assets and investments, infrastructure, services (including ecosystem services), 
ecosystems and species. </p>

<p>In the context of climate change impacts, risks result from dynamic interactions between climate-related 
hazards with the exposure and vulnerability of the affected human or ecological system to hazards. Hazards, 
exposure and vulnerability may each be subject to uncertainty in terms of magnitude and likelihood of 
occurrence, and each may change over time and space due to socio-economic changes and human decision-
making. </p>

<p>In the context of climate change responses, risks result from the potential for such responses not achieving 
the intended objective(s), or from potential trade-offs with, or negative side-effects on, other societal 
objectives, such as the Sustainable Development Goals. Risks can arise for example from uncertainty in 
implementation, effectiveness or outcomes of climate policy, climate-related investments, technology 
development or adoption, and system transitions’. </p>

<p>The following concepts are also relevant for the definition of risk (see Annex VII: Glossary): </p>

<p><em>Exposure:</em> The presence of people, livelihoods, species or ecosystems, environmental functions, services, 
and resources, infrastructure, or economic, social, or cultural assets in places and settings that could be 
adversely affected. </p>

<p><em>Vulnerability:</em> The propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected. Vulnerability encompasses a 
variety of concepts and elements including sensitivity or susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope 
and adapt. </p>

<p><em>Hazard:</em> The potential occurrence of a natural or human-induced physical event or trend that may cause loss 
of life, injury, or other health impacts, as well as damage and loss to property, infrastructure, livelihoods, 
service provision, ecosystems and environmental resources. </p>

<p><em>Impacts:</em> The consequences of realised risks on natural and human systems, where risks result from the 
interactions of climate-related hazards (including extreme weather and climate events), exposure, and 
vulnerability. Impacts generally refer to effects on lives, livelihoods, health and wellbeing, ecosystems and 
species, economic, social and cultural assets, services (including ecosystem services), and infrastructure. 
Impacts may be referred to as consequences or outcomes, and can be adverse or beneficial. </p>

<h3>Risk in AR6 WGI</h3>

<p>The revised risk framing clarifies the role and contribution of WGI to risk assessment. Risk in IPCC 
terminology applies only to human or ecological systems, not to physical systems on their own.  </p>

<p><em>Climatic impact-drivers:</em> CIDs are physical climate system conditions (e.g., means, extremes, events) that 
affect an element of society or ecosystems. Depending on system tolerance, CIDs and their changes can be 
detrimental, beneficial, neutral, or a mixture of each across interacting system elements and regions. </p>

<p>In AR6, WGI uses the term ‘climatic impact-drivers’ (CIDs) to describe changes in physical systems rather 
than ‘hazards’, because the term hazard already assumes an adverse consequence. The terminology of 
‘climatic impact-driver’ therefore allows WGI to provide a more value-neutral characterisation of climatic 
changes that may be relevant for understanding potential impacts, without pre-judging whether specific 
climatic changes necessarily lead to adverse consequences, as some could also result in beneficial outcomes 
depending on the specific system and associated values. Chapter 12 and the Atlas assess and provide 
information on climatic impact-drivers for different regions and sectors to support and link to WGII 
assessment of the impacts and risks (or opportunities) related to the changes in the climatic impact-drivers. 
Although CIDs can lead to adverse or beneficial outcomes, focus is given to CIDs connected to hazards, and 
hence inform risk. </p>

<p>‘Extremes’ are a category of CID, corresponding to unusual events with respect to the range of observed 
values of the variable. Chapter 11 assesses changes in weather and climate extremes, their attribution and 
future projections.  </p>

<p>As examples of the use of this terminology, the term ‘flood risk’ should not be used if it only describes 
changes in the frequency and intensity of flood events (a hazard); the risk from flooding to human and 
ecological systems is caused by the flood hazard, the exposure of the system affected (e.g., topography, 
human settlements or infrastructure in the area potentially affected by flooding) and the vulnerability of the 
system (e.g., design and maintenance of infrastructure, existence of early warning systems). As another 
example, climate-related risk to food security can arise from both potential climate change impacts and 
responses to climate change and can be exacerbated by other stressors. Drivers for risks related to climate 
change impacts include climate hazards (e.g., drought, temperature extremes, humidity), mediated by other 
climatic impact-drivers (e.g., increased CO2 fertilisation of certain types of crops may help increase yields), 
the potential for indirect climate-related impacts (e.g., pest outbreaks triggered by ecosystem responses to 
weather patterns), exposure of people (e.g., how many people depend on a particular crop) and vulnerability 
or adaptability (how able are affected people to substitute other sources of food, which may be related to 
financial access and markets).  </p>

<p>Information provided by WGI may or may not be relevant to understand risks related to climate change 
responses. For example, the risk to a company arising from emissions pricing, or the societal risk from 
reliance on an unproven mitigation technology, are not directly dependent on actual or projected changes in 
climate but arise largely from human choices. However, WGI climate information may be relevant to 
understand the potential for maladaptation, such as the potential for specific adaptation responses not 
achieving the desired outcome or having negative side-effects. For example, WGI information about the 
range of sea level rise can help inform understanding of whether coastal protection, accommodation, or 
retreat would be the most effective risk management strategy in a particular context.  </p>

<p>From a WGI perspective also relevant for risk assessment are low-likelihood high impact events and the 
concept of deep uncertainty. </p>

<p><em>Low-likelihood, high-impact events:</em> (LLHI) ‘These are events whose probability of occurrence is low but 
whose potential impacts on society and ecosystems are high. To better inform risk assessment and decision 
making, such low likelihood outcomes are described as they may be associated with very high levels of risk 
and because the greatest risks might not be associated with the most expected outcome. </p>

<p>The AR6 WGI report provides more detailed information about these types of events compared to the AR5 
(see Table 1.1, Section 1.4.4).  </p>

<p>Recognising the need for assessing and managing risk in situations of high uncertainty, the SROCC 
advanced the treatment of situations with deep uncertainty (IPCC, 2019b; Box 5 in Abram et al., 2019); 
Section 1.2.3). A situation of deep uncertainty exists when experts or stakeholders do not know or cannot 
agree on: (1) appropriate conceptual models that describe relationships among key driving forces in a 
system; (2) the probability distributions used to represent uncertainty about key variables and parameters; 
and/or (3) how to weigh and value desirable alternative outcomes (Abram et al., 2019). The concept of deep 
uncertainty can complement the IPCC calibrated language and thereby broaden the communication of risk. </p>
