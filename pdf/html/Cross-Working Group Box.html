<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Changes in the climate system are becoming increasingly apparent, as are the climate-related impacts on 
natural and human systems. Attribution is the process of evaluating the contribution of one or more causal 
factors to such observed changes or events. Typical questions addressed by the IPCC are for example: ‘To 
what degree is an observed change in global temperature induced by anthropogenic greenhouse gas and 
aerosol concentration changes or influenced by natural variability?’ or ‘What is the contribution of climate 
change to observed changes in crop yields that are also influenced by changes in agricultural management?’ 
Changes in the occurrence and intensity of extreme events can also be attributed, addressing questions such 
as: ‘Have human greenhouse gas emissions increased the likelihood or intensity of an observed heat wave?’ </p>

<p>This Cross-Working Group Box briefly describes why attribution studies are important. It also describes 
some new developments in the methods used and provides recommendations for interpretation. </p>

<p>Attribution studies serve to evaluate and communicate linkages associated with climate change, for example: 
between the human-induced increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and the observed increase in air 
temperature or extreme weather events (WGI Chapter 3, 10, 11); or between observed changes in climate 
and changing species distributions and food production (WGII Chapters 2 and others, summarised in Chapter 
16) (e.g., Verschuur et al., 2021); or between climate change mitigation policies and atmospheric greenhouse 
gas concentrations (WGI Chapter 5; WGIII Chapter 14). As such, they support numerous statements made 
by the IPCC (IPCC, 2013b, 2014b; WGI Chapter 1, Section 1.3, Appendix 1A). </p>

<p>Attribution assessments can also serve to monitor mitigation and assess the efficacy of applied climate 
protection policies (e.g., Nauels et al., 2019; Banerjee et al., 2020; WGI Chapter 4, Section 4.6.3), inform 
and constrain projections (Gillett et al., 2021; Ribes et al., 2021; WGI Chapter 4, Section 4.2.3) or inform the 
loss and damages estimates and potential climate litigation cases by estimating the costs of climate change 
(Huggel et al., 2015; Marjanac et al., 2017; Frame et al., 2020). These findings can thus inform mitigation 
decisions as well as risk management and adaptation planning (e.g., CDKN, 2017). </p>

<h3>Steps towards an attribution assessment</h3>

<p>The unambiguous framing of what is being attributed to what is a crucial first step for an assessment 
(Easterling et al., 2016; Hansen et al., 2016; Stone et al., 2021), followed by the identification of the possible 
and plausible drivers of change and the development of a hypothesis or theory for the linkage (see Cross-
Working Group Box: Attribution, Figure 1). The next step is to clearly define the indicators of the observed 
change or event and note the quality of the observations. There has been significant progress in the 
compilation of fragmented and distributed observational data, broadening and deepening the data basis for 
attribution research (e.g., Poloczanska et al., 2013; Ray et al., 2015; Cohen et al., 2018; WGI Chapter 1, 
Section 1.5). The quality of the observational record of drivers should also be considered (e.g., volcanic 
eruptions: WGI Chapter 2, section 2.2.2). Impacted systems also change in the absence of climate change; 
this baseline and its associated modifiers such as agricultural developments or population growth need to be 
considered, alongside the exposure and vulnerability of people depending on these systems. </p>

<p>There are many attribution approaches, and several methods are detailed below. In physical and biological 
systems, attribution often builds on the understanding of the mechanisms behind the observed changes and 
numerical models are used, while in human systems other methods of evidence-building are employed. 
Confidence in the attribution can be increased if more than one approach is used and the model is evaluated 
as fit-for-purpose (Hegerl et al., 2010; Vautard et al., 2019; Otto et al., 2020; Philip et al., 2020) (WGI 
Chapter 1, Section 1.5). Finally, appropriate communication of the attribution assessment and the 
accompanying confidence in the result (e.g., Lewis et al., 2019). </p>

<h3>Attribution methods</h3>

<h4>Attribution of changes in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations to anthropogenic activity</h4>

<p>AR6 WGI Chapter 5 presents multiple lines of evidence that unequivocally establish the dominant role of 
human activities in the growth of atmospheric CO2, including through analysing changes in atmospheric 
carbon isotope ratios and the atmospheric O2-N2 ratio (WGI Chapter 5, Section 5.2.1.1). Decomposition 
approaches can be used to attribute emissions underlying those changes to various drivers such as 
population, energy efficiency, consumption or carbon intensity (Hoekstra and van den Bergh, 2003; Raupach 
et al., 2007; Rosa and Dietz, 2012). Combined with attribution of their climate outcomes, the attribution of 
the sources of greenhouse gas emissions can inform the attribution of anthropogenic climate change to 
specific countries or actors (Matthews, 2016; Otto et al., 2017; Skeie et al., 2017; Nauels et al., 2019), and in 
turn inform discussions on fairness and burden sharing (WGIII Chapter 14). </p>

<h4>Attribution of observed climate change to anthropogenic forcing</h4>

<p>Changes in large-scale climate variables (e.g., global mean temperature) have been reliably attributed to 
anthropogenic and natural forcings (e.g., Hegerl et al., 2010; Bindoff et al., 2013; WGI Chapter 1, Section 
1.3.4). The most established method is to identify the ‘fingerprint’ of the expected space-time response to a 
particular climate forcing agent such as the concentration of anthropogenically induced greenhouse gases or 
aerosols, or natural variation of solar radiation. This technique disentangles the contribution of individual 
forcing agents to an observed change (e.g., Gillett et al., 2021). New statistical approaches have been applied 
to better account for internal climate variability and the uncertainties in models and observations (e.g., 
Naveau et al., 2018; Santer et al., 2019) (WGI, Chapter 3 Section 3.2). There are many other approaches, for 
example, global mean sea-level change has been attributed to anthropogenic climate forcing by attributing 
the individual contributions from, for example, glacier melt or thermal expansion, while also examining 
which aspects of the observed change are inconsistent with internal variability (WGI Chapter 3, Section 3.5.2 
and WGI Chapter 9, Section 9.6.1.4). </p>

<p>Specific regional conditions and responses may simplify or complicate attribution on those scales. For 
example, some human forcings, such as regional land use change or aerosols, may enhance or reduce 
regional signals of change (Lejeune et al., 2018; Undorf et al., 2018; Boé et al., 2020; Thiery et al., 2020; see 
also WGI Chapter 10, Section 10.4.2; WGI Chapter 11, Sections 11.1.6 and 11.2.2. In general, regional 
climate variations are larger than the global mean climate, adding additional uncertainty to attribution (e.g., 
in regional sea-level change, WGI Chapter 9, Section 9.6.1). These statistical limitations may be reduced by 
‘process-based attribution’, focusing on the physical processes known to influence the response to external 
forcing and internal variability (WGI Chapter 10, Section 10.4.2). </p>

<h4>Attribution of weather and climate events to anthropogenic forcing</h4>

<p>New methods have emerged since AR5 to attribute the change in likelihood or characteristics of weather or 
climate events or classes of events to underlying drivers (National Academies of Sciences Engineering and 
Medicine, 2016; Stott et al., 2016; Jézéquel et al., 2018; Wehner et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020; WGI 
Chapter 10, Section 10.4.1; WG1 Chapter 11, Section 11.2.2). Typically, historical changes, simulated under 
observed forcings, are compared to a counterfactual climate simulated in the absence of anthropogenic 
forcing. Another approach examines facets of the weather and thermodynamic status of an event through 
process-based attribution (Hauser et al., 2016; Shepherd et al., 2018b; Grose et al., 2019; WGI Chapter 10 
Section 10.4.1 and Chapter 11). Events where attributable human influences have been found include hot and 
cold temperature extremes (including some with wide-spread impacts), heavy precipitation, and certain types 
of droughts and tropical cyclones (e.g., Vogel et al., 2019; Herring et al., 2021; AR6 WGI Chapter 11, 
Section 11.9). Event attribution techniques have sometimes been extended to ‘end-to-end’ assessments from 
climate forcing to the impacts of events on natural or human systems (Otto, 2017, examples in WGII Table 
16.1, SI of WGII Chapter 16, Section 16.2). </p>

<h4>Attribution of observed changes in natural or human systems to climate-related drivers</h4>

<p>The attribution of observed changes to climate-related drivers across a diverse set of sectors, regions and 
systems is part of each chapter in the WGII contribution to the AR6 and is synthesised in WGII Chapter 16 
(Section 16.2). The number of attribution studies on climate change impacts has grown substantially since 
AR5, generally leading to higher confidence levels in attributing the causes of specific impacts. New studies 
include the attribution of changes in socio-economic indicators such as economic damages due to river 
floods (e.g., Schaller et al., 2016; Sauer et al., 2021), the occurrence of heat related human mortality (e.g., 
Sera et al., 2020, Vicedo-Cabrera et al., 2018;) or economic inequality (e.g., Diffenbaugh and Burke, 2019). </p>

<p>Impact attribution covers a diverse set of qualitative and quantitative approaches, building on experimental 
approaches, observations from remote sensing, long-term in situ observations, and monitoring efforts, 
teamed with local knowledge, process understanding and empirical or dynamical modelling (WGII Chapter 
16, Section 16.2; Stone et al., 2013; Cramer et al., 2014). The attribution of a change in a natural or human 
system (e.g., wild species, natural ecosystems, crop yields, economic development, infrastructure or human 
health) to changes in climate-related systems (i.e., climate, and ocean acidification, permafrost thawing or 
sea-level rise) requires accounting for other potential drivers of change, such as technological and economic 
changes in agriculture affecting crop production (Hochman et al., 2017; Butler et al., 2018), changes in 
human population patterns and vulnerability affecting flood or wildfire induced damages (Huggel et al., 
2015; Sauer et al., 2021), or habitat loss driving declines in wild species (IPBES, 2019). These drivers are 
accounted for by estimating a baseline condition that would exist in the absence of climate change. The 
baseline might be stationary and be approximated by observations from the past, or it may change over time 
and be simulated by statistical or process-based impact models (Cramer et al. 2014, WGII Chapter 16, 
Section 16.2). Assessment of multiple independent lines of evidence, taken together, can provide rigorous 
attribution when more quantitative approaches are not available (Parmesan et al., 2013). These include 
paleodata, physiological and ecological experiments, natural ‘experiments’ from very long-term datasets 
indicating consistent responses to the same climate trend/event, and ‘fingerprints’ in species' responses that 
are uniquely expected from climate change (e.g. poleward range boundaries expanding and equatorial range 
boundaries contracting in a coherent pattern world-wide, Parmesan and Yohe, 2003). Meta-analyses of 
species/ecosystem responses, when conducted with wide geographic coverage, also provide a globally 
coherent signal of climate change at an appropriate scale for attribution to anthropogenic climate change 
(Parmesan and Yohe, 2003; Parmesan et al., 2013). </p>

<p>Impact attribution does not always involve attribution to anthropogenic climate forcing. However, a growing 
number of studies include this aspect (e.g., Frame et al., 2020 for the attribution of damages induced by 
hurricane Harvey; or Diffenbaugh and Burke, 2019 for the attribution of economic inequality between 
countries; or Schaller et al., 2016 for flood damages). </p>
