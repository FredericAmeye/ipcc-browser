<p>Spatial information on observed and projected future climate changes has always been a key output of IPCC 
reports. This information is typically represented in the form of maps of historical trends (from observational 
datasets) and of projected changes for future reference periods and scenarios relative to baseline periods 
(from multi-model ensembles). These maps usually include information on the robustness or uncertainty of 
the results such as the significance of trends or the consistency of the change across models. Visualization of 
this information combines two aspects that are intertwined: the core methodology (measures and thresholds) 
and its visual implementation. For observed trends, robustness can be simply ascertained by using an 
appropriate statistical significance test. However, for multi-model mean changes, the consistency across 
models for the sign of change (model agreement) and the magnitude of change relative to unforced climate 
variability (signal-to-noise ratio) provide two complementary measures allowing for simple or more 
comprehensive approaches to represent robustness and uncertainty. While they can be visually represented in 
various ways with more or less complexity (Retchless and Brewer, 2016), the most common implementation 
for maps in the climate science community remains the overlay of symbols and/or masking of the primary 
variable. This Cross-Chapter Box reviews the approaches followed in previous IPCC reports and describes 
the methods used across this WGI report, presenting the rationale and discussing its relative merits and 
limitations. </p>

<p>The objectives in AR6 for representing robustness and uncertainty in maps are 1) adopting a method that can 
be as coherent as possible across the different global/regional chapters while accommodating different needs, 
2) being visually consistent across WGs, and 3) making the different layers of information on the maps as 
accessible as possible for the reader. As a result, a single approach is selected for observations and two 
alternative approaches (simple and advanced) are adopted for projected future changes. It is important to 
highlight that, as in previous reports, these approaches are implemented in maps at a grid-box level and, 
therefore, are not informative for larger spatial scales (e.g., over AR6 reference regions) where the 
aggregated signals are less affected by small-scale variability leading to an increase in robustness. This is 
particularly relevant for the AR6 regional assessments and approaches (e.g., for trend detection and 
attribution, Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Section 11.2.4) which are performed for climatological regions and not 
at grid-box scale (Chapters 11, 12, Atlas). Both small and large scales are relevant (e.g., adaptation occurs at 
the smaller scales but also at the level of countries, which are typically larger than a few grid boxes). They 
are both addressed in the Interactive Atlas, which implements the above approaches for representing 
robustness in maps at the grid-box level, but also allows analysing region-wide signals (e.g., AR6 WG I 
reference regions, monsoon regions, etc.), helping to isolate background changes happening at larger scales 
(Section Atlas.2.2).  </p>

<h3>Approaches used in previous reports</h3>

<p>Recent IPCC reports adopted different approaches for mapping uncertainty/robustness, including their 
calculation method and/or their visual implementation. In AR5 WGI ‘+’ symbols were used to represent 
significant trends in observations at grid-box level. For future projections, different methods for mapping 
robustness were assessed (AR5 Box 12.1, Collins et al., 2013), while proposing as a reference an approach 
based on relating the multi-model mean climate change signal to internal variability, calculated as the 
standard deviation of non-overlapping 20-year means in the pre-industrial control runs. Regions where the 
multi-model mean change exceeded two standard deviations of the internal variability and where at least 
90% of the models agreed on the sign of change were stippled (as an indication of a robust signal). Regions 
where the multi-model change was less than one standard deviation were hatched (small multi-model mean 
signal). However, this category did not distinguish areas with consistent small changes from areas of 
significant but opposing/divergent signals. In addition, the unstippled/unhatched areas were left undefined, 
since the categories were not mutually exclusive. </p>

<p>AR5 WGII (Hewitson et al., 2014) used hatching to represent non-significant trends in observations. For 
future projections, an elaborated approach with four mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories was 
proposed (to avoid some of the limitations of the AR5 WGI approach): very strong agreement (same as in 
WGI); strong agreement; divergent change; and little or no change. These depended on the percentage of 
models showing change greater than the baseline variability and/or agreeing on sign of change (using a 66% 
agreement threshold). Leaving the robust regions uncovered minimized any interference with the perception 
of underlying colours that encoded the primary information of the figure.  </p>

<p>The two special reports IPCC SR1.5 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018) and SROCC (IPCC, 2019a, 2019c) 
adopted a simplified approach, using only model agreement (≥66% of models agree on sign of change) to 
characterize robustness. However, cross-hatching was used in SR1.5 to highlight robust areas where models 
agree, whereas the SROCC used hatching/shading to represent regions where models disagree. Similarly, 
stippling was used in SR1.5 to indicate regions with significant trends, whereas it was used in SROCC to 
represent regions where the trends were not significant.  </p>

<h2>Recent methodologies</h2>

<p>Since AR5 there has been a growing interest for disentangling small consistent climate change signals from 
significant divergent opposite changes resulting in conflicting information (Tebaldi et al., 2011), and 
different statistical tests have been applied to assess the significance of signals working with the individual 
models forming the ensemble (Dosio and Fischer, 2018; Yang et al., 2018; Morim et al., 2019). Moreover, 
new approaches have been proposed to identify large changes of opposite sign that compensate in the mean 
(Zappa et al., 2021). Recent literature has also highlighted the respective risks of Type I vs Type II errors, 
which can be associated with the determination of robustness in analysed signals (Lloyd and Oreskes, 2018; 
Knutson et al., 2019). Type I errors are identifying signals when there are none, while Type II errors are 
concluding there is no signal when there is one. In the case of grid-box level analysis, the focus on small-
scale features with inherently large signal-to-noise ratio may emphasize noise even though signals are 
present when aggregated at larger scale (Sections 11.2.4 and 11.2.5). Consequently, changes averaged over 
regions or a number of grid-boxes emerge from internal variability at a lower level of warming than at the 
grid-box level (e.g., Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1, Figure 2). Hence, focus on grid-box significance enhances 
the risk of Type II errors for overlooking signals significant at the level of AR6 regions. The significance of 
signals is also affected by interdependence of single simulations considered in a given ensemble, for example 
when several come from the same modelling group and share parameterizations or model components 
(Knutti et al., 2013; Maher et al., 2021). The risk of Type II errors increases when a model ensemble 
includes several related simulations showing no signal. </p>

<h2>The AR6 WGI approach</h2>

<p>AR6 WGI adapts the approaches applied in previous IPCC reports into a comprehensive framework based 
on the two general principles followed by AR5 WGII: 1) not obscuring (with stippling or hatching) the areas 
where relevant/robust information needs to be highlighted (since stippling and hatching obstruct the 
visualisation of the colours, which can affect the perception/interpretation of the underlying data); 2) using 
mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories to avoid leaving areas undefined. The three adopted 
approaches (one for observations and two for model projections) are described in Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1, 
Table 1. This framework integrates as much as possible the specificities of each WGI Chapter, proposing in 
some cases alternative thresholds.  </p>

<p><em>Approach A</em> is intended for observations and consists of two categories, one for areas with significant trends 
(colour, no overlay) and one for non-significant ones (coloured areas overlaid with ‘x’), typically using a 
two-sided test for a significance level of 0.1; Chapter 2 and Atlas trends have been calculated using OLS 
regression accounting for serial correlation (Santer et al., 2008). </p>

<p><em>Approach B</em> is the simple alternative for model projections. It consists of two categories, one for model 
agreement (at least 80% of the models agree on the sign of change; colour, no overlay) and the other one for 
non-agreement (hatching). It is noted that model agreement is computed using ‘model democracy’ (i.e. 
without discarding/weighting models), since quantifying and accounting for model interdependence (shared 
building blocks) still remain challenging (Section 4.2.6). Different thresholds have been used in previous 
reports and in the literature. 80% has been widely used in CORDEX studies (Dosio and Fischer, 2018; 
Kjellström et al., 2018; Nikulin et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018; Akperov et al., 2019; Rana et al., 2020) 
partially due to the small ensemble sizes available in some cases; this also helps to reduce the impact of 
model interdependence in the final results. Although 90% (used in AR5 WGI) provides high confidence on 
the forced change, it is deemed too stringent for precipitation-like variables and regional assessments and 
was therefore not included (see Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1, Figure 1). The 66% threshold, which has been 
used in previous reports (e.g., SR1.5 and SROCC) and in the literature, is not used to avoid communicating 
weak confidence. Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1, Figure 1 illustrates the application of this approach.  </p>

<p><em>Approach C</em> is a more advanced alternative for model projections, extending the AR5 WGI and simplifying 
the AR5 WGII approaches (fewer categories). It consists of three categories: ‘robust change’, ‘conflicting 
change’, and ‘no change or no robust change’ (see the details in Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1, Table 1). The 
first two categories can be interpreted as areas where the climate change signal likely emerges from internal 
variability (i.e., it exceeds the variability threshold in ≥66% of the models). The variability threshold is 
defined as <math>\gamma =  \sqrt{2}  \cdot  1.645 \cdot \sigma_{20yr}</math>, where <math>\sigma_{20yr}</math> is the standard deviation of 20-year means, computed from 
non-overlapping periods in the pre-industrial control (after detrending with a quadratic fit as in AR5 WG1); 
in cases where this information is not available (e.g., for CORDEX or HighResMIP), the following 
approximation is used instead: <math>\gamma =  \sqrt{2/20}  \cdot  1.645 \cdot \sigma_{1yr}</math>, where <math>\sigma_{1yr}</math> is the interannual standard deviation measured in a linearly detrended modern period (note that for white noise <math>\sigma_{20yr} = \sigma_{1yr} / \sqrt{20}</math>). The factor √2 is used as in the AR5 WGI approach to account for the fact that the variability of a difference in means (the 
climate change signal) is of interest. This approach is an evolution of AR5 WGI method with three notable 
differences: (a) AR6 uses a lower threshold for internal variability (1.645 corresponding to a 90% confidence 
level, instead of 2 as used in AR5 WG1); (b) the threshold on agreement in sign is lowered from ≥90% to 
≥80%, leading to more grid boxes classified as robust as opposed to conflicting signal; (c) the AR6 method 
compares signal to variability in each individual model and consequently introduces a 66% cut-off on 
significant changes implying that the climate change signal likely emerges from internal variability in the 
baseline period. This change is motivated by the criticisms of internal variability of the models, while it can 
differ largely across models. </p>

<p>Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1, Figure 1 illustrates the application of this method considering the effect of the 
baseline period (1850–1900 versus 1995–2014) and shows that it provides similar results to related 
approaches proposed in the literature (Zappa et al., 2021).  </p>

<p>The two alternative approaches discussed above allow visualisation of different level of detail of information 
on the projected change and are intended for different communication purposes. Approach B just informs on 
the consistency of the sign of change independent of its significance relative to internal variability, whereas 
approach C puts the projected changes into context of internal variability and allows highlighting of areas of 
conflicting signals. It is important to note that different approaches can be applied to the same variable 
between different chapters for different communication purposes. For example, in maps showing multi-
model mean changes of precipitation, Chapter 4 adopts the approach C but Chapter 8 applies the approach B.  </p>

<p>In terms of visual implementation, the approach follows recommendations resulting from conversations with 
IPCC national delegations: 1) having a consistent approach across WGs would aid consistency and reduce 
the risk of confusion; 2) defining ‘hatching’ as ‘diagonal lines’ in the caption would aid accessibility for non-
expert audiences; 3) a clear and concise legend that explains what these patterns represent should be included 
directly in the figure; 4) information about model uncertainty should be overlaid such that it does not detract 
from the data underneath. </p>

<p>Since stippling is commonly used to represent statistical significance, hatching was chosen to ‘obscure’ the 
problematic categories in the above approaches; it also facilitates the visualisation of uncertainty in the 
Interactive Atlas when zooming in. To avoid confusion, methods or thresholds that were unrelated to the 
three approaches hereby presented were visualised with a different pattern (i.e., model improvement between 
low- and high-resolution simulations in Chapter 3; agreement between observation-based products in 
Chapter 5; correlation between two variables in Chapter 6).  </p>

<h2>Uncertainty at the grid-box and regional scales: interpreting hatched areas</h2>

<p>There is no one-size-fits-all method for representing robustness or uncertainty in future climate projections 
from a multi-model ensemble. One of the main challenges is the dependence of the significance on the 
spatial scale of interest: while a significant trend may not be detected at every location, a fraction of 
locations showing significant trends can be sufficient to indicate a significant change over a region, 
particularly for extremes (e.g., it is likely that annual maximum 1-day precipitation has intensified over the 
land regions globally even though there are only about 10% of weather stations showing significant trends; 
Figure 11.13). The approach adopted in WGI works at a grid-box level and, therefore, is not informative for 
assessing climate change signals over larger spatial scales. For instance, an assessment of the amount of 
warming required for a robust climate change signal to emerge can strongly depend on the considered spatial 
scale. A robust change in the precipitation extremes averaged over a region or a number of grid-boxes 
emerge at a lower level of warming than at the grid-box level because of larger variability at the smaller 
scale (Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1, Figure 2). </p>
