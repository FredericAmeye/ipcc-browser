<p>The new nine SSP emission and concentration scenarios (SSP1-1.9 to SSP5-8.5; Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, 
Table 1) offer unprecedented detail of input data for climate model simulations. They allow for a more 
comprehensive assessment of climate drivers and responses than has previously been available, in particular 
because some of the scenarios’ time series, e.g., pollutants, emissions or changes in land use and land cover, 
are more diverse in the SSP scenarios than in the RCPs used in AR5 (e.g., Chuwah et al., 2013) (Cross-
Chapter Box 1.4, Figure 2).  </p>

<p>The core set of five SSP scenarios SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 was selected in 
this Report to align with the objective that the new generation of SSP scenarios should fill certain gaps 
identified in the RCPs. For example, a scenario assuming reduced air pollution control and thus higher 
aerosol emissions was missing from the RCPs. Likewise, nominally the only ‘no-additional-climate-policy’ 
scenario in the set of RCPs was RCP8.5. The new SSP3-7.0 ‘no-additional-climate-policy’ scenario fills both 
these gaps. A very strong mitigation scenario in line with the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement was also 
missing from the RCPs, and the SSP1-1.9 scenario now fills this gap, complementing the other strong 
mitigation scenario SSP1-2.6. The five core SSPs were also chosen to ensure some overlap with the RCP 
levels for radiative forcing at the year 2100 (specifically 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5) (O’Neill et al., 2016; Tebaldi et 
al., 2021), although effective radiative forcings are generally higher in the SSP scenarios compared to the 
equivalently-named RCP pathways (Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Figure 1; Chapter 4, Section 4.6.2). In theory, 
running scenarios with similar radiative forcings would permit analysis of the CMIP5 and CMIP6 outcomes 
for pairs of scenarios (e.g., RCP8.5 and SSP5-8.5) in terms of varying model characteristics rather than 
differences in the underlying scenarios. In practice, however, there are limitations to this approach (Section 
1.6.1.1 and Chapter 4, Section 4.6.2).  </p>

<p>In contrast to stylized assumptions about the future evolution of emissions (e.g., a linear phase-out from year 
A to year B), these SSP scenarios are the result of a detailed scenario generation process (see Sections 
1.6.1.1 and 1.6.1.2). While IAMs produce internally-consistent future emission time series for CO2, CH4, 
N2O, and aerosols for the SSP scenarios (Riahi et al., 2017; Rogelj et al., 2018a), these emission scenarios 
are subject to several processing steps for harmonisation (Gidden et al., 2018) and in-filling (Lamboll et al., 
2020), before also being complemented by several datasets so that ESMs can run these SSPs (Durack et al., 
2018; Tebaldi et al., 2021). Although five scenarios are the primary focus of WGI, a total of nine SSP 
scenarios have been prepared with all the necessary detail to drive the ESMs as part of the CMIP6 (Cross-
Chapter Box 1.4, Figure 1 and Table 2).  </p>

<p>ESMs are driven by either emission or concentration scenarios. Inferring concentration changes from 
emission time series requires using carbon cycle and other gas cycle models. To aid comparability across 
ESMs, and in order to allow participation of ESMs that do not have coupled carbon and other gas cycles 
models in CMIP6, most of the CMIP6 ESM experiments are so-called ‘concentration-driven’ runs, with 
concentrations of CO2, CH4, N2O and other well-mixed GHGs prescribed in conjunction with aerosol 
emissions, ozone changes and effects from human-induced land cover changes that may be radiatively active 
via albedo changes (Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Figure 2). In these concentration-driven climate projections, the 
uncertainty in projected future climate change resulting from our limited understanding of how the carbon 
cycle and other gas cycles will evolve in the future is not captured. For example, when deriving the default 
concentrations for these scenarios, permafrost and other carbon cycle feedbacks are considered using default 
settings, with a single time series prescribed for all ESMs (Meinshausen et al., 2020). Thus, associated 
uncertainties (Joos et al., 2013; Schuur et al., 2015) are not considered. </p>

<p>The so-called ‘emission-driven’ experiments (Jones et al., 2016b) use the same input datasets as 
concentration-driven ESM experiments, except that they use CO2 emissions rather than concentrations 
(Chapter 4, Section 4.3.1; Chapter 5). In these experiments, atmospheric CO2 concentrations are calculated 
internally using the ESM interactive carbon cycle module and thus differ from the prescribed default CO2 
concentrations used in the concentration-driven runs. In the particular case of SSP5-8.5, the emission-driven 
runs are assessed to add no significant additional uncertainty to future global surface air temperature (GSAT) 
projections (Chapter 4, Section 4.3.1). However, generally, when assessing uncertainties in future climate 
projections, it is important to consider which elements of the cause-effect chain from emissions to the 
resulting climate change are interactively included as part of the model projections, and which are externally 
prescribed using default settings.  </p>
