<p>A key novel element in the AR6 is the WGI Atlas, which includes the Interactive Atlas. The Interactive Atlas 
provides the ability to explore much of the observational and climate model data used as lines of evidence in 
this assessment to generate regional climate information. {10.6.4, Atlas.2, Interactive Atlas} </p>

<p>A significant innovation in the AR6 WGI report is the Atlas. Part of its remit is to provide region-by-region 
assessment  on  changes  in  mean  climate  and  to  link  with  other  WGI  chapters  to  generate  climate  change 
information for the regions. An important component is the new online interactive tool, the Interactive Atlas, 
with  flexible  spatial  and  temporal  analyses  of  much  of  the  observed,  simulated  past  and  projected  future 
climate change data underpinning the WGI assessment. This includes the ability to generate global maps and 
a number of regionally aggregated products (time series, scatter plots, tables, etc.) for a range of observations 
and ensemble climate change projections of variables (such as changes in the CIDs summarized in Table TS.5) 
from CMIP5, CORDEX and CMIP6. The data can be displayed and summarized under a range of SSP-RCP 
scenarios  and  future  time  slices  and  also  for  different  global  warming  levels,  relative  to  several  different 
baseline periods. The maps and various statistics can be generated for annual mean trends and changes or for 
any user-specified season. A new set of WGI reference regions is used for the regional summary statistics and 
applied widely throughout the report (with the regions available, along with aggregated datasets and the code 
to generate these at the ATLAS GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/IPCC-WG1/Atlas">https://github.com/IPCC-WG1/Atlas</a>).  </p>

<p>Box TS.12, Figure 1 shows how the Interactive Atlas products, together with other lines of evidence, can be 
used to generate climate information for an illustrative example of the Mediterranean summer warming. The 
lines of evidence include the understanding of relevant mechanisms, dynamic and thermodynamic processes 
and the effect of aerosols in this case (Box TS.12, Figure 1a), trends in observational datasets (which can have 
different spatial and temporal coverage â€“ Box TS.12, Figure 1b, c), attribution of these trends and temperature 
projections from global and regional climate models at different resolutions, including single-model initial-
condition large ensembles (SMILEs; Box TS.12, Figure 1d, e). Taken together, this evidence shows there is 
high confidence that the projected Mediterranean summer temperature increase will be larger than in the global 
mean with consistent results from CMIP5 and CMIP6 (Box TS.12, Figure 1e). However, CMIP6 results project 
both more pronounced warming than CMIP5 for a given emissions scenario and time period and a greater 
range of changes (Box TS.12, Figure 1d). {10.6.4, Atlas.2, Interactive Atlas}  </p>
