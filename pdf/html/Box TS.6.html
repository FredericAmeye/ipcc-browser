<p>Human-caused climate change has driven detectable changes in the global water cycle since the mid-20th 
century (high confidence), and it is projected to cause substantial further changes at both global and regional 
scales (high confidence). Global land precipitation has likely increased since 1950, with a faster increase 
since the 1980s (medium confidence). Atmospheric water vapour has increased throughout the troposphere 
since at least the 1980s (likely). Annual global land precipitation will increase over the 21st century as global 
surface temperature increases (high confidence). Human influence has been detected in amplified surface 
salinity and precipitation minus evaporation (P-E) patterns over the ocean (high confidence). The severity of 
very wet and very dry events increase in a warming climate (high confidence), but changes in atmospheric 
circulation patterns affect where and how often these extremes occur. Water cycle variability and related 
extremes are projected to increase faster than mean changes in most regions of the world and under all 
emission scenarios (high confidence). Over the 21st century, the total land area subject to drought will 
increase and droughts will become more frequent and severe (high confidence). Near-term projected changes 
in precipitation are uncertain mainly because of internal variability, model uncertainty and uncertainty in 
forcings from natural and anthropogenic aerosols (medium confidence). Over the 21st century and beyond, 
abrupt human-caused changes to the water cycle cannot be excluded (medium confidence). {2.3, 3.3, 4.3, 4.4,

<p>There is high confidence that the global water cycle has intensified since at least 1980 expressed by, for 
example, increased atmospheric moisture fluxes and amplified precipitation minus evaporation patterns. 
Global land precipitation has likely increased since 1950, with a faster increase since the 1980s (medium 
confidence), and a likely human contribution to patterns of change, particularly for increases in high-latitude 
precipitation over the Northern Hemisphere. Increases in global mean precipitation are determined by a 
robust response to global surface temperature (very likely 2–3% per °C) that is partly offset by fast 
atmospheric adjustments to atmospheric heating by GHGs and aerosols (TS.3.2.2). The overall effect of 
anthropogenic aerosols is to reduce global precipitation through surface radiative cooling effects (high 
confidence). Over much of the 20th century, opposing effects of GHGs and aerosols on precipitation have 
been observed for some regional monsoons (high confidence) (Box TS.13). Global annual precipitation over 
land is projected to increase on average by 2.4% (–0.2% to 4.7% likely range) under SSP1-1.9, 4.6% (1.5% 
to 8.3% likely range) under SSP2-4.5, and 8.3% (0.9% to 12.9% likely range) under SSP5-8.5 by 2081–2100 
relative to 1995–2014 (Box TS.6, Figure 1). Inter-model differences and internal variability contribute to a 
substantial range in projections of large-scale and regional water cycle changes (high confidence). The 
occurrence of volcanic eruptions can alter the water cycle for several years (high confidence). Projected 
patterns of precipitation change exhibit substantial regional differences and seasonal contrast as global 
surface temperature increases over the 21st century (Box TS.6, Figure 1). {2.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.5.2, 4.3.1, 
4.4.1, 4.5.1, 4.6.1, Cross-Chapter Box 4.1, 8.2.1, 8.2.2, 8.2.3, Box 8.1, 8.3.2.4, 8.4.1, 8.5.2, 10.4.2}  </p>

<p>Global total column water vapour content has very likely increased since the 1980s, and it is likely that 
human influence has contributed to tropical upper tropospheric moistening. Near-surface specific humidity 
has increased over the ocean (likely) and land (very likely) since at least the 1970s, with a detectable human 
influence (medium confidence). Human influence has been detected in amplified surface salinity and 
precipitation minus evaporation (P-E) patterns over the ocean (high confidence). It is virtually certain that 
evaporation will increase over the ocean, and very likely that evapotranspiration will increase over land, with 
regional variations under future surface warming (Box TS.6, Figure 1). There is high confidence that 
projected increases in precipitation amount and intensity will be associated with increased runoff in northern 
high latitudes (Box TS.6, Figure 1). In response to cryosphere changes (TS.2.5), there have been changes in 
streamflow seasonality, including an earlier occurrence of peak streamflow in high-latitude and mountain 
catchments (high confidence). Projected runoff (Box TS.6, Figure 1c) is typically decreased by contributions 
from small glaciers because of glacier mass loss, while runoff from larger glaciers will generally increase 
with increasing global warming levels until their mass becomes depleted (high confidence). {2.3.1, 3.3.2, 
3.3.3, 3.5.2, 8.2.3, 8.4.1, 11.5}  </p>

<p>Warming over land drives an increase in atmospheric evaporative demand and in the severity of drought 
events (high confidence). Greater warming over land than over the ocean alters atmospheric circulation 
patterns and reduces continental near-surface relative humidity, which contributes to regional drying (high 
confidence). A very likely decrease in relative humidity has occurred over much of the global land area since 
2000. Projected increases in evapotranspiration due to growing atmospheric water demand will decrease soil 
moisture (Box TS.6, Figure 1) over the Mediterranean region, southwestern North America, South Africa, 
southwestern South America and southwestern Australia (high confidence). Some tropical regions are also 
projected to experience enhanced aridity, including the Amazon basin and Central America (high 
confidence). The total land area subject to increasing drought frequency and severity will expand (high 
confidence), and in the Mediterranean, southwestern South America, and western North America, future 
aridification will far exceed the magnitude of change seen in the last millennium (high confidence). {4.5.1, 
8.2.2, 8.2.3, 8.4.1, Box 8.2, 11.6, 11.9} </p>

<p>Land-use change and water extraction for irrigation have influenced local and regional responses in the water 
cycle (high confidence). Large-scale deforestation likely decreases evapotranspiration and precipitation and 
increases runoff over the deforested regions relative to the regional effects of climate change (medium 
confidence). Urbanization increases local precipitation (medium confidence) and runoff intensity (high 
confidence) (Box TS.14:). Increased precipitation intensities have enhanced groundwater recharge, most 
notably in tropical regions (medium confidence). There is high confidence that groundwater depletion has 
occurred since at least the start of the 21st century, as a consequence of groundwater withdrawals for 
irrigation in agricultural areas in drylands. {8.2.3, 8.3.1, 11.1.6, 11.4, 11.6, FAQ 8.1} </p>

<p>Water cycle variability and related extremes are projected to increase faster than mean changes in most 
regions of the world and under all emissions scenarios (high confidence). A warmer climate increases 
moisture transport into weather systems, which intensifies wet seasons and events (high confidence). The 
magnitudes of projected precipitation increases and related extreme events depend on model resolution and 
the representation of convective processes (high confidence). Increases in near-surface atmospheric moisture 
capacity of about 7% per 1ºC of warming lead to a similar response in the intensification of heavy 
precipitation from sub-daily up to seasonal time scales, increasing the severity of flood hazards (high 
confidence). The average and maximum rain-rates associated with tropical and extratropical cyclones, 
atmospheric rivers and severe convective storms will therefore also increase with future warming (high 
confidence). For some regions, there is medium confidence that peak tropical cyclone rain-rates will increase 
by more than 7% per 1°C of warming due to increased low-level moisture convergence caused by increases 
in wind intensity. In the tropics year-round and in the summer season elsewhere, interannual variability of 
precipitation and runoff over land is projected to increase at a faster rate than changes in seasonal mean 
precipitation (Figure TS.12e,f) (medium confidence). Sub-seasonal precipitation variability is also projected 
to increase with fewer rainy days but increased daily mean precipitation intensity over many land regions 
(high confidence). {4.5.3, 8.2.3, 8.4.1, 8.4.2, 8.5.1, 8.5.2, 11.4,11.5, 11.7, 11.9} </p>
