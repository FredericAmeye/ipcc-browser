<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Traditionally, projections of climate variables are summarized and communicated as function of time and 
scenario. Recently, quantifying global and regional climate at specific global warming levels (GWLs) has 
become widespread, motivated by the inclusion of explicit GWLs in the long-term temperature goal of the 
Paris Agreement (Section 1.6.2). GWLs, expressed as changes in global surface temperature relative to the 
1850-1900 period (see CCBox 2.3), are used in the SR15 and in the assessment of Reasons for Concerns in 
the WGII reports (see also CCBox 12.1). CCB 11.1, Figure 1 illustrates how the assessment of the climate 
response at GWLs relates to the uncertainty in scenarios regarding the timing of the respective GWLs, as 
well as to the uncertainty in the associated regional climate responses, including extremes and other climatic 
impact-drivers (CIDs). For many (but not all) climate variables and CIDs the response pattern for a given 
GWL is consistent across different scenarios (Chapters 1, 4, 9, 11 and Atlas). GWLs are defined as long-
term means (e.g. 20-year averages) compared to the pre-industrial period, are commonly used in the 
literature and were also underlying main assessments of SR15 (Chapter 3).  </p>

<p>Numerous studies have compared the regional response to anthropogenic forcing at GWLs in annual and 
seasonal mean values and extremes of different climate and impact variables across different multi-model 
ensembles and/or different scenarios (e.g. Frieler et al., 2012; Schewe et al., 2014; Schleussner et al., 2016; 
Seneviratne et al., 2016; Wartenburger et al., 2017; Dosio and Fischer, 2018; Tebaldi et al., 2020; (Herger et 
al., 2015; Betts et al., 2018; Samset et al., 2019), see Sections 4.6.1, 8.5.3, 9.3.1, 9.5, 9.6.3, 10.4.3 and 11.2.4 
for further details). The regional response patterns at given GWLs have been found to be consistent across 
different scenarios for many climate variables (CC-Box 11.1 Fig.2) (Pendergrass et al., 2015; Seneviratne et 
al., 2016; Wartenburger et al., 2017; Seneviratne and Hauser, 2020). The consistency tends to be higher for 
temperature-related variables than for variables in the hydrological cycle or variables characterizing 
atmospheric dynamics, and for intermediate to high emission scenarios than for low-emission scenarios (e.g. 
for mean precipitation in the RCP2.6 scenario: Pendergrass et al., 2015; Wartenburger et al., 2017). 
Nonetheless, CCB 11.1 Figure 2 illustrates that even for mean precipitation, which is known to be forcing-
dependent (Section 4.6.1 and Section 8.5.3), scenario differences in the response pattern at a given GWL are 
smaller than model uncertainty and internal variability in many regions (Herger et al., 2015). The response 
pattern is further found to be broadly consistent between models that reach a GWL relatively early and those 
that reach it later under a given SSP (see CC Box 11.1 Fig.2 g, h) </p>

<p>In contrast to linear pattern scaling (Mitchell, 2003; Collins et al., 2013a), the use of GWLs as a dimension 
of integration does not require linearity in the response of a climate variable. It is thus even useful for metrics 
which do not show a linear response, such as the frequency of heat extremes over land and oceans (Fischer 
and Knutti, 2015; Perkins-Kirkpatrick and Gibson, 2017; Frölicher et al., 2018; Kharin et al., 2018) if the 
relationship of the variable of interest to the GWL is scenario independent. The latter means that the 
response is independent of the pathway and relative contribution of various radiative forcings. For some 
more complex indices like warm-spell duration or for regions with strong aerosol changes, discrepancies can 
be larger (Wang et al., 2017d; King et al., 2018; Tebaldi et al., 2020) (see also subsection below on GWLs vs 
scenarios for further caveats).  </p>

<p>The limited scenario dependence of the GWL-based response for many variables implies that the regional 
response to emissions scenarios can be split in almost independent contributions of 1) the transient global 
warming response to scenarios (see Chapter 4), and 2) the regional response as function of a given GWL, 
which has also been referred to as “regional climate sensitivity” (Seneviratne and Hauser, 2020). This 
property has also been used to develop regionally-resolved emulators for global climate models, using global 
surface temperature as input (Beusch et al., 2020; Tebaldi et al., 2020). Analyses of the CMIP6 and CMIP5 
multi-model ensembles shows that the GWL-based responses are very similar for temperature and 
precipitation extremes across the ensembles (Li et al., 2020a; Seneviratne and Hauser, 2020; Wehner, 2020). 
This is despite their difference in global warming response (Chapter 4), confirming a substantial decoupling 
between the two responses (global warming vs GWL-based regional response) for these variables. Thus, the 
GWL approach isolates the uncertainty in the regional climate response from the global warming uncertainty 
induced by scenario, global mean model response and internal variability (CCB Figure 1). </p>

<h3>Mapping between GWL- and scenario-based responses in model analyses</h3>

<p>To map scenario-based climate projections into changes at specific GWLs, first, all individual ESM 
simulations that reach a certain GWL are identified. Second, the climate response patterns at the respective 
GWL are calculated using an approach termed here “GWL-sampling approach” – sometimes also referred to 
as epoch analysis, time shift, or time sampling approach –, taking into account all models and scenarios 
(CCB Figure 3). Note that the range of years when a given GWL is reached in the CMIP6 ensemble is 
different from the AR6 assessed range of projected global surface temperature (Table 4.5; Section 4.3.4). 
The latter further takes into account different lines of evidence, including the assessed observed warming 
between pre-industrial and present day, information from observational constraints on CMIP6, and emulators 
using the assessed transient climate response (TCR) and equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) ranges 
(Section 4.3.4). Hence the Chapter 4 assessed range (Table 4.5) is the reference to determine when a given 
GWL is likely reached under given scenarios, while the mapping between scenarios/time frames and GWLs 
is used to assess the respective regional responses happening at these time frames (which also allows to 
account for the global surface temperature assessment rather than using scenarios analyses directly from 
CMIP6 output).  </p>

<p>In the model-based asssessment of Chapters 4, 8, 10, 11, 12 and the Atlas, the estimation of changes at 
GWLs are generally defined as the 20-year time period in which the mean global surface air temperature 
(GSAT; CCBox 2.3) first exceeds a certain anomaly relative to 1850-1900 (for simulations that start after 
1850, relative to all years up to 1900 CCB Figure 3). The years when each individual model reaches a given 
GWL for CMIP6 and CMIP5 can be found in Hauser et al. (2021). The changes at given GWLs are 
identified for each ensemble member (for all scenarios) individually. Thereby, a given GWL is potentially 
reached a few years earlier or later in different realizations of the same model due to internal variability, but 
the temperature averaged across the 20-year period analysed in any simulation is consistent with the GWL. 
Instead of blending the information from the different scenarios, the Interactive Atlas can be used to compare 
the GWL spatial patterns and timings across the different scenarios (see Section Atlas 1.3.1).  </p>

<h3>Mapping between GWL- and scenario-based responses for literature</h3>

<p>A large fraction of the literature considers scenario-based analyses for given time slices. When GWL-based 
information is required instead, an approximated mapping of the multi-model mean can be derived based on 
the known GWL in the given experiments for a particular time period. As a rough approximation, CMIP6 
multi-model mean projections for the near-term (2021-2040) correspond to changes at about 1.5°C, and 
projections for the high-end scenario (SSP5-8.5) for the long-term (2081-2100) correspond to about 4-5°C of 
global warming (see Table 4.2 for changes in the CMIP6 ensemble and the Chapter 11 Supplementary 
Material (11.SM.1) and Hauser (2021) for details on other time periods and CMIP5). These approximated 
changes are for instance used for some of the GWL-based assessments provided in the Chapter 11 regional 
tables (Section 11.9; Table 11.3) when literature based on scenario projections is used to assessed estimated 
changes at given GWLs. </p>

<h3>GWLs vs scenarios</h3>

<p>The use of scenarios remains a key element to inform mitigation decisions (Chapter 1, CCB1.4), to assess 
which emission pathways are consistent with a certain GWL (CCB1.4 Figure1), to estimate when certain 
GWLs are reached (Section 4.3.4), and to assess for which variables it is meaningful to use GWLs as a 
dimension of integration. The use of scenarios is also essential for variables whose climate response strongly 
depends on the contribution of radiative forcing (e.g. aerosols) and land use and land management changes, 
and are time and warming rate dependent (e.g. sea level rise), or differ between transient and quasi-
equilibrium states. Furthermore, the use of concentration or emission-driven scenario simulations is required 
if regional climate assessments need to account for the uncertainty in GSAT changes or climate-carbon 
feedbacks. </p>

<p>Forcing dependence of the GWL response is found for global mean precipitation (Section 8.4.3), but less for 
regional patterns of mean precipitation changes (CC-Box 11.1, Fig. 2). Limited dependence is found for 
extremes, as highlighted above. In the cryosphere, elements that are quick to respond to warming like sea ice 
area, permafrost, and snow show little scenario dependence (Chapter 9.3.1.1, 9.5.2.3, 9.5.3.3), whereas slow-
responding variables such as ice volumes of glaciers and ice sheets respond with a substantial delay and due 
to their inertia, the response depends on when a certain GWL is reached. This also applies to some extent for 
sea level rise where, for example, the contributions of melting glaciers and ice sheets depend on the pathway 
followed to reach a given GWL (Chapter 9.6.3.4).  </p>

<p>In addition to the lagged effect, the climate response at a given GWL may differ before and after a period of 
overshoot, for example in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (e.g. Palter et al. 2018). Finally, 
as assessed in IPCC SR15, there is a difference in the response even for temperature-related variables if a 
GWL is reached in a rapidly warming transient state or in an equilibrium state when the land-sea warming 
contrast is less pronounced (e.g. King et al. 2020). However, in this report GWLs are used in the context of 
projections for the 21st century when the climate response is mostly not in equilibrium and where projections 
for many variables are less dependent on the pathway than for projections beyond 2100 (Section 9.6.3.4). </p>

<h3>Key conclusions on assessments based on GWLs</h3>

<p>GWL-based projections can inform society and policymakers on how climate would change under GWLs 
consistent with the aims of the Paris Agreement (stabilization at 1.5°C/well below 2°C), as well as on the 
consequences of missing these aims and reaching GWLs of 3°C or 4°C by the end of the century. The AR6 
assessment shows that every bit of global warming matters and that changes in global warming of 0.5°C lead 
to statistically significant changes in mean climate and climate extremes on global scale and for large regions 
(Sections 4.6.2, 11.2.4, 11.3, 11.4, 11.6, 11.9; Figs 11.8, 11.9, Atlas, Interactive Atlas), as also assessed in 
the IPCC SR15.  </p>
