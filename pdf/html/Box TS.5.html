<p>The continued growth of atmospheric CO2 concentrations over the industrial era is unequivocally due to 
emissions from human activities. Ocean and land carbon sinks slow the rise of CO2 in the atmosphere. 
Projections show that while land and ocean sinks absorb more CO2 under high emissions scenarios than low 
emissions scenarios, the fraction of emissions removed from the atmosphere by natural sinks decreases with 
higher concentrations (high confidence). Projected ocean and land sinks show similar responses for a given 
scenario, but the land sink has a much higher inter-annual variability and wider model spread. The slowed 
growth rates of the carbon sinks projected for the second half of this century are linked to strengthening 
carbon–climate feedbacks and stabilization of atmospheric CO2 under medium-to-no-mitigation and high-
mitigation scenarios respectively. {5.2, 5.4} </p>

<p>Carbon sinks for anthropogenic CO2 are associated with mainly physical ocean and biospheric land processes 
that drive the exchange of carbon between multiple land, ocean and atmospheric reservoirs. These exchanges 
are driven by increasing atmospheric CO2, but modulated by changes in climate (Box TS.5, Figure 1 c,d). 
The Northern and Southern Hemispheres dominate the land and ocean sinks, respectively (Box TS.5, Figure 
1). Ocean circulation and thermodynamic processes also play a critical role in coupling the global carbon and 
energy (heat) cycles. There is high confidence that this ocean carbon–heat nexus is an important basis for one 
of the most important carbon–climate metrics, the transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions 
(TCRE) (TS.3.2.1) used to determine the remaining carbon budget. {5.1, 5.2, 5.5, 9.2, Cross-Chapter Box 5.3} </p>

<p>Based on multiple lines of evidence using interhemispheric gradients of CO2 concentrations, isotopes, and 
inventory data, it is unequivocal that the growth in CO2 in the atmosphere since 1750 (see TS.2.2) is due to 
the direct emissions from human activities. The combustion of fossil fuels and land-use change for the period 
1750–2019 resulted in the release of 700 ± 75 PgC (likely range, 1 PgC = 1015 g of carbon) to the 
atmosphere, of which about 41% ± 11% remains in the atmosphere today (high confidence). Of the total 
anthropogenic CO2 emissions, the combustion of fossil fuels was responsible for about 64% ± 15%, growing 
to an 86% ± 14% contribution over the past 10 years. The remainder resulted from land-use change. During 
the last decade (2010–2019), average annual anthropogenic CO2 emissions reached the highest levels in 
human history at 10.9 ± 0.9 PgC yr-1 (high confidence). Of these emissions, 46% accumulated in the 
atmosphere (5.1 ± 0.02 PgC yr-1), 23% (2.5 ± 0.6 PgC yr-1) was taken up by the ocean and 31% (3.4 ± 0.9 
PgC yr-1) was removed by terrestrial ecosystems (high confidence). {5.2.1, 5.2.2, 5.2.3}  </p>

<p>The ocean (high confidence) and land (medium confidence) sinks of CO2 have increased with anthropogenic 
emissions over the past six decades (Box TS.5, Figure 1). This coherence between emissions and the growth 
in ocean and land sinks has resulted in the airborne fraction of anthropogenic CO2 remaining at 44%±10% 
over the past 60 years (high confidence). Interannual and decadal variability of the ocean and land sinks 
indicate that they are sensitive to changes in the growth rate of emissions as well as climate variability, and 
therefore also sensitive to climate change (high confidence). {5.2.1}  </p>

<p>The land CO2 sink is driven by carbon uptake by vegetation, with large interannual variability, for example, 
linked to ENSO. Since the 1980s, carbon fertilization from rising atmospheric CO2 has increased the strength 
of the net land CO2 sink (medium confidence). During the historical period, the growth of the ocean sink has 
been primarily determined by the growth rate of atmospheric CO2. However, there is medium confidence that 
changes to physical and chemical processes in the ocean and in the land biosphere, which govern carbon 
feedbacks, are already modifying the characteristics of variability, particularly the seasonal cycle of CO2 in 
both the ocean and land. However, changes to the multi-decadal trends in the sinks have not yet been 
observed. {2.3.4, 3.6.1, 5.2.1, TS.2.3, TS.2.6}  </p>

<p>In AR6, ESM projections are assessed with CO2 concentrations by 2100 from about 400 ppm (SSP1-1.9) to 
above 1100 ppm (SSP5-8.5). Most simulations are performed with prescribed atmospheric CO2 
concentrations, which already account for a central estimate of climate–carbon feedback effects. CO2 
emissions-driven simulations account for uncertainty in these feedbacks, but do not significantly change the 
projected global surface temperature changes (high confidence). Although land and ocean sinks absorb more 
CO2 under high emissions than low emissions scenarios, the fraction of emissions removed from the 
atmosphere decreases (high confidence). This means that the more CO2 that is emitted, the less efficient the 
ocean and land sinks become (high confidence), an effect which compensates for the logarithmic relationship 
between CO2 and its radiative forcing, which means that for each unit increase in additional atmospheric CO2 
the effect on global temperature decreases. (Box TS.5, Figure 1f,g). {4.3.1, 5.4.5, 5.5.1.2} </p>

<p>Ocean and land sinks show similar responses for a given scenario, but the land sink has a much higher inter-
annual variability and wider model spread. Under SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, the initial growth of both sinks in 
response to increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO2 is subsequently limited by emerging carbon–
climate feedbacks (high confidence) (Box TS.5, Figure 1f). Projections show that the ocean and land sinks 
will stop growing from the second part of the 21st century under all emissions scenarios, but with different 
drivers for different emissions scenarios. Under SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, the weakening growth rate of the 
ocean CO2 sink in the second half of the century is primarily linked to the strengthening positive feedback 
from reduced carbonate buffering capacity, ocean warming and altered ocean circulation (e.g., AMOC 
changes). In contrast, for SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5, the weakening growth rate of the ocean carbon 
sink is a response to the stabilizing or declining atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Under high CO2 emissions 
scenarios, it is very likely that the land carbon sink will grow more slowly due to warming and drying from 
the mid 21st century, but it is very unlikely that it will switch from being a sink to a source before 2100. 
Climate change alone is expected to increase land carbon accumulation in the high latitudes (not including 
permafrost, which is assessed in TS2.5 and TS.3.2.2), but also to lead to a counteracting loss of land carbon 
in the tropics (medium confidence). ESM projections show that the overall uncertainty of atmospheric CO2 
by 2100 is still dominated by the emission pathway, but carbon–climate feedbacks (see TS.3.3.2) are 
important, with increasing uncertainties in high emissions pathways (Box TS.5, Figure 1e). {4.3.2, 5.4.1, 
5.4.2, 5.4.4, 5.4.5, 11.6, 11.9, Cross-Chapter Box 5.1, Cross-Chapter Box 5.3, TS.3.3.2} </p>

<p>Under three SSP scenarios with long-term extensions until 2300 (SSP5-8.5, SSP5-3.4-OS, SSP1-2.6), ESMs 
project a change of the land from a sink to a source (medium confidence). The scenarios make simplified 
assumptions about emissions reductions, with SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-3.4-OS reaching about 400 ppm by 2300, 
while SSP5-8.5 exceeds 2000 ppm. Under high emissions the transition is warming-driven, whereas it is 
linked to the decline in atmospheric CO2 under net negative CO2 emissions. The ocean remains a sink 
throughout the period to 2300 except under very large net negative emissions. The response of the natural 
aspects of the carbon cycle to carbon dioxide removal is further developed in TS.3.3.2. {5.4.9, TS.3.3.2;
