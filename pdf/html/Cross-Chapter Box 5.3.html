<h3>Context</h3>

<p>In the past 60 years the ocean has taken up and stored 23 ± 5% of anthropogenic carbon emissions (medium 
confidence; Section 5.2.1.3) as well as more than 90% of the heat that has accumulated in the Earth system 
(referred to as excess heat) since the 1970s (Sections 7.2.2, 9.2.2, 9.2.3; Box 7.2;) (Frölicher et al., 2015; 
Talley et al., 2016; Gruber et al., 2019a; Hauck et al., 2020). The interplay between heat and CO2 uptake by 
the ocean has not only played a major role in slowing the rate of global warming but provides a first order 
influence in determining the unique properties of a metric of the coupled climate-carbon cycle response, 
transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE), which is critical to setting the future 
remaining carbon emissions budget (Sections 5.5.1.3, 5.5.4). This role of the ocean in the uptake of heat and 
anthropogenic CO2 and related feedbacks is what we term here the “Ocean Heat-Carbon Nexus”.  The ocean processes behind this nexus are important in shaping and understanding the near-linear relationship between 
cumulative CO2 emissions and global warming (TCRE) as well as the uncertainties in future projections of 
TCRE properties (Zickfeld et al., 2016; Bronselaer and Zanna, 2020; Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020), its path 
independence (MacDougall, 2017), and the warming commitment after cessation of greenhouse gas 
emissions (ZEC) (Zickfeld et al., 2016; Ehlert and Zickfeld, 2017; Section 5.5.2). In this box, we assess the 
role of the ocean and its physical and chemical thermodynamic processes that shape these striking 
characteristics. </p>

<p>The role of the ocean in setting the coupled climate-carbon cycle response is threefold: firstly, the ocean and 
land carbon sinks together set the airborne fraction (AF) of CO2 in the atmosphere, which sets the radiative 
forcing that drives the additional heat in the atmosphere most of which is taken up by the ocean (Katavouta 
et al., 2019; Williams et al., 2019; Sections 7.2, 9.2). However, the land carbon sink does not appear to play 
an important role in determining the linearity and path-independence of TCRE (Section 5.5.1.1; Goodwin et 
al., 2015; MacDougall and Friedlingstein, 2015; Ehlert et al., 2017). Secondly, the ocean sets the thermal 
response through ocean heat uptake (Section 9.2; Frölicher et al., 2015; Bronselaer and Zanna, 2020). 
Thirdly, there is a feedback within the ocean heat-carbon nexus as ocean warming, particularly under low or 
no mitigation scenarios weakens the ocean sink of CO2, which influences the AF, and hence the radiative 
forcing (Williams et al., 2019) (Box 7.1). The near-linear relationship between cumulative CO2 emissions 
and global warming (TCRE) is thought to arise to a large extent from the compensation between the 
decreasing ability of the ocean to take up heat and CO2 at higher cumulative CO2 emissions, pointing to 
similar processes that determine ocean uptake of heat and carbon (Goodwin et al., 2015; MacDougall and 
Friedlingstein, 2015; Williams et al., 2016; Zickfeld et al., 2016; Ehlert et al., 2017; Section 5.5.1.1). </p>

<h3>Processes the drive the Ocean Carbon - Heat Nexus and its change</h3>

<p>The air-sea flux of heat and all gases across the ocean interface is driven by a common set of complex and 
difficult to observe turbulent diffusion and mixing processes (Wanninkhof et al., 2009; Wanninkhof, 2014; 
Cronin et al., 2019; Watson et al., 2020; Sections 5.2.1.3; 9.2.1.2). These processes are typically simplified 
into widely verified expressions that link the flux to wind stress, the solubility and the gradient across the air-
sea interface (medium confidence). Because the ocean has a higher heat capacity than the atmosphere (heat 
capacity of the upper 100 m of the ocean is about 30 times larger than the heat capacity of the atmosphere), 
the partitioning of heat between the atmosphere and the ocean is primarily influenced by the temperature 
differences between air and seawater. Similarly, the unique seawater carbonate buffering capacity, enables 
CO2 to be stored in the ocean as dissolved salts, rather than just as dissolved gas, which increases the 
capacity of seawater to store CO2 by two orders of magnitude beyond the solubility of CO2 gas and 
approximate the partitioning ratio of heat between the atmosphere and the ocean (Zeebe and Wolf-Gladrow, 
2009; Bronselaer and Zanna, 2020; Section 9.2.2.1). The role of the biological carbon pump in influencing 
the ocean sink of anthropogenic carbon into the ocean interior is assessed to be minimal during the historical 
period but this may change, particularly in regional contexts, by 2100 (medium confidence) (Laufkötter et al., 
2015; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). Its role is important in the natural or pre-industrial carbon cycle (medium 
confidence) (Henson et al., 2016).   </p>

<p>Under climate change, the buffering capacity of the ocean decreases (increasing Revelle Factor), which 
reflects a decreasing capacity for the ocean to take up additional anthropogenic CO2 and store it in the DIC 
reservoir (Egleston et al., 2010). In contrast to CO2, there is no physical limitation that would reduce the 
ability of surface ocean temperature to equilibrate with the atmospheric temperature. However, both carbon 
and heat fluxes depend on air-sea heat fluxes that depend on gradients of characteristics at the air-sea 
interface. These gradients at the air-sea interface respond to ocean dynamics, such as the volume of the 
surface mixed-layer that equilibrates with the atmosphere, and ocean circulation that can flush the surface 
layer with water-masses that have not equilibrated with the atmosphere for a long time. Limited recent 
evidence has suggested that the effect of small-scale dynamics absent in climate and earth system models 
might be locally important in this regard (Bachman and Klocker, 2020). In summary, changes in heat and 
carbon uptake by the ocean rely on a combination of unique chemical and shared physical processes any of 
which have the potential to disrupt the coherence of heat and CO2 change in the ocean.  </p>

<h3>Spatial pattern of air-sea fluxes and storage</h3>

<p>Large scale regional and global ocean circulation shape the spatial pattern of the uptake and storage of both 
CO2 and heat (see Figure 5.8 for carbon; Figure 9.6 for heat observations; Section 9.2; (Frölicher et al., 2015; 
Bronselaer and Zanna, 2020). This coherence of spatial patterns driven by the large-scale ocean circulation 
has three aspects: firstly, notwithstanding interannual - decadal variability in heat and CO2 uptake, there is a 
spatial coherence of the temporally integrated uptake at the air-sea boundary, particularly in the Southern 
Ocean (Cross-Chapter Box 5.3, Figure 1; Talley et al., 2016; Keppler and Landschützer, 2019; Auger et al., 
2021). Secondly, the importance of the meridional overturning circulation in the subsequent storage of both 
heat and CO2 in mode, intermediate and deep waters of the ocean interior (Section 9.2). Of particular note 
are the roles of the North Atlantic Ocean (Section 9.2.3.1) and the Southern Ocean (Section 9.2.3.2) in 
linking the spatial pattern of air-sea fluxes, the storage of heat and carbon, and ultimately in understanding 
and predicting the sensitivity of the carbon – heat nexus to climate change (Frölicher et al., 2015; Thomas et 
al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019). </p>

<p><figref>Cross-Chapter Box 5.3,Figure1</figref></p>

<p>The role of the large-scale circulation in shaping these fluxes is to (i) flush the ocean surface layer with deep 
waters that are relatively cold and with weak or no anthropogenic CO2 and heat content because they have 
been isolated from the atmosphere for centuries, and (ii) transport the anthropogenic CO2 and heat at depth, 
away from the atmosphere (Frölicher et al., 2015; Marshall et al., 2015; Armour et al., 2016). For instance, in 
the Southern Ocean upwelled water-masses uptake large amount of anthropogenic CO2 and heat (Cross-
Chapter Box 5.3, Figure 1), which are then exported northward by the circulation to be stored at depth in the 
Southern Hemisphere subtropical gyres (Cross-Chapter Box 5.3, Figure 1; Figure 9.7). In the North Atlantic, 
the signature of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is also clearly visible, with large 
amounts of heat and carbon being stored beneath the North Atlantic subtropical gyre at 1 km depth (Cross-
Chapter Box 5.3, Figure 1). In summary, the net air-sea fluxes of anthropogenic CO2 and heat depend on 
large-scale circulation, which is associated with upper ocean stratification, mixed-layer depth, and water-
mass formation, transport and mixing (Sections 9.1; 9.2; 9.3).  </p>

<h3>Changes in ocean processes and impact on the ocean carbon-heat nexus</h3>

<p>Future projections of the ocean carbon-heat nexus in the second half of the 21st century, particularly those 
under weak or no mitigation scenarios, are characterized by the strengthening of the two largest positive 
feedbacks: weakening surface ocean CO2  buffering capacity (increasing Revelle Factor) and warming that 
further reduces CO2 solubility and strengthens ocean stratification, which reduces exchange between the 
ocean surface and interior (Jiang et al., 2019; Bronselaer and Zanna, 2020). These are offset by a growing 
but scenario-dependent negative feedback from increasing carbon and heat air sea fluxes towards the ocean, 
due to increased atmospheric temperature and CO2 concentrations (Talley et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2019; 
McKinley et al., 2020). The Southern Ocean (SO) in particular is one of the regions where the projected 
feedback can be largest and where inter-model differences are strongest (Roy et al., 2011; Frölicher et al., 
2015; Hewitt et al., 2016; Mongwe et al., 2018). These projected trends in ocean carbonate chemistry (5.4.2), 
together with surface ocean warming (Section 9.2.1.1), explain the slow down and long-term reduction of the 
ocean sink for anthropogenic CO2 even as emissions continue to rise beyond 2050 under weak to no 
mitigation scenarios (Section 5.4: Figure 5.25; Technical Summary TS Box 7 and Figure 2.7.1).  Projected 
change in the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean overturning circulation also impact air-sea fluxes of heat 
and carbon. The very likely decline in AMOC in the 21st century for all shared socioeconomic pathways 
(SSP) scenarios (Section 9.2.3.1) tends to reduce heat and carbon uptake translating in a positive feedback. 
In contrast, in the Southern Ocean, the future 21st century projected increase in upper ocean overturning 
circulation (low confidence) due to increasing wind forcing projected for all scenarios, except those with 
large mitigation (SSP1–2.6), translate in a negative feedback with increasing heat and carbon uptake and 
storage despite the increasing stratification and outgassing of natural CO2 in the upwelling zone (Sections 
9.2.3.2; 5.2.1.3).  </p>

<p>In summary, a combination of unique chemical properties of seawater carbonate combined with shared 
physical ocean processes explain the coherence and scaling in the uptake and storage of both CO2 and heat in 
the ocean, which is the basis for the carbon-heat nexus (high confidence). In this way the processes of the 
ocean carbon – heat nexus help understand the quasi-linear and path independence of properties of TCRE, 
which forms the basis for the ZEC (Section 5.5) (medium confidence).  Future projections under low or no 
mitigation indicate with high confidence that carbon chemistry and warming will strengthen the positive 
feedback to climate change by reducing ocean carbon uptake, and medium confidence that ocean circulation 
may partially compensate that positive feedback by slightly increasing anthropogenic carbon storage. 
Increasing ocean warming and stratification may decrease exchanges between the surface and subsurface 
ocean, which could reduce the path independence of TCRE, though this effect can be partially 
counterbalanced regionally by increasing circulation associated with increasing winds (low confidence). </p>
