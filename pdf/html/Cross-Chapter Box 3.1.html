<p>AR5 found that the rate of global mean surface temperature (GMST) increase inferred from observations 
over the 1998-2012 period was lower than the rate of increase over the 1951-2012 period, and lower than the 
ensemble mean increase in historical simulations from CMIP5 climate models extended by RCP scenario 
simulations beyond 2005 (Flato et al., 2013). This apparent slowdown of surface global warming compared 
to the 62-year rate was assessed with medium confidence to have been caused in roughly equal measure by a 
cooling contribution from internal variability and a reduced trend in external forcing (particularly associated 
with solar and volcanic forcing) in the AR5 based on expert judgement (Flato et al., 2013). In AR5 it was 
assessed that almost all CMIP5 simulations did not reproduce the observed slower warming, and that there 
was medium confidence that the trend difference from the CMIP5 ensemble mean was to a substantial degree 
caused by internal variability with possible contributions from forcing error and model response uncertainty. 
This Cross-Chapter Box assesses new findings from observational products and statistical and physical 
models on trends over the 1998-2012 period considered in AR5. </p>

<h3>Updated observational and reanalyses data sets and comparison with model simulations</h3>

<p>Since the AR5, there have been version updates and new releases of most observational GMST data sets 
(Cross-Chapter Box 2.3). All the updated products now available consistently find stronger positive trends 
for 1998-2012 than those assessed in AR5 (Cowtan and Way, 2014; Karl et al., 2015; Hausfather et al., 
2017; Medhaug et al., 2017; Simmons et al., 2017; Risbey et al., 2018). Simmons et al. (2017) reported that 
the 1998-2012 GMST trends in the updated observational and reanalysis data sets available at that time range 
from 0.06 °C to 0.14°C per decade, compared with the 0.05 °C per decade on average as reported in AR5, 
whilst the latest data products reported in Chapter 2 Table 2.4 show GMST or global mean near-surface air 
temperature (GSAT) trends over that period ranging from 0.12°C to 0.14°C per decade. The lowest trend in 
Simmons et al. (2017) is from HadCRUT4, now superseded by HadCRUT5, which shows a trend of 0.12 ºC 
per decade. The upward revision is mainly due to improved sea surface temperature (SST) data sets and 
infilling of surface temperature in locations with missing records in observational products, mainly in the 
Arctic (see Cross-Chapter Box 2.3 for details).  </p>

<p>With these updates, all the observed trends assessed here lie within the 10th-90th percentile range of the 
simulated trends in the CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulations (Cross-Chapter Box 3.1, Figure 1a). This result is 
insensitive to whether model GSAT (based on surface air temperature) or GMST (based on a blend of 
surface air temperature over land and sea ice and SST over open ocean) is used, and to whether or not 
masking with the observational data coverage is applied. Therefore, the observed 1998-2012 trend is 
consistent with both the CMIP5 or CMIP6 multi-model ensemble of trends over the same period (high 
confidence). </p>

<h3>Internal variability</h3>

<p>All the observation-based GMST and GSAT trends are lower than the multi-model mean GMST and GSAT 
trends of both CMIP5 and CMIP6 for 1998-2012 (Cross-Chapter Box 3.1, Figure 1a). This suggests a 
possible cooling contribution from internal variability during this period. This is supported by initialized 
decadal hindcasts, which account for the phase of the multidecadal modes of variability (Sections 3.7.6 and 
3.7.7), and which better reproduce observed global mean SST and GSAT trends than uninitialized historical 
simulations (Guemas et al., 2013; Meehl et al., 2014).  </p>

<p>Studies since AR5 identify Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV) as the leading mode of variability associated 
with unforced decadal GSAT fluctuations, with additional influence from Atlantic Multidecadal Variability 
(Brown et al., 2015; Dai et al., 2015; Steinman et al., 2015; Pasini et al., 2017; Annex IV.2.6, IV.2.7). PDV 
transitioned from positive (El Niño-like) to negative (La Niña-like) phases during the slow warming period 
(Figure 3.39f, Cross-Chapter Box 3.1, Figure 1c). Model ensemble members that capture the observed 
slower decadal warming under transient forcing, and time segments of model simulations that show decadal 
GSAT decreases under fixed radiative forcing, also feature negative PDV trends (Maher et al., 2014; Meehl 
et al., 2011, 2013, 2014; Middlemas and Clement, 2016; Cross-Chapter Box 3.1, Figure 1d), suggesting the 
influence of PDV. This is confirmed by statistical models with the PDV-GSAT relationship estimated from 
observations and model simulations (Schmidt et al., 2014; Meehl et al., 2016b; Hu and Fedorov, 2017), 
selected ensemble members and time segments from model simulations where PDV by chance evolves in 
phase with observations over the slow warming period (Huber and Knutti, 2014; Risbey et al., 2014), and 
coupled model experiments in which PDV evolution is constrained to follow the observations (Kosaka and 
Xie, 2013, 2016; England et al., 2014; Watanabe et al., 2014; Delworth et al., 2015). Part of the PDV trend 
may be driven by anthropogenic aerosols (Smith et al., 2016); however, this result is model-dependent, and 
internally-driven PDV dominates the forced PDV signal in the CMIP6 multi-model ensemble (Section 
3.7.6). It is also notable that there is large uncertainty in the magnitude of the PDV influence on GSAT 
across models (Deser et al., 2017a; Wang et al., 2017a) and among the studies cited above. In addition to 
PDV, contributions to the reduced warming trend from wintertime Northern Hemisphere atmospheric 
internal variability, particularly associated with a trend towards the negative phase of the Northern Annular 
Mode/North Atlantic Oscillation (Annex IV.2.1; Guan et al., 2015; Saffioti et al., 2015; Iles and Hegerl, 
2017) or the Cold Ocean-Warm Land pattern (Molteni et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2020) have been suggested, 
leading to regional continental cooling over a large part of Eurasia and North America (Li et al., 2015; Deser 
et al., 2017; Gan et al., 2019; Cross-Chapter Box 3.1, Figure 1c).  </p>

<p>Such internally-driven variation of decadal GSAT trends is not unique to the 1998-2012 period (Section 
1.4.2.1; Lovejoy, 2014; Roberts et al., 2015; Dai and Bloecker, 2019). Due to the nature of internal 
variability, surface temperature changes over the 1998-2012 period are regionally- and seasonally-varying 
(Trenberth et al., 2014; Zang et al., 2019; Cross-Chapter Box 3.1, Figure 1c). Further, there was no 
slowdown in the increasing occurrence of hot extremes over land (Seneviratne et al., 2014). Thus, the 
internally-driven slowdown of GSAT increase does not correspond to slowdown of warming everywhere on 
the Earth’s surface. </p>

<h3>Updated forcing</h3>

<p>CMIP5 historical simulations driven by observed forcing variations ended in 2005 and were extended with 
RCP scenario simulations for model-observation comparisons beyond that date. Post AR5 studies based on 
updated external forcing show that while no net effect of updated anthropogenic aerosols is found on GSAT 
trends (Murphy, 2013; Gettelman et al., 2015; Oudar et al., 2018), natural forcing by moderate volcanic 
eruptions in the 21st century (Haywood et al., 2014; Ridley et al., 2014; Santer et al., 2014) and a prolonged 
solar irradiance minimum around 2009 compared to the normal 11-year cycle (Lean, 2018) yield a negative 
contribution to radiative forcing, which was missing in CMIP5 (Figure 2.2). This explains part of the 
difference between observed and CMIP5 trends, as shown based on EMIC simulations (Huber and Knutti, 
2014; Ridley et al., 2014), statistical and mathematical models (Schmidt et al., 2014; Lean, 2018), and 
process-based climate models (Santer et al., 2014). However, in a single climate model study by Thorne et 
al. (2015), updating most forcings (greenhouse gas concentrations, solar irradiance, and volcanic and 
anthropogenic aerosols) available when the study was done makes no significant difference to the 1998-2012 
GMST trend from that obtained with original CMIP5 forcing. Potential underestimation of volcanic 
(negative) forcing may have played a role (Outten et al., 2015). In the multi-model ensemble mean, the 
1998-2012 GMST trends are almost equal in CMIP5 and CMIP6 (Cross-Chapter Box 3.1, Figure 1a), 
suggesting compensation by a higher transient climate response and equilibrium climate sensitivity in 
CMIP6 than CMIP5 (Section 7.5.6). To summarize, while there is medium confidence that natural forcing 
that was missing in CMIP5 contributed to the difference of observed and simulated GMST trends, 
confidence remains low in the quantitative contribution of net forcing updates. </p>

<h3>Energy budget and heat redistribution</h3>

<p>The early 21st century slower warming was observed in atmospheric temperatures, but the heat capacity of 
the atmosphere is very small compared to that of the ocean. Although there is noticeable uncertainty among 
observational products (Su et al., 2017a) and observation quality changes through time, global ocean heat 
content continued to increase during the slower surface warming period (very high confidence), at a rate 
consistent with CMIP5 and CMIP6 historical simulations (Sections 2.3.3.1, 3.5.1.3 and 7.2.2.2). There is 
high confidence that the Earth’s energy imbalance was larger in the 2000s than in the 1985-1999 period 
(Section 7.2.2.1), consistent with accelerating ocean heat uptake in the past two decades (Section 3.5.1.3). 
Internal decadal variability is mainly associated with redistribution of heat within the climate system (Yan et 
al., 2016c; Drijfhout, 2018) while associated top of the atmosphere radiation anomalies are weak (Palmer 
and McNeall, 2014). Heat redistribution in the top 350 m of the Indian and Pacific Oceans has been found to 
be the main contributor to reduced surface warming during the slower surface warming period (Lee et al., 
2015; Nieves et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2016a), consistent with the simulated signature of PDV (England et al., 
2014; Maher et al., 2018a; Gastineau et al., 2019). Below 700 m, enhanced heat uptake over the slower 
surface warming period is observed mainly in the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean (Chen and Tung, 
2014), though whether this is a response to forcing or a unique signature of the slow GMST warming has 
been questioned (Liu et al., 2016b).  </p>

<h3>Summary and implications</h3>

<p>With updated observation-based GMST data sets and forcing, improved analysis methods, new modelling 
evidence and deeper understanding of mechanisms, there is very high confidence that the slower GMST and 
GSAT increase inferred from observations in the 1998-2012 period was a temporary event induced by 
internal and naturally-forced variability that partly offset the anthropogenic warming trend over this period. 
Global ocean heat content continued to increase throughout this period, and the slowdown was only evident 
in the atmosphere and at the surface (very high confidence). Considering all the sources of uncertainties, it is 
impossible to robustly identify a single cause of the early 2000s slowdown (Hedemann et al., 2017; Power et al., 2017); rather, it should be interpreted as due to a combination of several factors (Huber and Knutti, 2014; 
Schmidt et al., 2014; Medhaug et al., 2017).  </p>

<p>A major El Niño event in 2014-2016 led to three consecutive years of record annual GMST with unusually 
strong heat release from the Northwestern Pacific Ocean (Yin et al., 2018), which marked the end of the 
slower warming period (Hu and Fedorov, 2017; Su et al., 2017b; Cha et al., 2018). The past 5-year period 
(2016-2020) is the hottest 5-year period in the instrumental record up to 2020 (high confidence). This rapid 
warming was accompanied by a PDV shift toward its positive phase (Su et al., 2017b; Cha et al., 2018). A 
higher rate of warming following the 1998-2012 period is consistent with the predictions in AR5 Box 9.2 
(Flato et al., 2013) and with a statistical prediction system (Sévellec and Drijfhout, 2018). Initialized decadal 
predictions show higher GMST trends in the early 2020s compared to uninitialized simulations (Thoma et 
al., 2015; Meehl et al., 2016c).  </p>

<p>While some recent studies find that internal decadal GSAT variability may become weaker under GSAT 
warming, associated in part with reduced amplitude PDV (Section 4.5.3.5; Brown et al., 2017), the 
weakening is small under a realistic range of warming. A large volcanic eruption would temporarily cool 
GSAT (Cross-Chapter Box 4.1). Thus, there is very high confidence that reduced and increased GMST and 
GSAT trends at decadal timescales will continue to occur in the 21st century (Meehl et al., 2013; Roberts et 
al., 2015; Medhaug and Drange, 2016). However, such internal or volcanically forced decadal variations in 
GSAT trend have little affect on the centennial warming (England et al., 2015; Cross-Chapter Box 4.1). </p>
