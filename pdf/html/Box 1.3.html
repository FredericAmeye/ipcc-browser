<p>Emission metrics compare the radiative forcing, temperature change, or other climate effects arising from 
emissions of CO2 versus those from emissions of non-CO2 radiative forcing agents (such as CH4 or N2O). 
They have been discussed in the IPCC since the First Assessment Report and are used as a means of 
aggregating emissions and removals of different gases and placing them on a common (‘CO2 equivalent’, or 
‘CO2-eq’) scale. </p>

<p>AR5 included a thorough assessment of common pulse emission metrics, and how these address various 
indicators of future climate change (Myhre et al., 2013). Most prominently used are the Global Warming 
Potentials (GWPs), which integrate the calculated radiative forcing contribution following an idealized pulse 
(or one-time) emission, over a chosen time horizon (IPCC, 1990a), or the Global Temperature-change 
Potential (GTP), which considers the contribution of emission to the global-mean temperature at a specific 
time after emission. Yet another metric is the Global Precipitation change Potential (GPP), used to quantify 
the precipitation change per unit mass of emission of a given forcing agent (Shine et al., 2015).  </p>

<p>As an example of usage, the Paris Rulebook [Decision 18/CMA.1, annex, paragraph 37] states that ‘Each 
Party shall use the 100-year time-horizon global warming potential (GWP) values from the IPCC Fifth 
Assessment Report, or 100-year time-horizon GWP values from a subsequent IPCC assessment report as 
agreed upon by the ‘Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement’ 
(CMA), to report aggregate emissions and removals of GHGs, expressed in CO2-eq. Each Party may in 
addition also use other metrics (e.g., global temperature potential) to report supplemental information on 
aggregate emissions and removals of GHGs, expressed in CO2-eq’. </p>

<p>Since AR5, improved knowledge of the radiative properties, lifetimes, and other characteristics of emitted 
species, and the response of the climate system, have led to updates to the numerical values of a range of 
metrics; see Chapter 7, Table 7.15. Another key development is a set of metrics that compare a pulse 
emission of CO2 (as considered by GWP and GTP) to step-changes of emission rates for short-lived 
components (i.e., also considering emission trends). Termed GWP* (which also includes a pulse component) 
and Combined Global Temperature change Potential (CGTP), these metrics allow the construction of a near-
linear relationship between global surface temperature change and cumulative CO2 and CO2-equivalent 
emissions of both short and long lived forcing agents (Allen et al., 2016; Cain et al., 2019; Collins et al., 
2019). For example, the temperature response to a sustained methane reduction has a similar behaviour to the 
temperature response to a pulse CO2 removal (or avoided emission). </p>

<p>In this Report, recent scientific developments underlying emission metrics, as relevant for Working Group I, 
are assessed in full in Chapter 7, Section 7.6. In particular, see Box 7.3, which discusses the choice of metric 
for different usages, and Section 7.6.1, which treats the challenge of comparing the climate implication of 
emissions of short-lived and long-lived compounds. Also, the choice of metric is of key importance when 
defining and quantifying net zeronet-zero greenhouse gas emissions; see Box 1.4 and Chapter 7, Section 
7.6.2. Chapter 6 applies metrics to attribute GSAT change to short-lived climate forcer (SLCF) and long-
lived greenhouse gas (LLGHG) emissions from different sectors and regions (Section 6.6.2). </p>

<p>The metrics assessed in this Report are also used, and separately assessed, by Working Group III. See Cross-
Chapter Box 2: GHG emissions metrics and Annex B in Chapter 2 of the WGIII contribution to the AR6. </p>
