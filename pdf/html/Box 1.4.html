<p>Article 4 of the Paris Agreement sets an objective to ‘achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by 
sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases’ (Section 1.2). This box addresses the relationship 
between such a balance and the corresponding evolution of global surface temperature, with or without the 
deployment of large-scale Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR), using the definitions of ‘net zero CO2 
emissions’ and ‘net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions’ of the AR6 Glossary (Annex VII: Glossary).  </p>

<p>‘Net zero CO2 emissions’ is defined in AR6 as the condition in which anthropogenic CO2 emissions are 
balanced by anthropogenic CO2 removals over a specified period. Similarly, ‘net zero GHG emissions’ is the 
condition in which metric-weighted anthropogenic GHG emissions are balanced by metric-weighted 
anthropogenic GHG removals over a specified period. The quantification of net zero GHG emissions thus 
depends on the GHG emission metric chosen to compare emissions of different gases, as well as the time 
horizon chosen for that metric. (For a broader discussion of metrics, see Box 1.3 and Chapter 7, Section 7.6, 
and WGIII Cross-Chapter Box 2.)  </p>

<p>Technical notes expanding on these definitions can be found as part of their respective entries in the Annex 
VII: Glossary. The notes clarify the relation between ‘net zero’ CO2 and GHG emissions and the concept of 
carbon and GHG neutrality, and the metric usage set out in the Paris Rulebook (Decision 18/CMA.1, annex, 
paragraph 37).  </p>

<p>A global net zero level of CO2, or GHG, emissions will be achieved when the sum of anthropogenic 
emissions and removals across all countries, sectors, sources and sinks reaches zero. Achieving net zero CO2 
or GHG emissions globally, at a given time, does not imply that individual entities (i.e., countries, sectors) 
have to reach net zero emissions at that same point in time, or even at all (see WGIII, TS Box 4 and Chapter 
3). </p>

<p>Net zero CO2 and net zero GHG emissions differ in their implications for the subsequent evolution of global 
surface temperature. Net zero CO2 emissions result in approximately stable CO2-induced warming, but 
overall warming will depend on any further warming contribution of non-CO2 GHGs. The effect of net zero 
GHG emissions on global surface temperature depends on the GHG emission metric chosen to aggregate 
emissions and removals of different gases. For GWP100 (the metric in which Parties to the Paris Agreement 
have decided to report their aggregated emissions and removals), net zero GHG emissions would generally 
imply a peak in global surface temperature, followed by a gradual decline (Chapter 7, Section 7.6.2; see also Chapter 4, Section 4.7.1 regarding the Zero Emission Commitment). However, other anthropogenic factors, 
such as aerosol emissions or land use-induced changes in albedo, may still affect the climate. </p>

<p>The definitions of net zero CO2 and GHG should also be seen in relation to the various CDR methods 
discussed in the context of climate change mitigation (see Chapter 5, Section 5.6, which also includes an 
assessment of the response of natural sinks to CDR), and how it is employed in scenarios used throughout 
the WG I and III reports, as described in Section 1.6.1. (See also WGIII, Chapters 3, 7 and 12.) </p>

<p>For virtually all scenarios assessed by the IPCC, CDR is necessary to reach both global net zero CO2 and net 
zero GHG emissions, to compensate for residual anthropogenic emissions. This is in part because for some 
sources of CO2 and non-CO2 emissions, abatement options to eliminate them have not yet been identified. 
For a given scenario, the choice of GHG metric determines how much net CDR is necessary to compensate 
for residual non-CO2 emissions, in order to reach net zero GHG emissions (Chapter 7, Section 7.6.2).  </p>

<p>If CDR is further used to go beyond net zero, to a situation with net-negative CO2 emissions (i.e., where 
anthropogenic removals exceed anthropogenic emissions), anthropogenic CO2-induced warming will 
decline. A further increase of CDR, until a situation with net zero or even net-negative GHG emissions is 
reached, would increase the pace at which historical human-induced warming is reversed after its peak 
(SR1.5, IPCC, 2018). Net-negative anthropogenic GHG emissions may become necessary to stabilize the 
global surface temperature in the long term, should climate feedbacks further affect natural GHG sinks and 
sources (see Chapter 5).  </p>

<p>CDR can be achieved through a number of measures (Chapter 5, Section 5.6, and SRCCL). These include 
additional afforestation, reforestation, soil carbon management, biochar, direct air capture and carbon capture 
and storage (DACCS), and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) (de Coninck et al., 2018, 
SR1.5 Ch4; Minx et al., 2018; see also WGIII Chapters 7 and 12). Differences between Land Use, Land Use 
Change and Forestry (LULUCF) accounting rules, and scientific book-keeping approaches for CO2 
emissions and removals from the terrestrial biosphere, can result in significant differences between the 
amount of CDR that is reported in different studies (Grassi et al., 2017). Different measures to achieve CDR 
come with different risks, negative side effects and potential co-benefits – also in conjunction with 
sustainable development goals – that can inform choices around their implementation (Fuss et al., 2018; Roe 
et al., 2019, Chapter 5, Section 5.6). Technologies to achieve direct large-scale anthropogenic removals of 
non-CO2 GHGs are speculative at present (Yoon et al., 2009; Ming et al., 2016; Kroeger et al., 2017; Jackson 
et al., 2019).  </p>
