<p>Examining extremes in pre-instrumental information can help to put events occurring in the instrumental 
record (referred to as ‘observed’) in a longer-term context. This box focuses on extremes in the Common Era 
(CE, the last 2000 years), because there is generally higher confidence in pre-instrumental information 
gathered from the more recent archives from the Common Era than from earlier evidence. It addresses 
evidence of extreme events in paleo reconstructions, documentary evidence (such as grape harvest data, 
religious documents, newspapers, and logbooks) and model-based analyses, and whether observed extremes have or have not been exceeded in the Common Era. This box provides overviews of i) AR5 assessments 
and ii) types of evidence assessed here, evidence of iii) droughts, iv) temperature extremes, v) paleofloods, 
and vi) paleotempests, and vii) a summary.  </p>

<p>AR5 (Chapter 5, Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013) concluded with high confidence that droughts of greater 
magnitude and of longer duration than those observed in the instrumental period occurred in many regions 
during the preceding millennium. There was high confidence in evidence that floods during the past five 
centuries in northern and Central Europe, the western Mediterranean region, and eastern Asia were of a 
greater magnitude than those observed instrumentally, and medium confidence in evidence that floods in the 
near East, India and central North America were comparable to modern observed floods. While AR5 
assessed 20th century summer temperatures compared to those reconstructed in the Common Era, it did not 
assess shorter duration temperature extremes. </p>

<p>Many factors affect confidence in information on pre-instrumental extremes. First, the geographical coverage 
of paleoclimate reconstructions of extremes is not spatially uniform (Smerdon and Pollack, 2016) and 
depends on both the availability of archives and records, which are environmentally dependent, and also the 
differing attention and focus from the scientific community. In Australia, for example, the paleoclimate 
network is sparser than for other regions, such as Asia, Europe and North America, and synthesised products 
rely on remote proxies and assumptions about the spatial coherence of precipitation between remote climates 
(Cook et al., 2016c; Freund et al., 2017). Second, pre-instrumental evidence of extremes may be focused on 
understanding archetypal extreme events, such as the climatic consequences of the 1815 eruption of Mount 
Tambora, Indonesia (Brohan et al., 2016; Veale and Endfield, 2016). These studies provide narrow evidence 
of extremes in response to specific forcings (Li, 2017) for specific epochs. Third, natural archives may 
provide information about extremes in one season only and may not represent all extremes of the same types.  </p>

<p>Evidence of shorter duration extreme event types, such as floods and tropical storms, is further restricted by 
the comparatively low chronological controls and temporal resolution (e.g., monthly, seasonal, yearly, 
multiple years) of most archives compared to the events (e.g., minutes to days). Natural archives may be 
sensitive only to intense environmental disturbances, and so only sporadically record short-duration or small 
spatial scale extremes. Interpreting sedimentary records as evidence of past short-duration extremes is also 
complex and requires a clear understanding of natural processes. For example, paleoflood reconstructions of 
flood recurrence and intensity produced from geological evidence (e.g., river and lake sediments), 
speleothems (Denniston and Luetscher, 2017), botanical evidence (e.g., flood damage to trees, or tree ring 
reconstructions), and floral and faunal evidence (e.g., diatom fossil assemblages) require understanding of 
sediment sources and flood mechanisms. Pre-instrumental records of tropical storm intensity and frequency 
(also called paleotempest records) derived from overwash deposits of coastal lake and marsh sediments are 
difficult to interpret. Many factors impact whether disturbances are deposited in archives (Muller et al., 
2017) and deposits may provide sporadic and incomplete preservation histories (e.g., Tamura et al., 2018).  </p>

<p>Overall, the most complete pre-instrumental evidence of extremes occurs for long-duration, large-spatial-
scale extremes, such as for multi-year meteorological droughts or seasonal- and regional-scale temperature 
extremes. Additionally, more precise insights into recent extremes emerge where multiple studies have been 
undertaken, compared to the confidence in extremes reported at single sites or in single studies, which may 
not necessarily be representative of large-scale changes, or for reconstructions that synthesise multiple 
proxies over large areas (e.g., drought atlases). Multiproxy synthesis products combine paleoclimate 
temperature reconstructions and cover sub-continental- to hemispheric-scale regions to provide continuous 
records of the Common Era (e.g. Ahmed et al., 2013; Neukom et al., 2014 for temperature). </p>

<p>There is high confidence in the occurrence of long-duration and severe drought events during the Common 
Era for many locations, although their severity compared to recent drought events differs between locations 
and the lengths of reconstruction provided. Recent observed drought extremes in some regions (such as the 
Levant (Cook et al., 2016a), California in the United States (Cook et al., 2014;  Griffin and Anchukaitis, 
2014), and the Andes (Domínguez-Castro et al., 2018)) do not have precedents within the multi-century 
periods reconstructed in these studies, in terms of duration and/or severity. In some regions (in Southwest 
North America (Asmerom et al., 2013; Cook et al., 2015), the Great Plains region (Cook et al., 2004), the 
Middle East (Kaniewski et al., 2012), and China (Gou et al., 2015), recent drought extremes may have been 
exceeded in the Common Era. In further locations, there is conflicting evidence for the severity of pre-
instrumental droughts compared to observed extremes, depending on the length of the reconstruction and the 
seasonal perspective provided (see Cook et al., 2016b; Freund et al., 2017 for Australia). There can also be 
differing conclusions for the severity, or even the occurrence, of specific individual pre-instrumental 
droughts when different evidence is compared (e.g., Büntgen et al., 2015; Wetter et al., 2014).  </p>

<p>There is medium confidence that the magnitude of large-scale, seasonal-scale extreme high temperatures in 
observed records exceed those reconstructed over the Common Era in some locations, such as Central 
Europe. In one example, multiple studies have examined the unusualness of present-day European summer 
temperature records in a long-term context, particularly in comparison to the exceptionally warm year of 
1540 CE in Central Europe. Several studies indicate recent extreme summers (2003 and 2010) in Europe 
have been unusually warm in the context of the last 500 years (Barriopedro et al., 2011; Wetter and Pfister, 
2013; Wetter et al., 2014; Orth et al., 2016a), or longer (Luterbacher et al., 2016). Others studies show 
summer temperatures in Central Europe in 1540 were warmer than the present-day (1966–2015) mean, but 
note that it is difficult to assess whether or not the 1540 summer was for its part warmer than observed 
record extreme temperatures (Orth et al., 2016a).  </p>

<p>There is high confidence that the magnitude of floods over the Common Era has exceeded observed records 
in some locations, including Central Europe and eastern Asia. Recent literature supports the AR5 
assessments (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013) of floods. High temporally resolved records provide evidence, 
for example, of Common Era floods exceeding the probable maximum flood levels in the Upper Colorado 
River, USA (Greenbaum et al., 2014) and peak discharges that are double gauge levels along the middle 
Yellow River, China (Liu et al., 2014). Further studies demonstrate pre-instrumental or early instrumental 
differences in flood frequency compared to the instrumental period, including reconstructions of high and 
low flood frequency in the European Alps (e.g., Swierczynski et al., 2013; Amann et al., 2015) and 
Himalayas (Ballesteros Cánovas et al., 2017). The combination of extreme historical flood episodes 
determined from documentary evidence also increases confidence in the determination of flood frequency 
and magnitude, compared to using geomorphological archives alone (Kjeldsen et al., 2014). In regions, such 
as Europe and China, that have rich historical flood documents, there is strong evidence of high magnitude 
flood events over pre-instrumental periods (Benito et al., 2015; Kjeldsen et al., 2014; Macdonald and 
Sangster, 2017). A key feature of paleoflood records is variability in flood recurrence at centennial 
timescales (Wilhelm et al., 2019), although constraining climate-flood relationships remains challenging. 
Pre-instrumental floods often occurred in considerably different contexts in terms of land use, irrigation, and 
infrastructure, and may not provide direct insight into modern river systems, which further prevents long-
term assessments of flood changes being made based on these sources.  </p>

<p>There is medium confidence that periods of both more and less tropical cyclone activity (frequency or 
intensity) than observed occurred over the Common Era in many regions. Paleotempest studies cover a 
limited number of locations that are predominantly coastal, and hence provide information on specific 
locations that cannot be extrapolated basin-wide (see Muller et al., 2017). In some locations, such as the Gulf 
of Mexico and the New England coast, similarly intense storms to those observed recently have occurred 
multiple times over centennial timescales (Donnelly et al., 2001; Bregy et al., 2018). Further research 
focused on the frequency of tropical storm activity. Extreme storms occurred considerably more frequently 
in particular periods of the Common Era, compared to the instrumental period in northeast Queensland, 
Australia (Nott et al., 2009; Haig et al., 2014), and the Gulf Coast (e.g., Brandon et al., 2013; Lin et al., 
2014).  </p>

<p>The probability of finding an unprecedented extreme event increases with an increased length of past record-
keeping, in the absence of longer-term trends. Thus, as a record is extended to the past based on paleo-
reconstruction, there is a higher chance of very rare extreme events having occurred at some time prior to 
instrumental records. Such an occurrence is not, in itself, evidence of a change, or lack of a change, in the 
magnitude or the likelihood of extremes in the past or in the instrumental period at regional and local scales. 
Yet, the systematic collection of paleoclimate records over wide areas may provide evidence of changes in 
extremes. In one study, extended evidence of the last millennium from observational data and paleoclimate 
reconstructions using tree rings indicates human activities affected the worldwide occurrence of droughts as 
early as the beginning of the 20th century (Marvel et al., 2019).  </p>

<p>In summary, there is low confidence in overall changes in extremes derived from paleo-archives. The most 
robust evidence is high confidence that high-duration and severe drought events occurred at many locations 
during the last 2000 years. There is also high confidence that high-magnitude flood events occurred at some 
locations during the last 2000 years, but overall changes in infrastructure and human water management 
make the comparison with present-day records difficult. But these isolated paleo-drought and paleo-flood 
events are not evidence of a change, or lack of a change, in the magnitude or the likelihood of relevant 
extremes.  </p>
