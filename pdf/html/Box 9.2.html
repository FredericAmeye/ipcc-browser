<p>Marine heatwaves (MHW) are periods of extreme high sea temperature relative to the long-term mean 
seasonal cycle (Hobday et al., 2016). Studies since the SROCC (Collins et al., 2019) confirm the assessment 
that MHW can lead to severe and persistent impacts on marine ecosystems, from mass mortality of benthic 
communities including coral bleaching, changes in phytoplankton blooms, shifts in species composition and 
geographical distribution, toxic algal blooms to decline in fisheries catch and mariculture (Smale et al., 2019; 
Cheung and Frölicher, 2020; Hayashida et al., 2020a; Piatt et al., 2020). Unlike synoptic atmospheric 
heatwaves (Section 11.3), MHWs can extend for millions of square kilometres, persist for weeks to months, 
and occur at subsurface (Bond et al., 2015; Schaeffer and Roughan, 2017; Perkins-Kirkpatrick et al., 2018; 
Laufkötter et al., 2020).  </p>

<p>The SROCC established that MHWs have occurred in all basins over the last decades. Additional evidence 
documenting widespread occurrence of marine heat waves in all basins and marginal seas continues to 
accumulate (Li et al., 2019c; Yao et al., 2020). The SROCC highlighted the role of large-scale climate modes 
of variability in amplifying or suppressing MHW occurrences, which has since been further corroborated, 
increasing confidence in climate modes as important drivers of MHWs (Holbrook et al., 2019; Sen Gupta et 
al., 2020). More generally, understanding of processes leading to MHWs has increased since the SROCC, 
including air-sea heat flux (Section 9.2.1.2), increased horizontal heat advection, shoaling of the mixed layer 
and suppressed mixing processes (Section 9.2.1.3), reduced coastal upwelling and Ekman pumping (Section 
9.2.3.5), changes in eddy activities and planetary waves, and the re-emergence of warm subsurface 
anomalies (Holbrook et al., 2020; Sen Gupta et al., 2020).  </p>

<p>The SROCC reported with high confidence that MHWs (defined as days exceeding the 99th percentile in SST 
from 1982 to 2016) have very likely doubled in frequency between 1982 and 2016. Additional observation-
based evidence and acquisition of longer observation time-series since the SROCC have confirmed and 
expanded on this assessment: since the 1980s MHWs have also become more intense  and longer (Frölicher 
and Laufkötter, 2018; Smale et al., 2019; Laufkötter et al. 2020). Satellite observations and reanalyses of 
SST show increase in intensity of 0.04°C per decade from 1982 to 2016, an increase in spatial extent of 19 % 
per decade from 1982 to 2016, and an increase in annual MHW days of 54 % between the 1987-2016 period 
compared to 1925-1954 (Frölicher et al., 2018; Oliver, 2019). The SROCC assessed that 84-90% of all 
MHWs that occurred between 2006 and 2015 are very likely caused by anthropogenic warming. There is new 
evidence since SROCC that the frequency of the most impactful marine heatwaves over the last few decades 
has increased more than 20-fold because of anthropogenic global warming (Laufkötter et al., 2020). In 
summary, there is high confidence that MHWs have increased in frequency over the 20th century, with an 
approximate doubling from 1982-2016, and medium confidence that they have become more intense and 
longer since the 1980s.  </p>

<p>Consistent with the SROCC, future MHWs are defined with reference to the historical climate conditions. 
The SROCC assessed that MHWs will very likely further increase in frequency, duration, spatial extent and 
intensity under future global warming in the 21st century. CMIP6 projections allow us to confirm this 
assessment and quantify future change based on global mean probability ratio change (Box 9.2, Figure 1): 
they project MHWs will become 4 (5-95% range: 2-9) times more frequent in 2081-2100 compared to 1995-
2014 under SSP1-2.6, or 8 (3-15) times more frequent under SSP5-8.5. The SROCC highlighted that future 
change of MHWs will not be globally uniform, with the largest changes in the frequency of marine 
heatwaves being projected to occur in the western tropical Pacific and the Arctic Ocean (medium 
confidence). New evidence from the latest generation of climate models confirms and complements the 
SROCC assessment (Box 9.2, Figure 1). Moderate increases are projected for mid-latitudes, and only small 
increases are projected for the Southern Ocean (medium confidence) (Hayashida et al., 2020b). While under 
the SSP5-8.5 scenario, permanent MHWs (more than 360 days per year) are projected to occur in the 21st 
century in parts of the tropical ocean, the Arctic Ocean and around 45°S, the occurrence of such permanent 
MHWs can largely be avoided under the SSP1-2.6 scenario (Frölicher et al., 2018; Oliver et al., 2019; Plecha 
and Soares, 2020). The resolution of current climate models (CMIP5 and CMIP6) capture the broad features 
of MHWs, but they may have a bias towards weaker and longer MHWs in the historical period (medium 
confidence) (Frölicher et al., 2018; Pilo et al., 2019; Plecha and Soares, 2020) and greater intensification in 
western boundary current regions (Hayashida et al., 2020b). </p>
