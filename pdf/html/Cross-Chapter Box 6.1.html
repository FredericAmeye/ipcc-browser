<p>In response to the outbreak of COVID-19 (officially the severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 or 
SARS-CoV-2), which was declared a pandemic on March 11 2020 by the World Health Organization 
(WHO), regulations were imposed by many countries to contain the spread of COVID-19. Restrictions were 
implemented on the movement of people, such as closing borders or requiring the majority of population to 
stay at home, for periods of several months. This Cross Chapter Box assess the influence of the COVID-19 
containment on short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) and long-lived greenhouse gases (LLGHGs) and related 
implications for the climate. Note that this assessment was developed late in the AR6 WGI process and is 
based on the available emerging literature. </p>

<h3>Emissions</h3>

<p>Global fossil CO2 emissions are estimated to have declined by 7% (medium confidence) in 2020 compared to 
2019 emissions, with estimates ranging from 5.8% to 13.0% based on various combinations of data on 
energy production and consumption, economic activity and proxy activity data for emissions and economic 
activity and proxy activity data for emissions and their drivers 
(Forster et al., 2020; Friedlingstein et al., 2020; Le Quéré et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). <br />
However, the concentration of atmospheric CO2 continued to grow in 2020 compared to previous years 
(Dlugokencky and Tans, 2021). Given the large natural inter-annual variability of CO2 (Section 5.2.1), and 
the small expected impact of emissions in the CO2 growth rate, there were no observed changes in CO2 
concentration that could be attributed to COVID-19 containment (Chevallier et al., 2020; Tohjima et al., 
2020).  </p>

<p>Global daily CO2 emissions from fossil fuel sources had a maximum decline of 17% in early April, 
compared with the mean 2019 levels, and coinciding with the global peak pandemic lockdown  (Le Quéré et 
al., 2020). The reductions in CO2 emissions in 2020 were dominated by the drop in emissions from surface 
transport followed, in order of absolute emission reductions, by industry, power, and aviation (Le Quéré et 
al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020).  Residential emissions showed little change (Liu et al., 2020) or rose slightly 
(Forster et al., 2020; Le Quéré et al., 2020). Aviation had the biggest relative drop in activity accounting. 
CO2 emissions due to land-use (based on early and uncertain evidence on deforestation and forest fires) were 
higher than average in 2020  (Amador-Jiménez et al., 2020).  </p>

<p>Using similar methodologies, (Forster et al., 2020) assembled activity data and emissions estimates for other 
greenhouse gases and aerosols and their precursors. Anthropogenic NOx emissions, which are largely from 
the transport sector, are estimated to have decreased by a maximum of 35% in April (medium confidence). 
Species whose emissions are dominated by other sectors, such as CH4 and NH3 from agriculture, saw smaller 
reductions.  </p>

<h3>Abundances and air quality</h3>

<p>Owing to the short atmospheric lifetimes of SLCFs relevant to air quality, changes in their concentrations 
were detected within few days after lockdowns had been implemented (e.g., Bauwens et al., 2020b; 
Gkatzelis et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2021; Venter et al., 2020b). The COVID-19 driven economic slowdown has 
illustrated how complex the relationship is between emissions and air pollutant concentrations due to non-
linearity in the atmospheric chemistry leading to secondary compound formation (see also Section 6.1 <br />
and Box 6.1)  (Kroll et al., 2020). </p>

<p>Several studies have examined the effect of COVID-19 containment on air quality, showing that multi-year 
datasets with proper statistical/modelling analysis are required to discriminate the effect of meteorology from 
that of emission reduction (Dhaka et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020b; Wang et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020b) . 
Accounting for meteorological influences and with increasing stringency index, the median observed change 
in NO2 decreased from -13% to -48%, and in PM2.5 decreased from -10% to -33%, whereas the median 
change in O3 increased from 0% to 4% (Gkatzelis et al., 2021). The latter can be explained by the decrease of 
NO emissions that titrate ozone in specific highly polluted areas, leading to the observed increase in surface 
O3 concentration in cities (Huang et al., 2020a; Le et al., 2020; Sicard et al., 2020). </p>

<p>The temporary decrease of PM2.5 concentrations should be put in perspective of the sustained reduction 
(estimated at 30% to 70%), which could be achieved by implementing policies addressing air quality and 
climate change (see Section 6.6.3). Such sustained reductions can lead to multiple benefits and 
simultaneously achieve several SDGs (Section 6.6.3). These policies would also result in reduction of 
ground-level ozone by up to 20% (see Section 6.7.1.3). </p>

<p>Except for ozone, temporary improvement of air quality during lockdown periods was observed in most 
regions of the world (high confidence), resulting from a combination of inter-annual meteorological 
variability and impact of COVID-19 containment measures (high confidence). Estimated air pollution 
reductions associated with lockdown periods are lower than what can be expected from integrated mitigation 
policy leading to lasting reductions (medium confidence). </p>

<h3>Radiative forcings</h3>

<p>COVID-19 related emission changes primarily exerted effective radiative forcing (ERF) through reduced 
emission rates of CO2 and methane, altered abundance of short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), notably O3, 
NO2 and aerosols, and through other changes in anthropogenic activities, notably a reduction in the 
formation of aviation-induced cirrus clouds.  </p>

<p>Forster et al. (2020) combined the FaIR emulator (see Cross-Chapter Box 7.1) with emission changes for a 
range of species, relative to a continuation of Nationally Determined Contributions  (Rogelj et al., 2017). 
They found a negative ERF from avoided CO2 emissions that strengthens through 2020, to -0.01 W⋅m<sup>-2</sup>. 
During the spring lockdown, they found a peak positive ERF of 0.1 W⋅m<sup>-2</sup> from loss of aerosol-induced 
cooling, and a peak negative ERF of -0.04 W⋅m<sup>-2</sup> from reductions in tropospheric ozone (from reduced 
photochemical production via NOx). Overall, they estimated a net ERF of +0.05 W⋅m<sup>-2</sup> for spring 2020, 
declining to +0.025 W⋅m<sup>-2</sup> by the end of the year. </p>

<p>Gettelman et al. (2021) extended  Forster et al. (2020) results using two ESMs, and found a spring peak 
aerosol-induced ERF ranging from 0.12 to 0.3 W⋅m<sup>-2</sup>, depending on the aerosol parameterization. They also 
estimated an ERF of -0.04 W⋅m<sup>-2</sup> from loss of contrail warming. Overall, they report a peak ERF of 0.04 to 
0.2 W⋅m<sup>-2</sup>, and a subsequent decline to around half the peak value. </p>

<p>Two independent ESM studies, Weber et al. (2020) and  Yang et al. (2020), found consistent results in time 
evolution and component contributions, but included fewer forcing components. </p>

<p>The available studies are in broad agreement on the sign and magnitude of contributions to ERF from 
COVID-19 related emission changes during 2020. The peak global mean ERF, in spring 2020, <br />
was [0.025-0.2] W⋅m<sup>-2</sup> (medium confidence), composed by a positive forcing from aerosol-climate 
interactions of [0.1-0.3] W⋅m<sup>-2</sup>, and negative forcings from CO2 (-0.01 W⋅m<sup>-2</sup>), NOx (-0.04 W⋅m<sup>-2</sup>) and contrail 
cirrus (-0.04 W⋅m<sup>-2</sup>) (low evidence, medium agreement). By the end of 2020, the ERF was at half the peak 
value (medium confidence).  </p>

<h3>Climate responses</h3>

<p>Changes in atmospheric composition due to COVID-19 emissions reductions are not thought to have caused 
a detectable change in global temperature or rainfall in 2020 (high confidence). A large ensemble of Earth 
System Model (ESM) simulations show an ensemble average reduction in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) in 
some regions, notably eastern and southern Asia (Fyfe et al., 2021). This result is supported by observational 
studies finding decreases in optical depth in 2020 (Gkatzelis et al., 2021; Ming et al., 2021; van Heerwaarden 
et al., 2021), which may have contributed to observed increases in solar irradiance (van Heerwaarden et al., 
2021) or solar clear-sky reflection (Ming et al., 2021).  </p>

<p>Model simulations of the response to COVID-19 emissions reductions indicate a small warming of global 
surface air temperature (GSAT) due to a decrease in sulphate aerosols (Forster et al., 2020; Fyfe et al., 2021), 
balanced by cooling due to an ozone decrease (Forster et al., 2020; Weber et al., 2020), black carbon 
decrease (Weber et al., 2020) and CO2 decrease. It is noted that observational studies report little SO2 
change, at least locally near the surface (Shi et al., 2021)  and do not correlate with emission inventory based 
changes  (Gkatzelis et al., 2021). One study suggests a small net warming while another using idealized 
simulations suggests a small cooling  (Weber et al., 2020). Simulated GSAT and rainfall changes are 
unlikely to be detectable in observations (Samset et al., 2020; Fyfe et al., 2021) (high confidence). </p>

<p>Multi-model ESM simulations based on a realistic COVID-19 containment forcing scenario (Forster et al., 
2020)  indicate a model mean reduction in regional AOD but no discernible response in GSAT (Cross-
Chapter Box 6.1 Figure 1). </p>

<p>Scenarios of future emissions following COVID-19 disruption have been examined under a range of 
hypothetical assumptions (Forster et al., 2020).  </p>
