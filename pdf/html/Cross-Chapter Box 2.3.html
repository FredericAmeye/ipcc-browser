<p>This Cross-Chapter Box presents the AR6 WGI assessment of observed global warming and describes 
improvements and updates since AR5 and subsequent Special Reports. The revised estimates result from: the 
availability of new and revised observational datasets; the occurrence of recent record warm years; and the 
evaluation of the two primary metrics used to estimate global warming in past IPCC reports: “Global mean 
surface temperature” (GMST) and “Global surface air temperature” (GSAT). Implications for threshold 
crossing times, remaining carbon budgets and impacts assessments across AR6 WGs are discussed.  </p>

<h3>Dataset innovations</h3>

<p>Since AR5, all major datasets used for assessing observed temperature change based upon GMST have been 
updated and improved (Section 2.3.1.1.3). A number of new products have also become available, including 
new datasets (e.g. Berkeley Earth, Rohde &amp; Hausfather, 2020) and new interpolations based on existing 
datasets (e.g. Cowtan and Way (2014) and Kadow et al. (2020a)). These various estimates are not fully 
independent.  </p>

<p>Improvements in global temperature datasets since AR5 have addressed two major systematic issues. First, 
new SST datasets (Huang et al., 2017; Kennedy et al., 2019) address deficiencies previously identified in 
AR5 relating to the shift from predominantly ship-based to buoy-based measurements; these improvements 
result in larger warming trends, particularly in recent decades. Second, all datasets now employ interpolation 
to improve spatial coverage. This is particularly important in the Arctic, which has warmed faster than the 
rest of the globe in recent decades (Atlas 5.9.2.2); under-sampling of the Arctic leads to a cool bias in recent 
decades (Simmons et al., 2017; Benestad et al., 2019). Some datasets are now spatially complete (Cowtan 
and Way, 2014; Kadow et al., 2020a) while others have expanded spatial coverage (Lenssen et al., 2019; 
Morice et al., 2021; Rohde &amp; Hausfather, 2020; Vose et al., 2021). Several interpolation methods have been 
benchmarked against test cases (e.g. Lenssen et al., 2019), and comparisons with reanalyses further confirm 
the value of such interpolation (Simmons et al., 2017). It is extremely likely that interpolation produces an 
improved estimate of the changes in GMST compared to ignoring data-void regions. </p>

<p>Overall, dataset innovations and the availability of new datasets have led to an assessment of increased 
GMST change relative to the directly equivalent estimates reported in AR5 (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3, Table 1 
and Figure 1). </p>

<h3>Effects of warming since AR5 and choice of metrics of global mean temperature change</h3>

<p>Each of the six years from 2015 to 2020 has likely been warmer than any prior year in the instrumental 
record. GMST for the decade 2011–2020 has been 0.19 [0.16 to 0.22] °C warmer than 2003–2012, the most 
recent decade used in AR5 (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3, Figure 1). A linear trend has become a poorer 
representation of observed change over time since most of the sustained warming has occurred after the 
1970s (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3 Figure 1) and all values since 2012 are at least 0.2°C above a linear trendline 
for 1850–2020. For this reason, the primary method used to assess observed warming in this report is the 
change in temperature from 1850–1900 to the most recent decade (2011–2020) or the recent past (1995–
2014), replacing the trend-based methods used in AR5 and earlier assessments. The effect of this change 
from trend-based to change-based metrics is currently relatively minor at -0.03°C (&lt;5%) for the most recent 
decade, but this may not remain the case in future (high confidence). </p>

<h3>Observed changes in global mean temperature since the pre-industrial era</h3>

<p>AR5 used 1850–1900 as an approximate pre-industrial baseline for global temperature change, whilst using 
an earlier pre-industrial baseline of 1750 for radiative forcings. Cross-Chapter Box 1.2 assesses that there was an observed GMST change from the period around 1750 to 1850–1900 of around 0.1°C (likely range -
0.1 to +0.3°C, medium confidence). This additional global temperature change before 1850–1900 is not 
included when making AR6 assessments on global warming to date, global temperature threshold crossing 
times, or remaining carbon budgets to ensure consistency with previous ARs. </p>

<h3>Addressing the non-equivalence of GMST and GSAT</h3>

<p>GMST is a combination of land surface air temperatures (LSAT) and SSTs, whereas GSAT is a combination 
of LSAT and marine air temperatures (MATs). Although GMST and GSAT are closely related, the two 
measures are physically distinct. The implications have become more apparent since AR5 (Cowtan et al., 
2015; IPCC, 2018 (SR1.5); Merchant et al., 2013; Richardson et al., 2018; Simmons et al., 2017), and it has 
been shown (Rubino et al., 2020) that MAT and SST can show distinct multidecadal-scale trends and 
patterns of interannual variability. Although the SR1.5 used GMST for observational-based and GSAT for 
model-based headline warming statements, they noted the importance of the difference for their assessment 
(SR1.5 Section 1.2.1.1). SR1.5 used information from CMIP5 models to estimate a GSAT equivalent from 
observation-based GMST for certain applications such as remaining carbon budgets. The following 
subsections assess available lines of evidence related to the equivalence between GMST and GSAT.  </p>

<h4>Physical understanding</h4>

<p>A well-understood physical constraint on the vertical gradient between the air and sea surface temperature is 
that it is approximately proportional to the turbulent sensible heat flux in the atmospheric surface layer (Chor 
et al., 2020). Similarly, the latent heat flux scales with the vertical humidity gradient and, in the global mean 
and in most oceanic regions, the latent heat flux is substantially larger than the sensible heat flux (Sections 
7.2.1, 9.2.1.3). If GSAT were to warm faster than GMST, the sensible surface heat flux would respond so as 
to reduce this difference. However, it is the sum of the sensible, latent, and radiative heat fluxes that controls 
GMST, so the sensible heat flux effect cannot be considered in isolation. Attempts to further constrain the 
combination of fluxes (e.g., Lorenz et al., 2010; Siler et al., 2019) rely on parameterisations or output from 
Earth system models (ESMs) or reanalyses and so are not considered independent. Apart from the above 
global considerations, regional and seasonal effects such as changes to the frequency and intensity of storms, 
sea state, cloudiness, sea ice cover, vegetation and land use may all affect the GSAT to GMST difference, 
either directly or by altering the relationships between gradients and energy fluxes. These changing energy 
flux relationships are monitored through observing the stratification of the upper ocean (Section 9.2.1.3) and 
the response of upper ocean processes (Cross-Chapter Box 5.3) in ESMs and reanalyses, but such monitoring 
tasks rival the observational challenge of directly observing SSTs and 2 m air temperature under a wide 
range of conditions. In summary, because of the lack of physical constraints and the complexity of processes 
driving changes in the GSAT to GMST temperature differences, there is no simple explanation based on 
physical grounds alone for how this difference responds to climate change. </p>

<h4>Direct observational evidence</h4>

<p>There is currently no regularly updated, entirely observation-based dataset for GSAT. The best available 
observations of near-surface air temperature over ocean are datasets of night-time marine air temperature 
(NMAT) (e.g. Cornes et al., 2020; Junod &amp; Christy, 2020), though spatial coverage is less extensive than for 
SST. Night-time measurements are used to avoid potential biases from daytime heating of ship 
superstructures. Kennedy et al. (2019) show little difference between HadNMAT2 and HadSST4 between 
1920 and 1990, but a warming of SST relative to NMAT manifesting as a step change of 0.05°C–0.10°C in 
the early 1990s, which may reflect an actual change, the impact of increasingly divergent spatial coverage 
between SST and MAT measurements, or unresolved structural uncertainties in one or both datasets. This 
leads to NMAT warming around 10% more slowly than SST over the last century. In contrast, Junod and 
Christy (2020a) find NMAT trends which are 8–17% larger than those for SST in the ERSSTv4 and 
HadISST datasets for the period 1900 to 2010, but 11–15% smaller than the SST trends for the same datasets 
from 1979 to 2010. However, ERSSTv4 uses NMAT data as a basis for homogeneity adjustment so is not 
fully independent. Kent and Kennedy (2021) note sensitivity to methodological choices in comparisons but 
find that NMAT is warming more slowly than SST products over most periods considered. Rubino et al. (2020) exploit tropical Pacific moored buoy arrays, available since the early 1980s, and find differences in 
NMAT and SST anomalies, which are sensitive to the choice of period and show spatio-temporal ENSO-
related (Annex IV) signals in the differences.  </p>

<p>Overall, with medium evidence and low agreement, available observational products suggest that NMAT is 
warming less than SST by up to 15%. Given that these ocean observations cover roughly two thirds of the 
globe, this implies that GMST is warming up to at most 10% faster than GSAT. Substantial uncertainty 
remains and the effect is highly sensitive to the choice of both time period and choice of NMAT and SST 
observational products to compare. Observed NMAT warming faster than observed SST cannot be 
precluded. </p>

<h4>CMIP model-based evidence</h4>

<p>CMIP historical simulations and projections agree that GSAT increases faster than GMST, the reverse of 
what is indicated by many marine observations. Several studies approximate the approach used to derive 
GMST from observations by blending SST over open ocean and SAT over land and sea ice from model 
output (Cowtan et al., 2015; Richardson et al., 2018; Beusch et al., 2020; Gillett et al., 2021). Cowtan et al. 
(2015) found that trends in GSAT are of the order of 9% larger than for GMST in CMIP5, based on data 
from 1850–2100 (historical + RCP8.5), if anomalies are blended and sea ice is allowed to vary over time. 
Broadly consistent numbers are found for both CMIP5 and CMIP6, across a range of SSP and RCP scenarios 
and time periods (Richardson et al., 2018; Beusch et al., 2020; Gillett et al., 2021). Blending monthly 
anomalies and allowing sea ice to vary, the change in GSAT for 2010–2019 relative to 1850–1900 is 2–8% 
larger than spatially-complete GMST in CMIP6 historical and SSP2-4.5 simulations (Gillett et al., 2021), 
and 6–12% larger in CMIP5 historical and RCP2.6 and 8.5 simulations for 2007–2016 relative to 1861–1880 
(Richardson et al., 2018). However, a true like-for-like comparison to observational products is challenging 
because methodological choices have a large impact on the relationship between modelled GMST and GSAT 
and none of these studies fully reproduces the methods used to derive estimates of GMST in recent 
observational datasets, which use various ways to infill areas lacking in situ observations (Jones, 2020).  </p>

<p>Marine boundary layer behaviour and parameterisations in all CMIP models are based upon Monin-Obukhov 
similarity theory (e.g. Businger et al., 1971), which informs assumptions around gradients in the near-surface 
boundary layer dependent upon temperature, wind speed and humidity. This leaves open the possibility of a 
common model bias, while Druzhinin et al. (2019) also point to departures of temperature profiles from 
theoretical predictions under certain conditions. There remain inadequacies in understanding and modelling 
of key processes (Edwards et al., 2020), and biases in the representation of the absolute SST-MAT difference 
have been identified in climate models and reanalyses (Găinuşă-Bogdan et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2020). </p>

<h4>Reanalysis-based evidence</h4>

<p>Simmons et al. (2017) found that in JRA-55 and ERA-Interim (following an adjustment to account for an 
apparent discontinuity), GSAT increased 2–4% faster than GMST over the period 1979–2016. 
In atmospheric reanalyses, SST is given as a lower boundary condition from an observed globally 
interpolated product (such as HadISST; Rayner et al., 2003) whereas the air temperature is reliant upon 
model parameterisations and assimilated observations that do not include MAT observations (Simmons et 
al., 2017), thereby limiting their capability to constrain differences in GMST and GSAT trends. Furthermore, 
it is unclear what the lack of dynamic coupling at the ocean-atmosphere interface might imply for the 
representativeness of reanalysis-based estimates.  </p>

<h4>Representation of surface temperatures in sea ice regions</h4>

<p>There is a significant issue in areas where sea-ice melts or grows, where the quantity used in observational-
based GMST estimates switches between air temperature and sea surface temperature. This primarily affects 
analyses combining SAT anomalies over land and ice with SST anomalies over ocean. In areas where sea ice 
has recently melted, the climatological value changes from an air-temperature based estimate to an SST 
estimate based upon the freezing point of seawater (–1.8°C). This switch in climatology to, in general, a 
warmer climatology, leads to a bias towards reduced warming in anomalies compared with analyses based on absolute temperatures. Richardson et al. (2018) found this underestimation to amount to approximately 
3% of observed warming in historical model simulations. Given the projected future sea-ice losses, the effect 
will grow in future (low confidence), with potential effects of the order of 0.1°C in the second half of the 21st 
century under high warming scenarios, although with some uncertainty arising from the large spread of sea-
ice loss in model projections (Tokarska et al., 2019).  </p>

<h4>Summary of lines of evidence</h4>

<p>GMST and GSAT are physically distinct. There is high confidence that long-term changes in GMST and 
GSAT differ by at most 10% in either direction. However, conflicting lines of evidence from models and 
direct observations combined with limitations in theoretical understanding lead to low confidence in the sign 
of any difference in long-term trends. The very likely range of estimated historical GMST warming is 
combined with the assessed ± 10% uncertainty in the relationship between GMST and GSAT changes to 
infer a GSAT equivalent, accounting for any possible real-world physical difference. Improvements in 
understanding may yield a robust basis to apply a scaling-factor to account for the difference in future 
assessments. </p>

<h3>Mapping between AR5 and AR6 assessments</h3>

<p>The AR5 assessed estimate for historical warming between 1850–1900 and 1986–2005 is 0.61 [0.55 to 0.67] 
°C. The equivalent in AR6 is 0.69 [0.54 to 0.79] °C, and the 0.08 [-0.01 to 0.12] °C difference is an estimate 
of the contribution of changes in observational understanding alone (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3, Table 1). The 
exact value of this contribution depends upon the metric being compared (GMST/GSAT, trend or change, 
exact period). The AR6-assessed GMST warming between 1850–1900 and 2011–2020 is 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20] 
°C. An AR5-equivalent assessment using this estimated difference in observational understanding is thus 
1.01 [0.94 to 1.08] °C. These updates and improvements in observational datasets affect other quantities that 
derive from the assessment of GSAT warming, including estimates of remaining carbon budgets and 
estimates of crossing times of 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming (See Cross Chapter Box 2.3 Table 1). </p>

<h3>Updates to estimated Global Warming Level (GWL) crossing times</h3>

<p>The updated estimate of historical warming is one contribution to the revised time of projected crossing of 
the threshold of 1.5°C global warming in comparison with SR1.5, but is not the only reason for this update. 
The AR6 assessment of future change in GSAT (Section 4.3.4, Table 4.5) results in the following threshold-
crossing times, based on 20-year moving averages. The threshold-crossing time is defined as the midpoint of 
the first 20-year period during which the average GSAT exceeds the threshold. During the near term (2021–
2040), a 1.5°C GSAT increase relative to the average over the period 1850–1900 is very likely to occur in 
scenario SSP5-8.5, likely to occur in scenarios SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0, and more likely than not to occur in 
scenarios SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6. In all scenarios assessed here except SSP5-8.5, the central estimate of 
crossing the 1.5°C global warming level lies in the early 2030s. This is about ten years earlier than the 
midpoint of the likely range (2030–2052) assessed in the SR1.5, which assumed continuation of the then-
reported warming rate; this estimated rate has been confirmed in AR6 (Section 3.3.1). Roughly half of the 
ten-year difference arises from the higher diagnosed historical warming in AR6. The other half arises 
because, for central estimates of climate sensitivity, most scenarios show stronger warming over the near 
term than was assessed as ‘current’ in SR1.5 (medium confidence).   </p>

<h3>Implications for assessment of emission scenarios and remaining carbon budgets</h3>

<p>To estimate the global warming implications of emissions scenarios, AR5 and SR1.5 combined estimates of 
observed GMST changes from 1850–1900 to 1986–2005 (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3, Table 1) with GSAT 
projections of subsequent warming. AR6 undertakes three changes to this approach. First, the AR6 assessment of improved observational records is used. Second, the recent past baseline period is updated 
from 1986–2005 to 1995–2014, and, third, historical estimates are expressed in GSAT instead of GMST for 
consistency of historical estimates with future projections. The updated estimates of warming to date in AR6 
lead to higher estimates of future warming, all else being equal. The temperature classification of emissions 
scenarios in the WGIII report adopts the definition of temperature classes as introduced in SR1.5, and 
assigns emission scenarios to these classes based on their AR6 assessed GSAT outcomes (Cross-Chapter 
Box 7.1, WGIII Annex C.II.2.4).  </p>

<p>Both in AR5 and SR1.5, remaining carbon budgets were expressed as a function of GSAT warming, while 
also highlighting the implications of using historical warming estimates expressed in GMST. AR5 reported 
total carbon budgets for GSAT warming relative to 1861–1880. AR5 SYR also includes remaining carbon 
budget estimates based on AR5 WGIII scenario projections that use the method for AR5 scenario projections 
described above. SR1.5 integrated several methodological advancements to estimate remaining carbon 
budgets and reported budgets for additional GSAT warming since the 2006–2015 period, estimating, 
following the application of an adjustment (Richardson et al., 2016, Table 1.1. SR1.5) to GMST, that 0.97°C 
(± 0.12°C) of GSAT warming occurred historically between 1850–1900 and 2006–2015. The AR6 
assessment, above, leads to an estimate of 0.94°C of warming between 1850–1900 and 2006–2015. All other 
factors considered equal, the AR6 estimate thus implies that 0.03°C more warming is considered for 
remaining carbon budgets compared to SR1.5. Combining this 0.03°C value with the SR1.5 transient climate 
response to cumulative emissions of CO2 (TCRE) translates into remaining carbon budgets about 70 GtCO2 
[40 to 140 GtCO2] larger compared to SR1.5 on a like-for-like basis. Meanwhile, on the same like-for-like 
basis, updates to historical observational products would reduce remaining carbon budgets reported in AR5 
SYR based on WGIII scenario projections by about 180 GtCO2 [120 to 370 GtCO2]. Box 5.2 provides a 
further overview of updates to estimates of the remaining carbon budget since AR5.  </p>

<h3>Implications for assessment of impacts and adaptation</h3>

<p>The assessment of global warming to date now being larger than previously assessed has no consequence on 
the assessment of past climate impacts, nor does it generally imply that projected climate impacts are now 
expected to occur earlier. The implications are mainly that the level of warming associated with a particular 
impact has been revised. This has very limited practical implications for the assessment of the benefits of 
limiting global warming to specific levels, as well as for the urgency of adaptation action. For example, 
impacts that occurred in the period 1986–2005 were previously associated with a GMST increase of 0.61°C 
relative to 1850–1900, relative to AR5 estimates. These impacts are now instead associated with a GMST 
increase of 0.69°C, relative to the assessment in this Report. The impacts themselves have not changed. 
Similarly, the impacts previously associated with a GMST or GSAT increase of 1.5°C will now generally be 
associated with a slightly different global warming level. This is because projections of future warming and 
its impacts relative to 1850–1900 are normally made by adding projected warming from a recent past 
baseline to an estimate of the observed warming from 1850–1900, as in AR5 and SR1.5.  </p>

<p>Most of the previously projected impacts and risks associated with global warming of 1.5°C have therefore 
not changed and are still associated with the same level of future warming (0.89°C) relative to 1986–2005. 
With this warming now estimated as 0.08°C larger than in AR5, the future impacts previously associated 
with 1.5°C warming are now associated with 1.58°C warming. Similarly, the impacts now associated with 
1.5°C warming would have previously been associated with 1.42°C warming. There are exceptions where 
impacts studies have used a baseline earlier than 1986–2005 (e.g. King et al., 2017), for which the new 
estimate of the historical warming would mean an earlier occurrence of the projected impacts. However, 
even in these cases, the ostensible difference in impacts associated with a 0.08°C difference in global mean 
temperature will be small in comparison with the uncertainties. There are also substantial uncertainties in 
regional climate changes and the magnitude of climate impact-drivers projected to occur with global 
warming of 1.5°C (Betts et al., 2018; Seneviratne et al., 2018). Furthermore, the time of reaching global 
warming of 1.5°C is subject to uncertainties of approximately ± 10 years associated with uncertainties in 
climate sensitivity, and ± 3 to 4 years associated with the different SSP forcing scenarios (Section 4.3.4, 
Table 4.5 see prior discussion). There is therefore high confidence that assessment of the magnitude and 
timing of impacts-related climate quantities at 1.5°C is not substantially affected by the revised estimate of historical global warming. </p>

<p>The assessment of the implications of limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C will also remain 
broadly unchanged by the updated estimate of historical warming, as this depends on the relative impacts 
rather than the absolute impacts at any specific definition of global temperature anomaly (high confidence).  </p>
