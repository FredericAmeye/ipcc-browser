<p>This box assesses the present knowledge of the global energy budget for the period 1971–2018, i.e. the 
balance between radiative forcing, the total climate feedback and observations of the changes in the global 
energy inventory (Box 7.2, Figure 1a, d).  </p>

<p>The net ERF of the Earth system since 1971 has been positive (Box 7.2, Figure 1b, e; Section 7.3), mainly as 
a result of increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (Chapter 2, Section 2.2.8 and Section 
7.3.2). The ERF of these positive forcing agents have been partly offset by that of negative forcing agents, 
primarily due to anthropogenic aerosols (Section 7.3.3), which dominate the overall uncertainty. The net 
energy inflow to the Earth system from ERF since 1971 is estimated to be 937 ZJ (1 ZJ = 1021 J) with a likely 
range of 644 to 1259 ZJ (Box 7.2, Figure 1b). </p>

<p>The ERF-induced heating of the climate system results in increased thermal radiation to space via the Planck 
response, but the picture is complicated by a variety of climate feedbacks (Box 7.1; Section 7.4.2) that also 
influence Earth’s radiative response (Box 7.2, Figure 1c). The total radiative response is estimated by 
multiplying the assessed net feedback parameter, α, from process-based evidence (Section 7.4.2, Table 7.10) 
with the observed GSAT change for the period (Chapter 2, Cross Chapter Box 2.3) and time-integrating 
(Box 7.2, Figure 1c). The net energy outflow from the Earth system associated with the integrated radiative 
response 1971 is estimated to be 621 ZJ with a likely range of 419 to 823 ZJ. Assuming a pattern effect 
(Section 7.4.4) on α of -0.5 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> °C<sup>-1</sup> would lead to a systematically larger energy outflow by about 250 ZJ.  </p>

<p>Combining the likely range of integrated radiative forcing (Box 7.2, Figure 1b) with the central estimate of 
integrated radiative response (Box 7.2, Figure 1c) gives a central estimate and likely range of 340 [47 to 662] 
ZJ (Box 7.2, Figure 1f). Combining the likely range of integrated radiative response with the central estimate 
of integrated radiative forcing gives a likely range of 340 [147 to 527] ZJ (Box 7.2, Figure 1f). Both 
calculations yield an implied energy gain in the climate system that is consistent with an independent 
observation-based assessment of the increase in the global energy inventory expressed relative to the 
estimated 1850-1900 Earth energy imbalance (Box 7.2, Figure 1a; Section 7.5.2) with a central estimate and 
very likely range of 284 [96 to 471] ZJ (high confidence) (Box 7.2, Figure 1d; Table 7.1). Estimating the total 
uncertainty associated with radiative forcing and radiative response remains a scientific challenge and 
depends on the degree of correlation among the two (Box 7.2, Figure 1f). However, the central estimate of 
observed energy change falls well with the estimated likely range assuming either correlated or uncorrelated 
uncertainties. Furthermore, the energy budget assessment would accommodate a substantial pattern effect 
(Section 7.4.4.3) during 1971–2018 associated with systematically larger values of radiative response (Box 
7.2, Figure 1c), and potentially improved closure of the global energy budget. For the period 1970-2011, 
AR5 reported that the global energy budget was closed within uncertainties (high confidence) and consistent 
with the likely range of assessed climate sensitivity (Church et al., 2013). This report provides a more robust 
quantitative assessment based on additional evidence and improved scientific understanding. 
In addition to new and extended observations (Section 7.2.2), confidence in the observed accumulation of 
energy in the Earth system is strengthened by cross-validation of heating rates based on satellite and in situ 
observations (Section 7.2.2.1) and closure of the global sea-level budget using consistent datasets (Cross-
Chapter Box 9.1; Chapter 9, Table 9.5). Overall, there is high confidence that the global energy budget is 
closed for 1971–2018 with improved consistency compared to AR5 </p>
