<p>Changes in the atmospheric distribution of SLCFs determine their radiative forcing, and climate and air 
quality impacts. This box provides an overview of how process level understanding of the distribution and 
evolution of chemical compounds is derived and where uncertainties come from.   </p>

<p>Process-level understanding of tropospheric gas and aerosol chemistry developed through laboratory and 
simulation chamber experiments as well as quantum chemical theory is used to generate chemical 
mechanisms. Atmospheric simulation chambers are designed to identify the chemical pathways and quantify 
reaction kinetics in isolation from atmospheric transport, deposition and emission processes. Ideally the 
chemical regimes studied, are representative for ambient atmospheric complexity and concentrations (e.g., 
McFiggans et al., 2019). Recently, quantum chemical theory has advanced to a level that it can provide 
kinetic and product information in a parameter range not possible with laboratory experiments (Vereecken et 
al., 2015). Iterative and interlinked use of simulation chamber and quantum chemical theory has led to 
improved knowledge of chemical mechanisms (Fuchs et al., 2013a; Nguyen et al., 2010; Peeters et al., 2009, 
2014). For application in chemistry climate models (CCMs), the chemical mechanisms need to be 
computationally efficient, requiring simplifications. Such simplifications include reduced hydrocarbon 
representations, the application of lumping techniques (one compound or a chemical structure representing a 
family of compounds, for example, as done for parameterizing SOA formation) and/or the implementation of 
artificial operators representing key steps of the chemistry (Emmerson and Evans, 2009; Xia et al., 2009; 
Stockwell et al., 2020). Additionally, aerosol microphysical processes (nucleation, coagulation, 
condensation, evaporation, and sedimentation) that determine the evolution of aerosol number concentrations 
and size particle distribution are represented in parameterised forms in global models with varying levels of 
complexity (Mann et al., 2014). </p>

<p>A wide range of in situ and remotely sensed observations are used to characterise atmospheric chemical 
composition. Measurements made routinely as part of long-term monitoring programmes are particularly 
useful for assessing long-term trends and variability, and spatial distributions (as in Section 2.2, Section 6.3, 
and Section 7.3.3) while intensive field campaigns provide a more comprehensive view of atmospheric 
composition at a specific location for a limited time facilitating an improved process-level understanding. 
Retrieval of atmospheric concentrations from satellites, in particular, has been tremendously useful for 
providing global continuous coverage, although the retrievals themselves depend on prior information of 
atmospheric composition usually derived from models. Over the last decade or so, observations of
atmospheric concentrations have been combined with information from global chemistry-climate models to 
produce global assimilation and forecasting systems with the purpose of producing chemical reanalysis or 
improving model inputs (i.e., emissions or boundary conditions) and forecasts (Miyazaki et al., 2015; 
Randles et al., 2017; Inness et al., 2019).   </p>

<p>Global three-dimensional CCMs (Box 6.1, Figure 1) represent the full coupling of chemistry with climate 
physics (e.g., Morgenstern et al. 2017) with different levels of complexity (e.g, interactive aerosols with or 
without tropospheric and/or stratospheric chemistry). Methane concentrations are typically prescribed or 
constrained to observations while emissions of other SLCFs (or their precursors) are either prescribed or 
calculated interactively in the current generation of CCMs (Collins et al., 2017). CCMs, now part of Earth 
System Models (ESMs), are applied extensively to simulate the distribution and evolution of chemical 
compounds on a variety of spatial and temporal scales to improve current knowledge, make future 
projections and investigate global scale chemistry-climate interactions and feedbacks (see also Chapter 3 
Section 3.8.2.2). CCMs are also used to interpret observations to disentangle the processes that drive 
observed variability and trends. Some aspects of air quality, such as diurnal peaks or local threshold 
violations, strong gradient in chemical regimes and coupling between processes cannot be captured by 
relatively coarse spatial resolution (> 50 km) global CCMs (Markakis et al., 2014) and necessitate 
subsequent downscaling modelling exercises. </p>

<p>The skill of CCMs is typically assessed by their ability to reproduce observed abundance, and trends and 
variability of chemical compounds. However, uncertainty remains large because of observation limitations 
(errors and uncertainties, spatial and temporal coverage), model parameterizations (e.g., chemical 
mechanisms, photolysis schemes, parameterizations for mixing and convective transport, and deposition), 
model input parameters (e.g., reaction rate constants, emissions) and an incomplete understanding of the 
physical and chemical processes that determine SLCF distributions (Brasseur and Jacob, 2017; Young et al., 
2018). CCMs can therefore not capture every aspect of atmospheric chemical composition, but are expected 
to represent, as faithfully as possible, the sensitivity of chemical compounds to their drivers (e.g., 
anthropogenic emissions). Models are evaluated in multiple ways to identify their strengths and weaknesses 
in explaining the evolution of SLCF abundances. For example, CCM simulations are performed in the 
nudged or offline meteorology mode, that is, driven by observed or reanalysed meteorology rather than in the 
free-running mode, for consistent comparison of modelled chemical composition with observations for a 
specific time period (Dameris and JÃ¶ckel, 2013). Although, caution is exercised as nudging can alter the 
model climate resulting in unintentional impacts on the simulated atmospheric physics and/or chemistry 
(Orbe et al., 2018; Chrysanthou et al., 2019). Chemical mechanisms implemented in CCMs are evaluated 
and intercompared to assess their skill in capturing relevant chemistry features (e.g., Brown-Steiner et al. 
2018). The multi-model ensemble approach, employed for evaluating climate models, has been particularly 
useful for characterizing errors in CCM simulations of SLCFs related to structural uncertainty and internal 
variability (Naik et al., 2013b; Shindell et al., 2013; Turnock et al., 2020; Young et al., 2013).  However, as 
discussed in BOX 4.1, this approach is unable to capture the full uncertainty range.  </p>

<p>This assessment draws upon results from single model studies and recent multi-model intercomparisons 
(e.g., AeroCom, CCMI), in particular those endorsed by CMIP6, which then allows for the full consideration 
of robustness and uncertainty due to model structures and processes. Based on the collective information 
provided in this body of literature, the CMIP6 multimodel ensemble is largely fit-for-purpose of evaluating 
the influence of SLCFs on radiative forcing, climate and non-CO2 biogeochemical feedbacks. Additionally, 
CMIP6 models are fit for capturing global air pollution response to changes in emissions and meteorology 
but have difficulty in simulating the mean state (Turnock et al., 2020). The set of CMIP6 simulations has 
been used to update the relations between emissions and surface temperature at the heart of the emulators 
(Cross-Chapter box 7.1) and update emission metrics (Section 7.6). Emulators and emission metrics are used 
in this chapter (Sections 6.5 and 6.7) to assess more specifically the effect of the individual SLCFs for each 
sector and region which would be of prohibitive computing cost with CCMs. CCMs are also used to build 
global source-receptor models which use relations between surface concentrations and emissions. Such a 
model is used to assess the impact of various mitigation on air quality (Sections 6.5 and 6.7.) </p>
