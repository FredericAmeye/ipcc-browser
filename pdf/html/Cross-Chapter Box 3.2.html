<h3>Attribution of temperature extremes</h3>

<p>One important aspect of various indicators of temperature extremes is their connection to mean temperature 
at local, regional and global scales. For example, the highest daily temperature in a summer is often highly 
correlated with the summer mean temperature. Model projections show that changes in temperature extremes 
are often closely related to shifts in mean temperature (Seneviratne et al., 2016; Kharin et al., 2018). It is thus 
no surprise that changes in temperature extremes are consistent with warming mean temperature, with 
warming leading to more hot extremes and fewer cold extremes. Given the attribution of mean warming to 
human influence (Section 3.3.1), and the connection between changes in mean and extreme temperatures, it 
is to be expected that anthropogenic forcing has also influenced temperature extremes.  </p>

<p>Chapter 11 assesses that there is high confidence that climate models can reproduce the mean state and overall warming of temperature extremes observed globally and in most regions, although the magnitude of 
the trends may differ, and the ability of models to capture observed trends in temperature-related extremes 
depends on the metric evaluated, the way indices are calculated, and the time periods and spatial scales 
considered (Section 11.3.3). There has been widespread evidence of human influence on various aspects of 
temperature extremes, at global, continental, and regional scales. This includes attribution to human 
influence of observed changes in intensity, frequency, and duration and other relevant characteristics at 
global and continental scales (Section 11.3.4). The left panel of Cross-Chapter Box 3.2, Figure 1 clearly 
shows that long-term changes in the global mean annual maximum daily maximum temperature can be 
reproduced by both CMIP5 and CMIP6 models forced with the combined effect of natural and 
anthropogenic forcings, but cannot be reproduced by simulations under natural forcing alone. Consistent 
with the assessment for global mean temperature (Section 3.3.1), aerosol changes are found to have offset 
part of the greenhouse gas induced increase in hot extremes globally and over most continents over the 1951-
2015 period (Hu et al., 2020; Seong et al., 2021), though greenhouse gas and aerosol influences are less 
clearly separable in observed changes in cold extremes. </p>

<p>Chapter 11 assesses that it is virtually certain that human-induced greenhouse gas forcing is the main 
contributor to the observed increase in the likelihood and severity of hot extremes and the observed decrease 
in the likelihood and severity of cold extremes on global scales, and very likely that this applies on most 
continents.  </p>

<h3>Attribution of precipitation extremes</h3>

<p>An important piece of evidence supporting the SREX and AR5 assessment that there is medium confidence 
that anthropogenic forcing has contributed to a global scale intensification of heavy precipitation during the 
second half of the 20th century is the evidence for anthropogenic influence on other aspects of the global 
hydrological cycle. The most significant aspect of that is the increase in atmospheric moisture content 
associated with warming which should, in general, lead to enhanced extreme precipitation, particularly 
associated with enhanced convergence in tropical and extratropical cyclones (Sections 8.2.3.2, 11.4.1). Such 
a connection is supported by the fact that annual maximum one-day precipitation increases with global mean 
temperature at a rate similar to the increase in the moisture holding capacity in response to warming, both in 
observations and in model simulations. Additionally, models project an increase in extreme precipitation 
across global land regions even in areas in which total annual or seasonal precipitation is projected to 
decrease.  </p>

<p>The overall performance of CMIP6 models in simulating extreme precipitation intensity and frequency is 
similar to that of CMIP5 models (high confidence), and there is high confidence in the ability of models to 
capture the large-scale spatial distribution of precipitation extremes over land (Section 11.4.3). Evidence of 
human influence on extreme precipitation has become stronger since the AR5. Considering changes in 
precipitation intensity averaged over all wet days, there is high confidence that daily mean precipitation 
intensities have increased since the mid-20th century in a majority of land regions, including Europe, North 
America and Asia, and it is likely that such an increase is mainly due to anthropogenic emissions of 
greenhouse gases (Section 8.3.1.3 and 11.4.4). Section 11.4.4 also finds a larger fraction of land showing 
enhanced extreme precipitation and a larger probability of record-breaking one-day precipitation than 
expected by chance, which can only be explained when anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing is considered. 
The right panel of Cross-Chapter Box 3.2, Figure 1 demonstrates the consistency in global average annual 
maximum daily precipitation in the observations and model simulations under combined anthropogenic and 
natural forcing, and inconsistency with natural forcing alone. While there is more evidence in the literature to 
quantify the net anthropogenic influence on extreme precipitation than the influence of individual forcing 
components, a dominant contribution of greenhouse gas forcing to the long-term intensification of extreme 
precipitation on global and continental scales has recently been quantified separately from the influence of 
anthropogenic aerosol and natural forcings (Dong et al., 2020; Paik et al., 2020b).  </p>

<p>Chapter 11 assesses that it is likely that human influence, in particular due to greenhouse gas forcing, is the 
main driver of the observed intensification of heavy precipitation in global land regions during recent 
decades (Section 11.4.4).  </p>
