<p>Bias adjustment is an approach to post-process climate model output and has become widely used in climate 
hazard and impact studies (Gangopadhyay et al., 2011; Hagemann et al., 2013; Warszawski et al., 2014) and 
national assessment reports (Cayan et al., 2013; Georgakakos et al., 2014). Despite its wide use, bias 
adjustment was not assessed in AR5 (Flato et al., 2014). Several problems have been identified that may 
arise from an uncritical use of bias adjustment, and that may result in misleading impact assessments. The 
rationale of this Cross-Chapter Box is to provide an overview of the use of bias adjustment in this report, and 
to assess key limitations of the approach. </p>

<p>Bias-adjusted climate model output is used extensively throughout this report. Several results from Chapter 
8, and many of the climatic impact-drivers in Chapter 12 (Section 12.2) are based on bias adjustment. The 
Atlas presents many results both as raw and bias-adjusted data (Atlas.1.4.5). The application of bias 
adjustment in the WGI1 report was informed by the assessment in Chapter 10 and this Cross-Chapter Box. 
Finally, bias adjustment is crucial for many studies assessed in the WG II report. An overview of bias 
adjustment can be found in Section 10.3.1.3, a general performance assessment of individual method classes 
in Section 10.3.3.7. The fitness of bias adjustment for climate change applications is assessed in Section 
10.3.3.9. </p>

<h3>Relevance of bias adjustment</h3>

<p>An argument made for the use of bias adjustment is the fact that impact models are commonly very sensitive, 
often nonlinearly, to the input climatic variables and their biases, in particular when threshold-based climate 
indices are required (Dosio, 2016). There are, however, cases where bias adjustment may not be necessary or 
useful, such as: when only qualitative statements are required; when only changes in mean climate are 
considered (instead of absolute values); when percentile-based indices are used. </p>

<h3>Modification of the climate change signal</h3>

<p>Bias adjustment methods like quantile mapping can modify simulated climate trends, with impacts on 
changes to climate indices, in particular, extremes (Haerter et al., 2011; Dosio et al., 2012; Ahmed et al., 
2013; Hempel et al., 2013; Maurer and Pierce, 2014; Cannon et al., 2015; Dosio, 2016; Casanueva et al., 
2020). Some argue that these trend modifications are implicit corrections of state-dependent biases (Boberg 
and Christensen, 2012; Gobiet et al., 2015). However, others argue that the modification is generally invalid 
because the modification is linked to the representation of day-to-day rather than long-term variability 
(Pierce et al., 2015; Maraun et al., 2017); a given temperature value does not necessarily belong to the same 
weather state in present and future climate (Maraun et al., 2017); the modification affects the models climate 
sensitivity (Hempel et al., 2013); and is affected by random internal climate variability (Switanek et al., 
2017). Thus, trend preserving quantile mapping methods have been developed (Section 10.3.1.3.2), although 
some authors found no clear advantage of these methods (Maurer and Pierce, 2014). Further research is 
required to fully understand the validity of trend modifications by quantile-mapping. </p>

<h3>Bias adjustment in the presence of large-scale circulation errors</h3>

<p>The large-scale circulation has a strong impact on regional climate, thus circulation errors will cause regional 
climate biases (Section 10.3.3.3). As bias adjustment in general does not account for circulation errors, it is 
therefore important to understand the impact of these errors on the outcome of the bias adjustment (Addor et 
al., 2016; Photiadou et al., 2016; Maraun et al., 2017). If the frequency of precipitation-relevant weather 
types is biased, a standard bias adjustment (not accounting for this frequency bias) would remove the overall 
climatological bias, but the precipitation falling in a given weather type could still be substantially biased 
(Addor et al., 2016). Adjusting the number of wet days can artificially deteriorate the spell-length 
distribution (Maraun et al., 2017). In the presence of location biases of circulation patterns, bias adjustment 
may introduce physically implausible solutions (Maraun et al., 2017). Bias adjusting the location of 
circulation features (Levy et al., 2013) may introduce inconsistencies with the model orography, land-sea 
contrasts, and SSTs (Maraun et al., 2017). </p>

<p>There is medium confidence that the selection of climate models with low biases in the frequency, 
persistence and location of large-scale atmospheric circulation can reduce negative impacts of bias 
adjustment. </p>

<h3>Using bias adjustment for statistical downscaling</h3>

<p>Bias adjustment is often used to downscale climate model results from grid box data to finer resolution or 
point scale. It is sometimes even directly applied to coarse-resolution global model output to avoid an 
intermediate dynamical downscaling step (Johnson and Sharma, 2012; Stoner et al., 2013). But bias 
adjustment does not add any information about the processes acting on un-resolved scales and is therefore by 
construction not capable of bridging substantial scale gaps (Maraun, 2013a; Maraun et al., 2017). Using bias 
adjustment for downscaling has been shown to artificially modify long-term trends, misrepresent the spatial 
characteristics of extreme events, and misrepresent local weather phenomena such as temperature inversions 
(Maraun, 2013a; Gutmann et al., 2014; Maraun et al., 2017). Crucially, sub-grid influences on the local 
climate change signal are not represented. For instance, if a mountain chain is not resolved in the driving 
model, the snow-albedo feedback is not represented by the bias adjustment such that local temperature trends 
in high altitudes are under-represented (Maraun et al., 2017; Cross-Chapter Box 10.2, Figure 1). It has 
therefore been suggested to account for local random variability by combining bias adjustment with 
stochastic downscaling (Volosciuk et al., 2017; Lange, 2019), although this approach still does not account 
for local modifications of the climate change signal. Two approaches have been proposed to represent these 
local changes: dynamical downscaling with high-resolution RCMs (Maraun et al., 2017) or statistical 
emulators of such (Walton et al., 2015). Sections 10.3.3.4–10.3.3.6 and 10.3.3.9 discuss other examples 
where RCMs improve the representation of regional phenomena and regional climate change. </p>

<p>Overall, there is high confidence that the use of bias adjustment for statistical downscaling, in particular to 
downscale coarse resolution global models, has severe limitations.  </p>

<h3>Bias adjustment of multiple variables</h3>

<p>Impact models, as well as indices of climatic impact-drivers, often require input of several meteorological 
variables (Chapter 12). In several situations, for example, if the dependence between the variables is not well 
simulated, univariate bias adjustment of the individual variables may increase biases in the resulting 
indicator (Zscheischler et al., 2019). A simple alternative would be a bias adjustment of the indicator, but 
such a procedure may substantially alter the climate change signal, in particular for extreme events 
(Casanueva et al., 2018). Multivariate bias adjustment methods are in principle good to adjust all statistical 
aspects of the multivariate distribution that they intend to adjust. Depending on the method, this includes the 
correlation structure or even broader aspects of the dependence (Cannon, 2016, 2018; Vrac, 2018; François 
et al., 2020). If multivariate adjustment includes a spatial dimension, then spatial dependence is adjusted well 
(Vrac, 2018), but care is needed when applied across large areas (François et al., 2020). Adjustment of 
multivariate dependence necessarily modifies the temporal sequencing of the driving model (Cannon, 2016; 
Maraun, 2016). The extent of the modification depends on the chosen method and the number of variables to 
adjust (Vrac and Friederichs, 2015; Cannon, 2016; Vrac, 2018; François et al., 2020). </p>

<h3>Bias adjustment in the presence of observational uncertainty and internal variability</h3>

<p>Observational uncertainties and internal variability introduce uncertainty in the estimation of biases and thus 
in the calibration of bias-adjustment methods. Dobor and Hlásny (2018) found a considerable influence of 
the choice of the observational dataset and calibration period on the adjustment for some regions. RCM 
biases are typically larger than observational uncertainties, but in some regions, and in particular for wet-day 
frequencies, spatial patterns and the intensity distribution of daily precipitation, the situation may reverse 
(Kotlarski et al., 2019). Switanek et al. (2017) found a strong influence of internal variability and thus of the 
choice of calibration period on the calibration of quantile mapping and on the modification of the climate 
change signal. </p>

<p>Bias adjustment is typically evaluated using cross-validation, i.e. by calibrating the adjustment function to 
one period of the observational record, and by evaluating it on a different one. Maraun et al. (2017) and 
Maraun and Widmann (2018) demonstrated that, in the presence of multi-decadal internal variability, cross-
validation may lead to a rejection of a valid bias adjustment or even lead to a positive evaluation of an 
invalid adjustment. The authors therefore argued that, in the presence of substantial internal variability, the 
evaluation of bias adjustment requires to consider aspects that have not been adjusted, such as temporal, 
spatial, or multi-variable dependence. </p>

<p>There is high confidence that observational uncertainty and internal variability adversely affect bias 
adjustment and introduce uncertainties in bias adjusted future projections. </p>

<h3>Overall assessment and new avenues</h3>

<p>In the light of these issues, several authors dismiss the use of bias adjustment for climate change studies 
(Vannitsem, 2011; Ehret et al., 2012). Ehret et al. (2012) and Stocker et al. (2015) propose to at least provide 
the raw model output alongside the adjusted data. Maraun et al. (2017b) argue that the target resolution 
should be similar to the model resolution to avoid downscaling issues. Stocker et al. (2015) and Maraun et al. 
(2017) highlighted the relevance of understanding model biases and the misrepresentations of the underlying 
physical processes prior to any adjustment. Together with Galmarini et al. (2019) , they point out the need 
for collaboration between bias adjustment users, experts in climate modelling and experts in the considered 
regional climate. As new research avenues, development of process-oriented bias adjustment methods 
(Addor et al., 2016; Verfaillie et al., 2017; Manzanas and Gutiérrez, 2019) or run-time bias adjustment 
integrated into the climate simulation, e.g., to reduce circulation errors (Guldberg et al., 2005; Kharin et al., 
2012; Krinner et al., 2019, 2020) are proposed. </p>
