<p>Projections of ice sheets and glaciers in the AR5 (Church et al., 2013a) and the SROCC (Oppenheimer et al., 
2019) were assessed by collecting single model studies (with the exception of glaciers in SROCC (Hock et 
al., 2019b)). Community benchmark experiments (ISMIP-HOM; (Pattyn et al., 2008) or Marine Ice Sheet 
Model Intercomparison Projects (MISMIP, (Pattyn et al., 2012); MISMIP3d, (Pattyn and Durand, 2013); 
MISMIP+ (Asay-Davis et al., 2016; Cornford et al., 2020)) have substantially advanced ice sheet modelling 
since the AR5. Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) now inform projections of both ice sheets and 
glaciers: the Ice Sheet MIP for CMIP6 (ISMIP6) (Section 9.4.1.3; 9.4.2.5), the Linear Antarctic Response 
MIP (LARMIP-2; Section 9.4.2.5) and GlacierMIP (Section 9.5.1.3).  </p>

<h3>Regional forcing for land ice intercomparison projects</h3>

<p>Simulations of ice sheets and glaciers are dependent on forcing provided by atmosphere and ocean 
models. Despite progress in representing processes, reducing biases and increasing resolution, regional and 
global models still have difficulties reproducing observed regional air temperature, surface mass balance and 
ocean changes (Section 9.4.1.2, 9.4.2.2, Atlas.11). Assessment of CMIP5 and CMIP6 climate models, as 
forcing for land ice models, has been undertaken (Walsh et al., 2018; Barthel et al., 2020a; Marzeion et al., 
2020; Nowicki et al., 2020b) with the aim of selecting the best available historical forcings and sampling 
potential regional future climate changes. Despite improvement in simulation of atmospheric forcing, 
persistent biases remain in CMIP5/6, which reduces the fidelity of historical and future simulations of land 
ice. </p>

<h3>ISMIP6 initial state intercomparison projects (initMIP)</h3>

<p>The ISMIP6 initial state intercomparison projects (initMIP) for the Greenland (Goelzer et al., 2018) and 
Antarctic (Seroussi et al., 2019) ice sheets were designed to understand the uncertainty in sea level 
projections resulting from the choice of initialization procedures used for projections of sea level (Nowicki et 
al., 2016). Participating modelling groups (Annex II) were free to decide on the initialization method used to 
bring ice sheet models to a present-day state with the effect of these choices captured in a control simulation 
(starting from the present day state, with no further climate forcing applied), which measures intrinsic model 
drift. Compared to the earlier SeaRISE intercomparison project (Bindschadler et al., 2013; Nowicki et al., 
2013), the modelled present day ice sheets are in closer agreement with observations and the model drift has 
been reduced (Goelzer et al., 2018; Seroussi et al., 2019). Nonetheless, historical simulations remain 
challenging for ice sheet models, due to limited ice sheet observations  prior to the satellite era and biases in 
the historical atmospheric and oceanic forcings from climate models (Nowicki and Seroussi, 2018).ISMIP6 
and LARMIP-2 therefore did not provide a protocol for the historical runs used to bring the ice sheets to 
present-day, nor criteria for sub-selecting models from the multi-model ensemble based on ability to 
reproduce  historical changes (Levermann et al., 2020a; Nowicki et al., 2020a). </p>

<h3>ISMIP6 projections for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets</h3>

<p>The ISMIP6 projection protocol (Nowicki et al., 2016, 2020a) was designed to sample the uncertainty in 
future sea level due to climate scenarios (via the use of high and low emission scenarios and multiple climate 
models), ice-ocean interactions and inland response to ice shelf collapse, and ice sheet model diversity. The 
participanting ice sheet models are listed in Annex II. For each ice sheet, forcing was selected (Barthel et al., 
2020b) from the CMIP5 (Taylor et al., 2012) and CMIP6 (Eyring et al., 2016) models. Atmospheric forcing 
fields consisted of anomalies in surface mass balance and surface air temperatures generated directly from 
the CMIP models for the Antarctic ice sheet and downscaled using the MAR regional climate model for the 
Greenland ice sheet (Hofer et al., 2020). To sample the uncertainty due to ocean forcings, models used either 
a model-specific scheme using the ISMIP6-provided oceanic dataset or a standard ISMIP6 approach. For the 
Greenland ice sheet, the oceanic dataset consists of thermal forcing (temperature minus freezing 
temperature) extrapolated into fjords and subglacial runoff. The standard approach uses timelines of 
tidewater glacier retreat (Slater et al., 2019, 2020a). For the Antarctic ice sheet, the oceanic dataset consists 
of salinity, thermal forcing and temperature added to an observationally derived climatology and 
extrapolated under ice shelves. The standard approach is a basal melt rate that depends quadratically on 
thermal forcing, adapted from Favier et al., (2019), with two different calibrations (Figure 9.19, Jourdain et 
al., 2020) that reproduce observed basal melt rates across Antarctica or Pine Island Glacier, respectively 
(Sections 9.4.2.2, 9.4.2.3). Antarctic ice shelf disintegration datasets (Nowicki et al., 2020a) assume that ice 
shelves disintegrate when annual surface melt reaches a threshold (Trusel et al., 2015).    </p>

<p>The ISMIP6 projections (Goelzer et al., 2020; Seroussi et al., 2020; Payne et al., 2021) are reported as 
experiment minus control and represent the sea level resulting from future climate change only. The control 
simulation, which has constant climate conditions starting in 2015 from the historical run, captures drift 
associated with the choices made for the initialization method and historical run. Subtraction of this control 
removes any long-term dynamic response of the ice sheet to pre-2015 climate change. This response has 
been assessed using dynamic discharge derived from observations over the last 40 years (Mouginot et al., 
2019; Rignot et al., 2019), under an assumption that it persists at the past rate until 2100 rather than 
diminishing. The dynamic response to historical forcing is estimated as 0.19 ± 0.10 mm yr-1 for the 
Greenland ice sheet (Section 9.4.1.3) and 0.33 ± 0.16 mm yr-1 for the Antarctic ice sheet (Section 9.4.2.5). 
Over the period 2015-2100, this leads to an additional sea level contribution of 1.7 cm for Greenland and 2.8 
cm for Antarctica. </p>

<h3>LARMIP-2 projections for the Antarctic ice sheet</h3>

<p>LARMIP-2 is focused on the uncertainty in the ocean forcing and associated ice shelf melting (Levermann et 
al., 2014, 2020a) with the majority of the models also participating in ISMIP6 (Annex II). The experiments 
start from present day and impose an additional basal ice shelf melting of 8 m yr-1 at the beginning of the 100 
yr simulation. A control run is used to remove drift resulting from initialization. The time derivative of the 
ice sheet response yields a linear response function, which is then convoluted with a forcing of basal shelf 
melt time series for five Antarctic regions. The forcing time series for RCP2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 were 
obtained from a random combination of global mean temperature for each RCP from MAGICC-6.0 
(Meinshausen et al., 2011), a scaling factor and time delay for the relationship between global surface air 
temperature and subsurface ocean warming in a given sector of the Southern Ocean from one of 19 CMIP5 
models (Taylor et al., 2012) and a basal melting sensitivity from the interval [7,- 16] m yr-1 ºC-1 to convert 
the regional subsurface warming into basal ice shelf melting. This process is repeated 20,000 times to obtain 
a probability distribution of the sea level contribution for five Antarctic sectors. The linear response 
framework captures complex temporal responses of the ice sheets resulting from an increase in basal ice 
shelf melting, but neglects the response to surface mass balance and any self-dampening or self-amplifying 
processes, such as MISI. The LARMIP-2 method is applied to temperature projections for the SSPs 
(Supplementary Material 7.SM.2) and an estimate of surface mass balance change from the AR5 parametric 
Antarctic ice sheet surface mass balance model (Church et al., 2013a) is added to the results (Sections 
9.4.2.4, 9.4.2.5, 9.6.3.2). It is not necessary to add a long-term dynamic response to the LARMIP-2 
projections, as this is incorporated in the basal melt time series. </p>

<h3>GlacierMIP projections</h3>

<p>GlacierMIP (Marzeion et al., 2020) was designed to estimate the glacier contribution to sea level rise, 
including from  peripheral glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica that can be considered to be dynamically 
decoupled, or entirely separate, from the ice sheets. Glacier models are described in Annex II. Initial 
conditions were based on version 6 of the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI Consortium, 2017) and initial 
ice thickness and volume were provided from an update of Huss and Farinotti, (2012) (although some glacier 
models used their own estimates). Forcings were taken from ten different CMIP5 GCMs, selected based on 
availability of multiple RCPs, the choice in a previous model intercomparison (Hock et al., 2019a), and 
performance in glacier-covered regions according to Walsh et al., (2018). In addition, two global glacier 
models performed the same experiment with thirteen CMIP6 models (Section 9.5.1.3). </p>

<h3>Use of an emulator with ISMIP6 and GlacierMIP projections</h3>

<p>The ISMIP6 and GlacierMIP projections are primarily based on a limited number of CMIP5 RCPs and 
CMIP6 SSPs, and a limited sampling of ice-ocean interaction parameters and ice shelf collapse simulations. 
Emulators provide a method for expanding these projections to a range of SSPs with more comprehensive 
sampling of climate, ice sheet and glacier modelling uncertainties. Sections 9.4.1.3, 9.4.2.5 and 9.5.1.3 show 
estimates from the emulator of (Edwards et al., 2021). This is a Gaussian Process (rather than physically-
based: Cross-Chapter Box 7.1) model derived from the ISMIP6 and GlacierMIP simulations; projections use 
distributions of GSAT from the two-layer emulator (Supplementary Material 7.SM.2) and ice sheet 
parameters as inputs, and include estimates of the emulator uncertainty. Probability intervals are therefore 
not inflated by a further factor, as is often the case for multi-model ensemble projections, to account for 
missing uncertainties (Section 9.6.3.2). The emulator is used in Section 9.6.3 to provide projections of the 
land-ice contribution to sea level that are fully consistent with each other, ocean heat content, and the 
assessed equilibrium climate sensitivity and projections of GSAT across the entire report. </p>
