<p>Following AR5, this report does not recommend an emission metric because the appropriateness of the 
choice depends on the purposes for which gases or forcing agents are being compared. Emission metrics can 
facilitate the comparison of effects of emissions in support of policy goals. They do not define policy goals 
or targets but can support the evaluation and implementation of choices within multi-component policies 
(e.g., they can help prioritise which emissions to abate). The choice of metric will depend on which aspects 
of climate change are most important to a particular application or stakeholder and over which time-
horizons. Different international and national climate policy goals may lead to different conclusions about 
what is the most suitable emission metric (Myhre et al., 2013b).  </p>

<p>GWP and GTP give the relative effect of pulse emissions, i.e. how much more energy is trapped (GWP) or 
how much warmer (GTP) the climate would be when unit emissions of different compounds are compared 
(Section 7.6.1.2). Consequently, these metrics provide information on how much energy accumulation 
(GWP) or how much global warming (GTP) could be avoided (over a given time period, or at a given future 
point in time) by avoiding the emission of a unit of a short-lived greenhouse gas compared to avoiding a unit 
of CO2. By contrast, the new metric approaches of Combined-GTP and GWP* closely approximate the 
additional effect on climate from a time-series of short-lived greenhouse gas emissions, and can be used to 
compare this to the effect on temperature from the emission or removal of a unit of CO2 (Allen et al., 2018b; 
Collins et al., 2020; Section 7.6.1.4).  </p>

<p>If global surface temperature stabilization goals are considered, cumulative CO2 equivalent emissions 
computed with the GWP-100 emission metric would continue to rise when short-lived greenhouse gas 
emissions are reduced but remain above zero (Figure 7.22b). Such as rise would not match the expected 
global surface temperature stabilization or potential decline in warming that comes from a reduction in 
emissions of short-lived greenhouse gases (Pierrehumbert, 2014; Allen et al., 2018b; Cain et al., 2019; 
Collins et al., 2020; Lynch et al., 2020, 2021). This is relevant to net zero greenhouse gas emission goals 
(See Section 7.6.2 and Chapter 1, Box 1.4).  </p>

<p>When individual gases are treated separately in climate model emulators (Cross-Chapter Box 7.1), or 
weighted and aggregated using an emission metric approach (such as CGTP or GWP*) which translate the 
distinct behaviour from cumulative emissions of short-lived gases, ambiguity in the future warming 
trajectory of a given emission scenario can be substantially reduced (Cain et al., 2019; Denison et al., 2019; 
Collins et al., 2020; Lynch et al., 2021). The degree of ambiguity varies with the emissions scenario. For 
mitigation pathways that limit warming to 2°C with an even chance, the ambiguity arising from using GWP-
100 as sole constraint on emissions of a mix of greenhouse gases (without considering their economic 
implications or feasibility) could be as much as 0.17°C, which represents about one fifth of the remaining 
global warming in those pathways (Denison et al., 2019). If the evolution of the individual GHGs are not 
known, this can make it difficult to evaluate how a given global multi-gas emission pathway specified only 
in CO2 equivalent emissions would achieve (or not) global surface temperature goals. This is potentially an 
issue as Nationally Determined Contributions frequently make commitments in terms of GWP-100 based 
CO2- equivalent emissions at 2030 without specifying individual gases (Denison et al., 2019). Clear and 
transparent representation of the global warming implications of future emission pathways including 
Nationally Determined Contributions could be achieved either by their detailing pathways for multiple gases 
or by detailing a pathway of cumulative carbon dioxide equivalent emission approach aggregated across 
greenhouse gases evaluated by either GWP* or CGTP metric approaches (Cain et al., 2019; Collins et al., 
2020; Lynch et al., 2021). Note that although the Paris Agreement Rulebook asks countries to report 
emissions of individual greenhouse gases separately for the global stocktake (Decision 18/CMA.1, annex, 
paragraph 38) which can allow the current effects of their emissions on global surface temperature to be 
accurately estimated, estimates of future warming are potentially ambiguous where emissions are aggregated 
using GWP-100 or other pulse metrics.  </p>

<p>Although there is significant history of using single-basket approaches, supported by emission metrics such 
as GWP-100, in climate policies such as the Kyoto Protocol, multi-basket approaches also have many 
precedents in environmental management, including the Montreal Protocol (Daniel et al., 2012). Further 
assessment of the performance of physical and economics-based metrics in the context of climate change 
mitigation is provided in the contribution of Working Group III to the AR6.  </p>
