<p>Aerosols affect precipitation in two major pathways, by altering the shortwave and longwave radiation and 
influencing cloud microphysical properties. </p>

<h3>Aerosol radiative effects on precipitation</h3>

<p>Aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation which reduces the energy available for surface evaporation and 
subsequent precipitation. In addition, cooling is incurred by the radiation that is reflected back to space 
directly by the aerosols and indirectly by the aerosol effect on cloud brightening. Northern Hemisphere (NH) 
station data indicate decreasing precipitation trends during 1950s-1980s, which have since partially 
recovered (Wild, 2012; Bonfils et al., 2020). These changes are attributable with high confidence to 
anthropogenic aerosol emissions from North America and Europe causing dimming through reduced surface 
solar radiation, which peaked during the late-1970s and partially recovered thereafter following improved air 
quality regulations (Section 6.2.1; Box 8.1, Figure 1).   </p>

<p>Dimming over the NH causes a relative cooling, compared to the SH, which induces a southward shift of the 
northern edge of the tropical rain belt (Allen et al., 2014; Brönnimann et al., 2015) (Section 3.3.2.2). CMIP5 
simulations show that most of the cooling is caused by the aerosol cloud-mediated effect (Chung and Soden, 
2017). Dimming also weakens monsoon flow and precipitation, offsetting or even overcoming the expected 
precipitation increase due to increased GHGs (Ayantika et al et al., 2021). The oceanic response to a 
weakened monsoon cross-equatorial flow can further weaken the South Asian monsoon through an 
amplifying feedback loop (Swapna et al., 2012; Krishnan et al., 2016; Patil et al., 2019) These processes 
partially explain (medium confidence) the southward shift of the NH tropical edge of the tropical rain belt 
from the 1950s to the 1980s (Allen et al., 2014; Brönnimann et al., 2015) and the severe drought in the Sahel 
that peaked in the mid-1980s (Rotstayn et al., 2002; Undorf et al., 2018). These processes also explain (high 
confidence) the observed decrease of southeast Asian Monsoon precipitation during the second half of the 
20th century (Bollasina et al. et al., 2011; Sanap et al., 2015; Krishnan et al., 2016; Lau and Kim, 2017; Lin et 
al., 2018; Undorf et al., 2018) (Figure 8.7).  </p>

<p>Absorption of solar radiation by anthropogenic aerosols such as black carbon warms the lower troposphere 
and increases moist static energy but also results in larger convection inhibition that suppresses light rainfall 
(Wang et al., 2013c) (Box 8.1, Figure 2). Release of aerosol-induced instability, often triggered by 
topographical barriers, produces intense rainfall, flooding (Fan et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2016) and severe 
convective storms (Saide et al., 2015) (medium confidence). In particular, aerosols induce intense convection 
at the Himalaya foothills during the pre-monsoon season, which generates a regional convergence there 
(medium confidence). This mechanism is termed the “elevated heat pump hypothesis” (Lau and Kim, 2006; 
D’Errico et al., 2015). </p>

<h3>Aerosol cloud microphysical effects</h3>

<p>Cloud droplets nucleate on pre-existing aerosol particles which act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). 
Anthropogenic aerosols add CCN, compared to a pristine background, and produce clouds with more 
numerous and smaller droplets, slower to coalesce into raindrops and to freeze into ice hydrometeors at 
temperatures below 0°C. Adding CCN suppresses light rainfall from shallow and short-lived clouds, but it is 
compensated by heavier rainfall from deep clouds. Adding aerosols to clouds in extremely clean air 
invigorates them by more efficient vapour condensation on the added drop surfaces (Koren et al., 2014; Fan 
et al., 2018). Clouds forming in more polluted air masses (hence with more numerous and smaller drops) 
need to grow deeper to initiate rain (Freud and Rosenfeld, 2012; Konwar et al., 2012; Campos Braga et al., 
2017). This leads to larger amount of cloud water evaporating aloft while cooling and moistening the air 
there at the expense of the lower levels, which leads to convective invigoration (Dagan et al., 2017; Chua 
and Ming, 2020), followed by convergence, air mass destabilization and added rainfall in an amplifying 
feedback loop (Abbott and Cronin, 2021). In addition, delaying rain initiation until greater altitudes are 
reached transports more cloud water above the 0°C altitude and leads to additional release of latent heat of 
freezing and/or vapour deposition, which in combination with the added latent heat of condensation 
enhances the cloud updrafts (Fan et al., 2018). The stronger updrafts invigorate mixed phase precipitation 
and the resultant hail and cloud electrification (Rosenfeld et al., 2008a; Thornton et al., 2017). This includes 
the outer convective rainbands of tropical cyclones and there is medium confidence that air pollution 
enhances flood hazard associated with the outer rain bands at the expense of the inner rain bands (Wang et 
al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2018a; Souri et al., 2020). </p>

<p>The aerosol effect on invigoration and rainfall from deep convective clouds peaks at moderate levels (aerosol 
optical depth of 0.2 to 0.3), but reverses into suppression with more aerosols (Liu et al., 2019a). More 
generally, the microphysical aerosol-related processes often compensate or buffer each other (Stevens and 
Feingold, 2009). For example, suppressed rain by slowing drop coalescence enhances mixed phase 
precipitation. Therefore, despite the potentially large aerosol influence on the precipitation forming 
processes, the net outcome of aerosol microphysical effects on precipitation amount has generally low 
confidence, especially when evaluated with respect to the background of high natural variability in 
precipitation (Tao et al., 2012). </p>

<p>Ice nucleating particles (INP) aerosols initiate ice precipitation from persistent supercooled water clouds that 
have cloud droplets too small for efficient warm rain, or expedite mixed phase precipitation in short lived 
supercooled rain clouds (Creamean et al., 2013). Most INP are desert and soil dust particles, rather than air 
pollution aerosols (DeMott et al., 2010). Biogenic particles from terrestrial and marine origin are more rare, 
but important at temperatures above about -15°C (Murray et al., 2012; DeMott et al., 2016). Dust particles 
from long-range transport across the Pacific were found to enhance snow forming processes over the Sierra 
Nevada in California (Creamean et al., 2013; Fan et al., 2014). The impact of INP was demonstrated by glaciogenic cloud seeding experiments, which enhanced orographic supercooled clouds with medium 
confidence of success (French et al., 2018; Rauber et al., 2019; Friedrich et al., 2020). There are still major 
gaps in understanding the effects of INP mainly on deep convective clouds (Kanji et al., 2017; Stanford et 
al., 2017; Korolev et al., 2020) </p>
