<p>This box presents an assessment of interactions between the carbon and water cycles that influence the 
dynamics of the biosphere and its interaction with the climate system. It also highlights carbon-water trade-
offs arising from the use of land-based climate mitigation options. Individual aspects of the interactions 
between the carbon and water cycles are addressed in separate chapters (Sections 5.2.1, 5.4.1, 8.2.3, 8.3.1, 
8.4.1, 11.6). The influence of wetlands and dams on methane emissions is assessed elsewhere (Sections 
5.2.2, 5.4.7, 8.3.1), as well as the consequences of permafrost thawing (Box 5.1, Section 9.5.2) and/or 
increased flooding (Sections 8.4.1, 11.5, 12.4) on wetland extent in the northern high latitudes and wet 
tropics. </p>

<h3>Does elevated CO2 alleviate the impacts of drought?</h3>

<p>Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration enhances leaf photosynthesis and drives a partial closure of leaf 
stomata, leading to higher water-use efficiency (WUE) at the leaf, canopy to ecosystem scales (Norby and 
Zak, 2011; De Kauwe et al., 2013; Fatichi et al., 2016; Knauer et al., 2017; Mastrotheodoros et al., 2017). 
Since AR5 (Box 6.3), a growing body of evidence from tree-ring and carbon isotopes further confirms an 
increase of plant water-use efficiency over decadal to centennial time scales, with some evidence for a 
stronger enhancement of photosynthesis compared to stomatal reductions (Frank et al., 2015; Guerrieri et al., 
2019; Adams et al., 2020).  </p>

<p>Multiple lines of evidence suggest that WUE has increased in near proportionality to atmospheric CO2 (high 
confidence), at a rate generally consistent with Earth System Models (ESMs), despite variation in the WUE 
response to CO2 (De Kauwe et al., 2013; Frank et al., 2015; Keeling et al., 2017; Lavergne et al., 2019; 
Walker et al., 2020). Both field-scale CO2 enrichment experiments and process models show the effect of 
physiologically induced water savings, particularly under water limiting conditions (De Kauwe et al., 2013; 
Farrior et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2016; Roy et al., 2016). Plants can also benefit from reduced drought stress due 
to enhanced CO2 without ecosystems-scale water savings (Jiang et al., 2021). This increased WUE offsets to 
some extent the effects of enhanced vapor pressure deficit (VPD) on plant transpiration (Bobich et al., 2010; 
Creese et al., 2014; Jiao et al., 2019), but will have limited effect on ameliorating plant water stress during 
extreme drought events (Xu et al., 2016; Menezes-Silva et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020b), when leaf stomata is 
governed primarily by soil moisture (Roy et al., 2016).  </p>

<p>Leaf stomata closure can have large effects on land freshwater availability because of reduced plant 
transpiration leading in some regions to higher soil moisture and runoff (Roderick et al., 2015; Milly and 
Dunne, 2016; Yang et al., 2019c). However, increased water availability is often not realized because other 
CO2 physiological effects that enhance ecosystem evapotranspiration might offset the gains. These effects 
include plant growth and leaf area expansion (Ainsworth and Long, 2005; Ukkola et al., 2016; McDermid et 
al., 2021), lengthening of the vegetative growing season (Frank et al., 2015; Lian et al., 2021), and the effects 
of stomatal closure on near-surface atmosphere that leads to increased air temperature and vapor-pressure 
deficits (Berg et al., 2016; Vogel et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2019; Grossiord et al., 2020). </p>

<p>ESMs show no consensus about the net hydrological response to physiological CO2 effects. Some studies 
show water savings as a consequence of the CO2 effects on leaf stomata closure (Swann et al., 2016; 
Lemordant et al., 2018), while other studies show that increased leaf area offsets the gains from increased 
WUE (Mankin et al., 2019). However, these projections are subject to ESM uncertainties to quantify 
transpiration  (Lian et al., 2021), among them the correct representations of plant hydraulic architecture such 
as changes in xylem anatomical properties and deep rooting (Nie et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2020b).  </p>

<p>In conclusion, it is very likely that elevated CO2 leads to increased WUE at the leaf level concurrent with 
enhanced photosynthesis. Increased CO2 concentrations alleviate the effects of water deficits on plant 
productivity (medium confidence) but there is low confidence on its role under extreme drought conditions. 
There is low confidence that increased WUE by vegetation will substantially reduce global plant 
transpiration and diminish the frequency and severity of soil moisture and streamflow deficits associated 
with the radiative effect of higher CO2 concentrations. </p>

<h3>How does drought affect the terrestrial CO2 sink?</h3>

<p>Water availability controls the spatial distribution of photosynthesis (gross primary productivity, GPP) over a 
larger part of the globe (Beer et al., 2010) and, at local scale, drought decreases GPP more than respiration 
(Schwalm et al., 2012) over most ecosystem types. This makes water availability a major climatic driver of 
variability in net ecosystem exchange (Jung et al., 2017; Humphrey et al., 2018). In addition to suppressing 
photosynthesis, field evidence suggests that droughts reduce the land CO2 sink also through increasing forest 
mortality and promoting wildfire (Allen et al., 2015; Brando et al., 2019; Abram et al., 2021).  </p>

<p>At the global scale, interannual variability in the atmospheric CO2 growth rate and global-scale terrestrial 
water storage from satellite shows that a lower global net land CO2 sink is associated with below-average 
terrestrial water storage (Humphrey et al., 2018). Atmospheric inversions based on surface and satellite 
column CO2 measurements show significant carbon release during drought events in pan-tropic areas 
(Phillips et al., 2009; Gatti et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2017a; Palmer et al., 2019a). Regional extreme droughts in 
the mid-latitudes also lead to decreased GPP and land CO2 sink  (Ciais et al., 2005; Wolf et al., 2016; Peters 
et al., 2020b; Flach et al., 2021). Droughts cannot be compensated by equivalent wet anomalies because of 
the non-linear response of the terrestrial carbon uptake to soil moisture (Green et al., 2019). </p>

<p>Uncertainties remain on the magnitude of sensitivity of the land carbon fluxes to droughts. Global studies 
indicate stronger control of soil moisture  to variations in satellite proxies of GPP than VPD (Stocker et al., 
2019; Liu et al., 2020b). However, given that VPD increases exponentially with atmospheric warming, some 
studies suggest that the importance of VPD in stomatal regulation will become increasingly more important 
under warmer climate (Novick et al., 2016; Grossiord et al., 2020). It is difficult to isolate the relative 
contributions of warmer temperature, higher VPD and lower soil moisture. This is because land-atmosphere 
feedbacks cause a simultaneous increase of plant evaporative demand and of root zone water deficit 
impairing plant root uptake (Berg et al., 2016). These physiological responses can be further compounded by 
drought legacies (Anderegg et al., 2015), changes in structure and population dynamics due to forest 
mortality (McDowell et al., 2020), disturbances associated with drought (fire, insects damage) (Anderegg et 
al., 2020) and possible trade-offs between resistance and resilience (Li et al., 2020b). Nonetheless, ESMs 
suggest that increased drought effects under very high levels of global warming (ca. 4°C at the end of the 
21st century) contribute to the reduced efficiency of the land sink (Green et al., 2019).  </p>

<p>In conclusion, there is high confidence that the global net land CO2 sink is reduced on interannual scale when 
regional-scale reductions in water availability associated with droughts occur, particularly in tropical regions. <br />
There is also high confidence that the global land sink will become less efficient due to soil moisture 
limitations and associated drought conditions in some regions for high emission scenarios, specially under 
global warming above 4°C. However, there is low confidence on how these water cycle feedbacks will play 
out in lower emission scenarios (at 2°C global warming or lower) due to uncertainties in regional rainfall 
changes and the balance between the CO2 fertilisation effect, through WUE, and the radiative impacts of 
greenhouse gases.   </p>

<h3>What are the limits of carbon dioxide removal from a water cycle perspective?</h3>

<p>Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) options based on terrestrial carbon sinks will require the appropriation of 
significant amounts of water at the landscape level. Most mitigation pathways that seek to limit global 
warming to 1.5°C or less than 2°C require the removal of about 30 to 300 GtC from the atmosphere by 2100 
(Rogelj et al., 2018b). Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and afforestation/reforestation <br />
are the dominant CDR options used in climate stabilisation scenarios implying large requirements for land 
and water (Section 5.6; (Beringer et al., 2011; Boysen et al., 2017b; Fajardy and Mac Dowell, 2017; Jans et 
al., 2018; Séférian et al., 2018b; Yamagata et al., 2018; Stenzel et al., 2019). A review of freshwater 
requirements for irrigating biomass plantations shows a range between 15 and 1250 km3 per GtC−1 of 
biomass harvest. This is equivalent to a water requirement of 99–8250 km3 for the median BECCS 
deployment of around 3.3 GtCyr−1 (Smith et al., 2016) in &lt;2°C-scenarios  (Stenzel et al., 2021), assuming 
that biomass is converted to electricity which is substantially less efficient than to heat. These large ranges 
are the result of different assumptions about the type of biomass and yield improvements, management, and 
land availability. The use of alternative feedstocks, such as wastes, residues and algae, would lead to smaller 
water requirements (Smith et al., 2019). </p>

<p>Most of the water consumed in BECCS is used to grow the feedstock, with carbon capture and storage 
constituting a smaller portion across all crops (Rosa et al., 2020), with an estimated evaporative loss of 260 
km3 yr−1 for 3.3 GtC yr−1 (Smith et al., 2016). The same authors also estimate water use for CDR through 
afforestation at 1040 km3 yr−1 for 3.3 GtC yr−1, including interception and transpiration and adjusted for the 
original land cover’s water use.  </p>

<p>The impacts of different CDR options on the water cycle depend crucially on regional climate, prior land 
cover, and scale of deployment (Trabucco et al., 2008). Extensive irrigation for afforestation in drier areas 
will have larger downstream impacts than in wetter regions with the difference in water use between the 
afforested landscapes and its previous vegetation determining the level of potential impacts on 
evapotranspiration and runoff (Jackson et al., 2005; Teuling et al., 2017). Afforestation and reforestation 
sometimes enhances precipitation through atmospheric feedbacks such as increased convection, at least in 
the tropics (Ellison et al., 2017) and the increase in precipitation can in some regions even cancel out the 
increased evapotranspiration (Li et al., 2018).  </p>

<p>In conclusion, extensive deployment of BECCS and afforestation/reforestation will require larger amounts of 
freshwater resources than used by the previous vegetation, altering the water cycle at regional scales (high 
confidence). Consequences of high water consumption on downstream uses, biodiversity, and regional 
climate depend on prior land cover, background climate conditions, and scale of deployment (high 
confidence). Therefore, a regional approach is required to determine the efficacy and sustainability of CDR 
projects.  </p>
