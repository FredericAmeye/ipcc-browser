<p>The Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) constitutes the largest glacierized region outside the poles and provides 
the headwaters for several major rivers (Sharma et al., 2019). Since the 1960s, the HKH has experienced 
significant trends in the mean and extremes of temperature and precipitation, accompanied by glacier mass 
loss and retreat, snowmelt and permafrost degradation (Yao et al., 2012a, 2012b; Azam et al., 2018; Bolch et 
al., 2019; Krishnan et al., 2019b, 2019a; Chug et al., 2020; Sabin et al., 2020). Observational uncertainty and 
lack of consistent, high-quality datasets hamper reliable assessments of climate change and model evaluation 
over several mountain areas, including the HKH (Section 10.2.2). This box assesses observed and projected 
climate change in the extended HKH (outline in Cross-Chapter Box 10.4, Figure 1a), in which we include 
the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and Pamir mountains. </p>

<h3>Temperature trends</h3>

<p>Little evidence was presented in the AR5 (IPCC, 2014) other than increased minimum and maximum 
temperature trends in the western Himalaya (Hartmann et al., 2013). SROCC assessed that HKH (named 
High Mountain Asia) surface-air temperature has warmed more rapidly than the global mean over recent 
decades (high confidence). Annual mean HKH surface air temperature increased significantly (about 0.1°C 
per decade) over 1901–2014 (Ren et al., 2017), although Cross-Chapter Box 10.4, Figure 1d shows an 
observational range of 0.20–0.25°C per decade over 1961–2014. There is a rising trend of extreme warm 
events and fewer extreme cold events over 1961–2015 (Krishnan et al., 2019b; Wester et al., 2019). 
However, summer cooling over the Karakoram (western HKH) was reported for 1960–2010 (Forsythe et al., 
2017). A key relevant process is elevation-dependent warming (EDW; reviewed in Pepin et al., 2015), 
leading to warming of 2–2.5°C at 5000m over 1961–2006, but only 0.5°C at sea level (Xu et al., 2016). 
However, EDW behaviour appears to depend on region, time period and elevation (Guo et al., 2019a; Li et 
al., 2020a) and understanding is limited by the sparse observational network (You et al., 2020). 
Observational and model analyses have attributed EDW to GHG and black carbon emissions, accelerating 
warming by snow-albedo feedback (Ming et al., 2012; Gautam et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2016; 
Lau and Kim, 2018; Zhang et al., 2018b), or the more pronounced cooling effect of scattering aerosols at low 
elevations and stratospheric ozone depletion (Guo and Wang, 2012; Zeng et al., 2015). There is high 
confidence that the eastern and central HKH has exhibited rising temperatures (Cross-Chapter Box 10.4, 
Figure 1), with warming dependent on season and elevation. There is high confidence that much of the 
warming can be attributed to GHGs, but the effect of albedo has only medium confidence. There is high 
confidence in more frequent extreme warm events and fewer extreme cold events over the eastern Himalayas 
in the last five decades. </p>

<h3>Precipitation trends</h3>

<p>Annual and summer precipitation over the central-eastern HKH show decreasing trends over 1979–2010 in 
multiple observed datasets, attributable to a weakening South Asian monsoon (Yao et al., 2012b; Palazzi et 
al., 2013; Roxy et al., 2015). There are contradictory trends in the western HKH (Azmat et al., 2017; Yadav 
et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018b; Meher et al., 2018), where most precipitation is associated with western 
disturbances on the subtropical westerly jet, but trends in western disturbance activity are unclear (Kumar et 
al., 2015; Hunt et al., 2019; Krishnan et al., 2019a). There has been an increased frequency and intensity of 
extreme precipitation over the central-western HKH but contrasting evidence in the east (Sheikh et al., 2015; 
Talchabhadel et al., 2018). The number of consecutive wet days has increased over 1961–2012, but with no 
uniform trend in consecutive dry days (Zhan et al., 2017). There is medium confidence that the eastern-
central HKH has experienced decreased summer precipitation (Section 10.6.3). There is medium confidence 
in the increase of summer extreme precipitation over the western HKH.  </p>

<h3>Glacier trends</h3>

<p>The SROCC assessed that snow cover has declined in duration, depth and accumulated mass at lower 
elevations in mountain regions, including the HKH (high confidence). Glaciers are losing mass (very high 
confidence) and permafrost is warming (high confidence) over high mountains in recent decades, and it is 
very likely that atmospheric warming is the main driver. A significant reduction in HKH glacier area has 
been observed since the 1970s, with smaller glaciers generally shrinking faster (e.g., Bolch et al., 2019). 
HKH glacier mass loss took place at the lowest rate among high mountain areas in the last 20 years, although 
with one of the largest total losses (Shean et al., 2020; Section 9.5.1.1; Figure 9.20). The highest mass-loss 
rates occurred in the eastern and northern HKH, while gains occurred in the west (e.g., Shean et al., 2020). 
Glacier mass gain has been coined as the “Karakoram anomaly” (Sections 9.5.1 and Section 8.3.1.7.1), 
explained by a combination of low temperature sensitivity of debris-covered glaciers, a decrease in summer 
air temperatures, and increased snowfall possibly linked to evapotranspiration from irrigated agriculture 
(You et al., 2017; Bolch et al., 2019; de Kok et al., 2020a; Farinotti et al., 2020). Meanwhile, increased air 
temperature and decreased snowfall explain the glacier mass decrease elsewhere (Bonekamp et al., 2019; de 
Kok et al., 2020b; Farinotti et al., 2020; Shean et al., 2020). There is high confidence that glaciers in most 
HKH regions have thinned, retreated and lost mass since the 1970s. </p>

<h3>Projections</h3>

<p>In AR5, the HKH was projected to continue warming over the 21st century, faster than the likely ranges for 
the global mean and South Asia. New CMIP5 results show temperature increases across mountainous HKH 
by about 1–2°C (in some places in summer 4–5°C) during 2021–2050 compared to 1961–1990 (Shrestha et 
al., 2015). Projected warming differs by up to 1°C between east and west, with higher values in winter 
(Sanjay et al., 2017; see Interactive Atlas). Statistically significant mean warming (0.30–0.90°C per decade 
until the end of the 21st century) across all RCPs has been projected by CORDEX South Asia (Dimri et al., 
2018). CMIP6 models report that northwestern South Asia, including the western Himalayas, are projected 
to experience temperature increases exceeding 6°C by the end of the 21st century under SSP5-8.5 relative to 
1995–2014 (Almazroui et al., 2020c). Results from CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX ensembles for different 
warming levels are shown in the Interactive Atlas and summarised in Figure Atlas.20. The HKH will likely 
continue warming in the coming decades.  </p>

<p>(IPCC, 2018b) stated that heavy precipitation risk in high-elevation regions is projected to be higher at 2°C 
compared to 1.5°C of global warming (medium confidence). CMIP5 models project increased annual or 
summer monsoon precipitation over the HKH in the 21st century (Palazzi et al., 2015; Kitoh and Arakawa, 
2016), intensifying by about 22% in the hilly south-eastern Himalaya and TP for the long term in RCP8.5, 
but with no trends in the western HKH (Rajbhandari et al., 2015; Krishnan et al., 2019a). CMIP6 projects an 
increase of winter precipitation over the western Himalayas, with a corresponding decrease in the east 
(Almazroui et al., 2020c). HKH projections are subject to large uncertainties in CMIP5 and CORDEX 
(Hasson et al., 2013, 2017; Mishra, 2015; Sanjay et al., 2017). CORDEX, in particular, has inherent 
limitations at reproducing the characteristics of summer monsoon rainfall variability (Singh et al., 2017). 
There is medium confidence that HKH precipitation will increase in the coming decades.  </p>

<p>The SROCC assessed that glaciers will lose substantial mass (high confidence) and permafrost will undergo 
increasing thaw and degradation (very high confidence) over high mountain regions (including the HKH), 
with stronger changes for higher emission scenarios. Regional differences in warming and precipitation 
projections and glacier properties cause considerable differences in glacier response within High Mountain 
Asia (Kraaijenbrink et al., 2017). Glacier mass loss will accelerate through the 21st century, increasing with 
RCP after 2030 (Marzeion et al., 2014; Section 9.5.1.3). Loss of between 40 ± 25% to 69 ± 21 % of 2015 
glacier volume is expected by 2100 in RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, respectively (Section 9.5.1.3; Figure 9.21). 
Glacier mass loss is expected due to decreased snowfall, increased snowline elevations and longer melt 
seasons. However, due to projection uncertainties, simplicity of the models, and limited observations, there 
is medium confidence in the magnitude and timing of glacier mass changes (Section 9.5.1.3). Glacier mass in 
HKH will decline through the 21st century (high confidence), more so under high-emissions scenarios.  </p>
