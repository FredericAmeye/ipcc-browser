<p>Since AR5, further modelling work has been conducted on aerosol-based solar radiation modification (SRM) 
options such as stratospheric aerosol injection, marine cloud brightening, and cirrus cloud thinning18 and 
their climate and biogeochemical effects. These investigations have consistently shown that SRM could 
offset some of the effects of increasing GHGs on global and regional climate, including the carbon and water 
cycles (high confidence). However, there would be substantial residual or overcompensating climate change 
at the regional scales and seasonal time scales (high confidence), and large uncertainties associated with 
aerosol–cloud–radiation interactions persist. The cooling caused by SRM would increase the global land and 
ocean CO2 sinks (medium confidence), but this would not stop CO2 from increasing in the atmosphere or 
affect the resulting ocean acidification under continued anthropogenic emissions (high confidence). It is 
likely that abrupt water cycle changes will occur if SRM techniques are implemented rapidly. A sudden and 
sustained termination of SRM in a high CO2 emissions scenario would cause rapid climate change (high 
confidence). However, a gradual phase-out of SRM combined with emission reduction and CDR would 
avoid these termination effects (medium confidence). {4.6.3, 5.6.3. 6.4.6, 8.6.3}. </p>

<p>Solar radiation modification (SRM) refers to deliberate large-scale climate intervention options that are 
studied as potential supplements to deep mitigation, for example, in scenarios that overshoot climate 
stabilization goals. SRM options aim to offset some of the warming effects of GHG emissions by 
modification of the Earth’s shortwave radiation budget. Following SR1.5, the SRM assessed in this report 
also includes some options, such as cirrus cloud thinning, that alter the longwave radiation budget. SRM 
contrasts with climate change mitigation activities, such as emission reductions and CDR, as it introduces a 
‘mask’ to the climate change problem by altering the Earth’s radiation budget, rather than attempting to 
address the root cause of the problem, which is the increase in GHGs in the atmosphere. By masking only 
the climate effects of GHG emissions, SRM does not address other issues related to atmospheric CO2 
increase, such as ocean acidification. The WGI report assesses physical understanding of the Earth system 
response to proposed SRM and is based primarily on idealized climate model simulations. There are 
important other considerations, such as risk to human and natural systems, perceptions, ethics, cost, 
governance, and trans-boundary issues and their relationship to the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals—issues that the WGII (Chapter 16) and WGIII (Chapter 14) reports address. {4.6.3} </p>

<p>SRM options include those that increase surface albedo, brighten marine clouds by increasing the amount of 
cloud condensation nuclei, or reduce the optical depth of cirrus clouds by seeding them with ice nucleating 
particles. However, the most commonly studied approaches attempt to mimic the cooling effects of major 
volcanic eruptions by injecting reflective aerosols (e.g., sulphates) or their precursors (e.g., sulphur dioxide) 
into the stratosphere. {4.6.3, 5.6.3, 6.4.6} </p>

<p>SRM could offset some effects of greenhouse gas-induced warming on global and regional climate, but there 
would be substantial residual and overcompensating climate change at the regional scale and seasonal time 
scales (high confidence). Since the AR5, more modelling work has been conducted with more sophisticated 
treatment of aerosol-based SRM approaches, but the uncertainties in cloud–aerosol–radiation interactions are 
still large (high confidence). Modelling studies suggest that it is possible to stabilize multiple large-scale 
temperature indicators simultaneously by tailoring the deployment strategy of SRM options (medium 
confidence) but with large residual or overcompensating regional and seasonal climate changes. {4.6.3} </p>

<p>SRM approaches targeting shortwave radiation are likely to reduce global mean precipitation, relative to 
future CO2 emissions scenarios, if all global mean warming is offset. In contrast, cirrus cloud thinning, 
targeting longwave radiation, is expected to cause an increase in global mean precipitation (medium 
confidence). If shortwave approaches are used to offset global mean warming, the magnitude of reduction in 
regional precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P-E) (Box TS.5), which is more relevant to freshwater 
availability, is smaller than precipitation decrease because of simultaneous reductions in both precipitation 
and evapotranspiration (medium confidence). {4.6.3, 8.2.1, 8.6.3}.  </p>

<p>If SRM is used to cool the planet, it would cause a reduction in plant and soil respiration and slow the 
reduction of ocean carbon uptake due to warming (medium confidence). The result would be an enhancement 
of the global land and ocean CO2 sinks (medium confidence) and a slight reduction in atmospheric CO2 
concentration relative to unmitigated climate change. However, SRM would not stop CO2 from increasing in 
the atmosphere or affect the resulting ocean acidification under continued anthropogenic emissions (high 
confidence). {5.6.3}  </p>

<p>The effect of stratospheric aerosol injection on global temperature and precipitation is projected by models to 
be detectable after one to two decades, which is similar to the time scale for the emergence of the benefits of 
emissions reductions. A sudden and sustained termination of SRM in a high GHG emissions scenario would 
cause rapid climate change and a reversal of the SRM effects on the carbon sinks (high confidence). It is also 
likely that a termination of strong SRM would drive abrupt changes in the water cycle globally and 
regionally, especially in the tropical regions by shifting the ITCZ and Hadley cells. At the regional scale, 
non-linear responses cannot be excluded, due to changes in evapotranspiration. However, a gradual phase-
out of SRM combined with emissions reductions and CDR would avoid larger rates of changes (medium 
confidence). {4.6.3, 5.6.3, 8.6.3}. </p>
