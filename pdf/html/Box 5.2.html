<p>Methodological advancements since the IPCC AR5 (Collins et al., 2013; IPCC, 2013; Clarke et al., 2014; 
IPCC, 2014; Stocker et al., 2013) result in an updated and strengthened assessment of remaining carbon 
budgets. Methods and approaches at the time of AR5 are described in Section 5.5.2.1. Since AR5, strengths 
and weaknesses of various approaches have been more clearly articulated in the literature (e.g., in (Rogelj et 
al., 2016; Millar et al., 2017a; Tokarska and Gillett, 2018; Matthews et al., 2020)), resulting in a new 
consolidated framework applied in SR1.5 (Rogelj et al., 2018b, 2019) that is also used in AR6. This 
framework incorporates five methodological advancements compared to AR5, the implications of which are 
discussed in this box.  </p>

<p>First, publications since AR5 applied methods that limit the effect of uncertainties in historical, diagnosed 
emissions in coupled Earth system models on estimates of the remaining carbon budget (Millar et al., 2017a; 
Tokarska and Gillett, 2018). These new methods express remaining carbon budget estimates relative to a 
recent reference period instead of relative to pre-industrial (Millar et al., 2017a; Tokarska et al., 2019a). 
Estimates of the full carbon budget since pre-industrial can still be obtained by adding estimates of historical 
CO2 emissions (Table 5.1) to estimates in Table 5.8. This methodological update resulted, all other aspects 
being equal, in median estimates of remaining carbon budgets being about 350–450 GtCO2 larger compared 
to AR5 (IPCC, 2014; Millar et al., 2017a).  </p>

<p>At the time of the AR5, CMIP5 (Taylor et al., 2012) provided global mean surface air temperature (GSAT) 
projections for the representative concentration pathways (Meinshausen et al., 2011b), which were used to 
determine carbon budgets while taking into account the effects of non-CO2 forcers (Stocker et al., 2013c). 
Their use came with two recognised limitations: first, the model spread of the CMIP5 ensemble represents an 
ensemble of opportunity with limited statistical value (Tebaldi and Knutti, 2007); and second, the evolution 
of non-CO2 emissions as a function of cumulative CO2 emissions can differ markedly between high and low 
emissions pathways (Meinshausen et al., 2011a; Rogelj et al., 2016; Friedlingstein et al., 2014; Matthews et 
al., 2017). Solutions to these two limitations have been published since AR5 and represent the second and 
third methodological improvement compared to AR5.  </p>

<p>The reliance on an ensemble of opportunity (i.e. a serendipitous collection of scenario data from a variety of 
sources and studies) is avoided by methodologically separating the assessment of future warming 
contributions of non-CO2 emissions from the spread in TCRE (Rogelj et al., 2018b, 2019) (see Section 
5.5.2). This facilitates the explicit representation of TCRE uncertainty by a formal distribution, in this case a 
normal distribution with a 1.0–2.3°C PgC<sup>-1</sup> 1–sigma range (Section 5.5.1.4). The effect of this 
methodological advance can be estimated from a direct comparison of the frequency distribution of TCRE in 
CMIP5 models that were used in AR5 and the formal TCRE distribution used in AR6, but is limited in 
precision. For estimates of the remaining carbon budget in line with limiting warming to 1.5°C or 2°C 
relative to pre-industrial levels, this improvement is estimated to lead to a reduction of budgets of the order 
of about 100 GtCO2 between AR5 and AR6.  </p>

<p>The third methodological improvement is a more direct estimation of the warming contribution of non-CO2 
emissions, consistent with pathways that bring global CO2 emissions down to net zero. Instead of deriving 
this contribution implicitly from the CMIP5 ensemble, climate emulators (Meinshausen et al., 2011c; 
Schwarber et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2018b) that are calibrated to the combined AR6 assessment (Cross-
Chapter Box 7.1) are used to estimate the non-CO2 contribution across a wide variety of stringent mitigation scenarios (Huppmann et al., 2018). The specific relative effect of this advance compared to AR5 is not 
calculable because CMIP5 data does not isolate non-CO2 from CO2-induced warming.  </p>

<p>The fourth and fifth methodological advancements are to explicitly account for the zero-emission 
commitment (ZEC, Section 5.5.2.2.4) and adjust estimates for Earth system feedbacks that are typically not 
represented in Earth System models (Section 5.5.2.2.5). The central estimate of the assessed ZEC used in 
SR1.5 and AR6 is zero (Sections 4.7.2). ZEC uncertainties are reported separately (Table 5.8), and the 
additional consideration of ZEC therefore does result in a better understanding but not in a net shift of central 
estimates of the remaining carbon budget compared to AR5. Furthermore, AR5 did not explicitly account for 
Earth system feedbacks not represented in Earth system models. SR1.5 assessed that they could reduce the 
remaining carbon budgets by about 100 GtCO2 over centennial timescales. This assessment has been updated 
in AR6, including a wider range of biogeochemical feedbacks and new evidence (Section 5.5.2.2.5). Some of 
these feedbacks are captured in the estimation of non-CO2 warming (see below), while the combined effect 
of remaining positive and negative feedbacks is assessed to reduce the remaining carbon budget estimates by 
7 ± 27 PgC K<sup>-1</sup> (1-sigma range, or 26 ± 97 GtCO2 °C<sup>-1</sup>) compared to AR5.  </p>

<p>Between SR1.5 and AR6, each of the five components described in Section 5.5.2.1 and Figure 5.32 have 
been re-assessed (see Sections 5.5.2.2.1 to 5.5.2.2.5). Their updated assessments in turn affect the assessment 
of the remaining carbon budget. The new and narrower assessment of TCRE in AR6 compared to SR1.5 
(likely range of 1.0–2.3°C EgC<sup>-1</sup> compared to 0.8–2.5°C EgC<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, with the same central estimate) 
leads to no change in median estimates and about a 50 and 100 GtCO2 increase in remaining carbon budgets 
estimates at the 67th percentile in AR6 compared to SR1.5 for 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming, 
respectively.  </p>

<p>For historical warming, SR1.5 used GSAT increase between 1850–1900 and 2006–2015 of 0.97°C as its 
main starting point, while also providing values for other temperature metrics. Remaining carbon budgets 
were expressed starting from 1 January 2018 by accounting for historical emissions emitted from 1 January 
2011 until the end of 2017. AR6 uses anthropogenic (human-induced) warming until the 2010–2019 period, 
which is assessed at the 0.8-1.3°C range, with a best estimate of 1.07°C (Table 3.1), and subsequently 
accounts for historical emissions from 1 January 2015 until the end of 2019 to express remaining carbon 
budget estimates from 1 January 2020 onwards. The human-induced warming between the 1850–1900 and 
2006–2015 periods used in SR1.5 was assessed by AR6 at 0.97°C (Table 3.1). In a like-with-like 
comparison, the combined effect of data and methodological updates in historical warming estimates thus 
results in no shift in estimated remaining carbon budgets between SR1.5 and AR6. However, the emissions 
of the years passed since SR1.5 reduce the remaining carbon budget by about 85 GtCO2. Note that AR6 also 
updated its GSAT assessment for total warming between the 1850–1900 and 2006–2015 periods, reporting 
0.94°C of warming. On a like-with-like basis, this would have resulted in slightly larger remaining carbon 
budgets compared to SR1.5 (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3).  </p>

<p>The non-CO2 contribution to future warming in emissions scenarios (Huppmann et al., 2018) is re-assessed 
with AR6-calibrated emulators, in this case MAGICC7 (Meinshausen et al., 2009, 2011a, 2020) (Cross-
Chapter Box 7.1). The re-assessment of non-CO2 warming with MAGICC7 results in a relationship that 
closely matches the average relationship applied in SR1.5 (shown in Section 2.SM.1.1.2 in (Forster et al., 
2018)), and does therefore not change estimates of the remaining carbon budget relative to SR1.5. The 
median ZEC assessment remained the same between SR1.5 and AR6, and therefore also does not change the 
median remaining carbon budget estimates. Finally, as indicated above, AR6 expanded the assessment of 
Earth system feedbacks compared to SR1.5 and included it in its central remaining carbon budget estimates. 
Some feedbacks are accounted for through the non-CO2 warming estimate (Section 5.5.2.2.5), while the 
remainder combines to reduce the median remaining carbon budget estimates for 1.5°C and 2°C of warming 
by about 10 to 20 GtCO2, respectively, compared to SR1.5. </p>

<p>All methodological improvements and new evidence combined result in median and 67th percentile 
remaining carbon budget estimates for limiting warming to 1.5°C being about 300–350 GtCO2 larger 
compared to an assessment that would use the evidence and methods available at the time of the AR5. For 
limiting warming to 2°C, the difference is about 400–500 GtCO2. Since SR1.5, fewer key advancements had to be integrated. In a like-with-like comparison, the combined effects of all AR6 updates result in median 
remaining carbon budget estimates for limiting warming to 1.5°C and 2°C being the same and about 60 
GtCO2 smaller, respectively, in AR6 compared to SR1.5. At the 67th percentile, remaining carbon budget 
estimates for limiting warming to 1.5°C and 2°C are about 40 to 60 GtCO2 larger, respectively, mainly as a 
result of a narrower assessed TCRE range.  </p>
