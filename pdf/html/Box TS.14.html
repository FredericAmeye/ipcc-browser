<p>With global warming, urban areas and cities will be affected by more frequent occurrence of extreme climate 
events,  such  as  heatwaves,  with  more  hot  days  and  warm  nights  as  well  as  sea  level  rise  and  increases  in 
tropical cyclone storm surge and rainfall intensity that will increase the probability of coastal city flooding 
(high confidence). {Box 10.3, 11.3, 11.5, 12.3, 12.4} </p>

<p>Urban areas have special interactions with the climate system, for instance in terms of heat islands and altering 
the  water  cycle,  and  thereby  will  be  more  affected  by  extreme  climate  events  such  as  extreme  heat  (high 
confidence). With global warming, increasing relative sea level compounded by increasing tropical cyclone 
storm surge and rainfall intensity will increase the probability of coastal city flooding (high confidence). Arctic 
coastal  settlements  are  particularly  exposed  to  climate  change  due  to  sea  ice  retreat  (high  confidence). 
Improvements in urban climate modelling and climate monitoring networks have contributed to understanding 
the  mutual  interaction  between  regional  and  urban  climate  (high  confidence).  {Box  10.3,  11.3,  11.5,  12.3, 
12.4} </p>

<p>Despite  having  a  negligible  effect  on  global  surface  temperature  (high  confidence),  urbanization  has 
exacerbated the effects of global warming through its contribution to the observed warming trend in and near 
cities, particularly in annual mean minimum temperature (very high confidence) and increases in mean and 
extreme precipitation over and downwind of the city, especially in the afternoon and early evening (medium 
confidence). {2.3, Box 10.3, 11.3, 11.4, 12.3, 12.4} </p>

<p>Combining climate change projections with urban growth scenarios, future urbanization will amplify (very 
high confidence) the projected local air temperature increase, particularly by strong influence on minimum 
temperatures,  which  is  approximately  comparable  in  magnitude  to  global  warming  (high  confidence). </p>

<p>Compared to present day, large implications are expected from the combination of future urban development 
and more frequent occurrence of extreme climate events, such as heatwaves, with more hot days and warm 
nights adding to heat stress in cities (very high confidence). {Box 10.2, 11.3, 12.4} </p>

<p>Both sea levels and air temperatures are projected to rise in most coastal settlements (high confidence). There 
is  high  confidence  in  an  increase  in  pluvial  flood  potential  in  urban  areas  where  extreme  precipitation  is 
projected to increase, especially at high global warming levels. {11.4, 11.5, 12.4} </p>
