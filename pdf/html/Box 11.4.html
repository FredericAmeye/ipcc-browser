<p>Occurrence of concurrent or near-concurrent extremes in different parts of a region, or in different locations 
around the world challenges adaptation and risk management capacity. This can occur as a result of natural 
climate variability, as climates in different parts of the world are inter-connected through teleconnections. In 
addition, in a warming climate, the probability of having several locations being affected simultaneously by 
e.g. hot extremes and heat waves increases strongly as a function of global warming, with detectable changes 
even for changes as small as +0.5°C of additional global warming (Sections 11.2.5 and 11.3, Cross-chapter 
Box 11.1). Recent articles have highlighted the risks associated with concurrent extremes over large spatial 
scales (e.g. Lehner and Stocker, 2015; Boers et al., 2019; Gaupp et al., 2019). There is evidence that such 
global-scale extremes associated with hot temperature extremes are increasing in occurrence (Sippel et al., 
2015; Vogel et al., 2019). Hereafter, the focus is on two recent global-scale events that featured concurrent 
extremes in several regions across the world. The first focuses on concurrent extremes driven by variability 
in tropical Pacific SSTs associated with the 2015-2016 extreme El Niño, while the second is a case study of 
the impacts of global warming combined with abnormal atmospheric circulation patterns in the 2018 boreal 
spring/summer.  </p>

<h3>The extreme El Niño in 2015-2016</h3>

<p>El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is one of the phenomena that have the ability to bring multitudes of 
extremes in different parts of the world, especially in the extreme cases of El Niño (Annex VI.4). 
Additionally, the background climate warming associated with greenhouse gas forcing can significantly 
exacerbate extremes in parts of the world even under normal El Niño conditions. The 2015-2016 El Niño 
event was one of the three extreme El Nino events since 1980s since the availability of satellite rainfall 
observations. According to some measures, it was the strongest El Niño over the past 145 years (Barnard et 
al., 2017). The 2015-2016 warmth was unprecedented at the central equatorial Pacific (Niño4: 5°N–5°S, 
150°E–150°W) and this exceptional warmth was unlikely to have occurred entirely naturally, appearing to 
reflect an anthropogenically forced trend (Newman et al., 2018)). In particular, its signal was seen in very 
high monthly Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST) values in late 2015 and early 2016, contributing to 
the highest record of GMST in 2016 (Section 2.3.1.1). Both the ENSO amplitude and the frequency of high-
magnitude events since 1950 is higher than over the pre-industrial period (medium confidence; Section 
2.4.2), suggesting that global extremes similar to those associated with the 2015-2016 El Niño would occur 
more frequently under further increases in global warming. Hereafter, the 2015-2016 El Niño event is 
referred to as “the 2015-2016 extreme El Niño” (Annex VI.4.1). A brief summary of extreme events that 
happened in 2015-2016 is provided in Section 6.2.2, 6.5.1.1 of the Special Report on the Ocean and 
Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC’s). We provide some highlights illustrating extremes that 
occurred in different parts of the world during the 2015-2016 extreme El Niño in BOX11.4-Table 1, as well 
as a short summary hereafter. </p>

<p>Several regions were strongly affected by droughts in 2015, including Indonesia, Australia, the Amazon 
region, Ethiopia, Southern Africa, and Europe. As a result, global measurements of land water anomalies 
were particularly low in that year (Humphrey et al., 2018). In 2015, Indonesia experienced a severe drought 
and forest fire causing pronounced impact on economy, ecology and human health due to haze crisis (Field 
et al., 2016; Huijnen et al., 2016; Patra et al., 2017; Hartmann et al., 2018). The northern part of Australia 
experienced high temperatures and low precipitation between late 2015 and early 2016, and the extensive 
mangrove trees were damaged along the Gulf of Carpentaria in northern Australia (Duke et al., 2017). The 
Amazon region experienced the most intense droughts of this century in 2015-2016. This drought was more 
severe than the previous major droughts that occurred in the Amazon in 2005 and 2010 (Lewis et al., 2011; 
Erfanian et al., 2017; Panisset et al., 2018). The 2015-2016 Amazon drought impacted the entirety of South 
America north of 20°S during the austral spring and summer (Erfanian et al., 2017). It also increased forest 
fire incidence by 36% compared to the preceding 12 years (Aragão et al., 2018) and as a consequence, 
increased the biomass burning outbreaks and the carbon monoxide (CO) concentration in the area, affecting 
air quality (Ribeiro et al., 2018). This out-of-season drought affected the water availability for human 
consumption and agricultural irrigation and it also left rivers with very low water levels, without conditions 
of ship transportation, due to large sandbanks, preventing the arrival of food, medicines, and fuels (INMET, 
2017). Eastern African countries were impacted by drought in 2015. It was found that the drought in 
Ethiopia, which was the worst in several decades, was associated with the 2015-2016 extreme El Niño that 
developed early in the year (Blunden and Arndt, 2016; Philip et al., 2018b). It was suggested that 
anthropogenic warming contributed to the 2015 Ethiopian and southern African droughts by increasing SSTs 
and local air temperatures (Funk et al., 2016, 2018b; Yuan et al., 2018a). It has also been suggested that the 
2015-2016 extreme El Niño affected circulation patterns in Europe during the 2015-2016 winter (Geng et al., 
2017; Scaife et al., 2017).  </p>

<p>It was identified that 2015 was a year of a particularly high CO2 growth rate, possibly related to some of the 
mentioned droughts, in particular in Indonesia and the Amazon region, leading to higher CO2 release in 
combination with less CO2 uptake from land areas (Humphrey et al., 2018). The impact of the 2015-2016 
extreme El Niño on vegetation systems via drought was also shown from satellite data (Kogan and Guo, 
2017). Overall, tropical forests were a carbon source to the atmosphere during the 2015–2016 El Niño–
related drought, with some estimates suggesting that up to 2.3 PgC were released (Brando et al., 2019). </p>

<p>The 2015-2016 extreme El Niño has induced extreme precipitation in some regions. Severe rainfall events 
were observed in Chennai city in India in Devember 2015 and Yangtze river region in China in June-July 
2016, and it was shown that these rainfall events are partly attributed to the 2015-2016 extreme El Niño (van 
Oldenborgh et al., 2016; Boyaj et al., 2018; Sun and Miao, 2018; Yuan et al., 2018b; Zhou et al., 2018).  </p>

<p>In 2015, the activity of tropical cyclones was notably high in the North Pacific (Blunden and Arndt, 2016). 
Over the western North Pacific, the number of category 4 and 5 Tropical Cyclones (TCs) was 13, which is 
more than twice its typical annual value of 6.3 (Zhang et al., 2016a). Similarly, a record-breaking number of 
TCs was observed in the eastern North Pacific, particularly in the western part of that domain (Collins et al., 
2016; Murakami et al., 2017a). These extraordinary TC activities were related to the average SST anomaly 
during that year, which were associated with the 2015-2016 extreme El Niño and the positive phase of the 
Pacific Meridional Mode (PMM) (Murakami et al., 2017a; Hong et al., 2018; Yamada et al., 2019). 
However, it has been suggested that the intense TC activities in both the western and the eastern North 
Pacific in 2015 were not only due to the El Niño, but also to a contribution of anthropogenic forcing 
(Murakami et al., 2017a; Yang et al., 2018d). The impact of the Indian Ocean SST also was suggested to 
contribute to the extreme TC activity in the western North Pacific in 2015 (Zhan et al., 2018). In contrast, in 
Australia, it was the least active TC season since satellite records began in 1969-70 (Blunden and Arndt, 
2017). </p>

<h3>Global-scale temperature extremes and concurrent precipitation extremes in boreal 2018 spring and summer</h3>

<p>In the 2018 boreal spring-summer season (May-August), wide areas of the mid-latitudes in the Northern 
Hemisphere experienced heat extremes and in part enhanced drought (Kornhuber et al., 2019; Vogel et al., 
2019; Box 11.3, Figure 2). The reported impacts included the following (Vogel et al., 2019): 90 deaths from 
heat strokes in Quebec (Canada), 1469 deaths from heat strokes in Japan (Shimpo et al., 2019a), 48 heat-
related deaths in South Korea (Min et al., 2020), heat warning affecting 90,000 students in the USA, fires in 
numerous countries (Canada (British Columbia), USA (California), Lapland, Latvia), crop losses in the UK, 
Germany and Switzerland (Vogel et al., 2019) and overall in central and northern Europe (leading to yield 
reductions of up to 50% for the main crops; Toreti et al., 2019), fish deaths in Switzerland, and melting of 
roads in the Netherlands and the UK, among others. In addition to the numerous hot and dry extremes, an 
extremely heavy rainfall event occurred over wide areas of Japan from 28 June to 8 July 2018 (Tsuguti et al., 
2018), which was followed by a heat wave (Shimpo et al., 2019b). The heavy precipitation event caused 
more than 230 deaths in Japan, and was named as “the Heavy Rain Event of July 2018”.  </p>

<p>The heavy precipitation event was characterized by unusually widespread and persistent rainfall and locally 
anomalous total precipitation led by band-shaped precipitation systems, which are frequently associated with 
heavy precipitation events in East Asia (Kato, 2020; Section 11.7.3). The extreme rainfall in Japan was 
caused by anomalous moisture transport with a combination of abnormal jet condition (Takemi and Unuma, 
2019; Takemura et al., 2019; Tsuji et al., 2019; Yokoyama et al., 2020), which can be viewed as an 
atmospheric river (Yatagai et al., 2019; Sections 8.2.2.8, 11.7.2) caused by intensified inflow velocity and 
high SST around Japan (Kawase et al., 2019; Sekizawa et al., 2019).  </p>

<p>This precipitation event and the subsequent heat wave are related to abnormal condition of the jet and North 
Pacific Subtropical High in this month (Shimpo et al., 2019a; Ren et al., 2020), which caused extreme 
conditions from Europe, Eurasia, and North America (Kornhuber et al., 2019; Box 11.4, Figure 2). A role of 
Atlantic SST anomaly on the meandering jets and the subtropical high have been suggested (Liu et al., 
2019a). These dynamic and thermodynamic components generally have substantial influence on extreme 
rainfall in East Asia (Oh et al., 2018), but it is under investigation whether these factors were due to 
anthropogenic forcing. </p>

<p><figref>Box 11.4,Figure2</figref> </p>

<p>Regarding the hot extremes that occurred across the Northern Hemisphere in the 2018 boreal May-July time 
period, Vogel et al. (2019) found that the event was unprecedented in terms of the total area affected by hot 
extremes (on average about 22% of populated and agricultural areas in the Northern Hemisphere) for that 
period, but was consistent with a +1°C climate which was the estimated global mean temperature anomaly 
around that time (for 2017; SR1.5). This study also found that events similar to the 2018 May-July 
temperature extremes would approximately occur 2 out of 3 years under +1.5°C of global warming, and 
every year under +2°C of global warming. Imada et al. (2019) also suggests that the mean annual occurrence 
of extremely hot days in Japan will be expected to increase by 1.8 times under a global warming level of 2°C 
above pre-industrial levels. Kawase et al. (2019) showed that the extreme rainfall in Japan during this event 
was increased by approximately 7% due to recent rapid warming around Japan. Hence, it is virtually certain 
that these 2018 concurrent events would not have occurred without human-induced global warming. 
Concurrent events of this type are also projected to happen more frequently under higher levels of global 
warming. On the other hand, there is currently low confidence in projected changes in the frequency or 
strength of the anomalous circulation patterns leading to concurrent extremes (e.g. Cross-Chapter Box 10.1).  </p>

<p>The case studies presented in this Box illustrate the current state of knowledge regarding the contribution of 
human-induced climate change to recent concurrent extremes in the global domain. Recent years have seen a 
more frequent occurrence of such events. The heat wave in Europe in the 2019 boreal summer and its 
coverage in the global domain is an additional example (Vautard et al., 2020a). However, there are still very 
few studies investigating which types of concurrent extreme events could occur under increasing global 
warming. It has been noted that such events could also be of particular risk for concurrent impacts in the 
world’s breadbaskets (Zampieri et al., 2017; Kornhuber et al., 2020). </p>

<p>In summary, the 2015-2016 extreme El Niño and the 2018 boreal spring/summer extremes were two 
examples of recent concurrent extremes. The El Niño event in 2015-2016 was one of the three extreme El 
Niño events since 1980s and there are many extreme events concurrently observed in this period including 
droughts, heavy precipitation, and more frequent intense tropical cyclones. Both the ENSO amplitude and 
the frequency of high-magnitude events since 1950 is higher than over the pre-industrial period (medium 
confidence), suggesting that global extremes similar to those associated with the 2015-2016 El Niño would 
occur more frequently under further increases in global warming. The 2018 boreal spring/summer extremes 
were characterized by heat extremes and enhanced droughts in wide areas of the mid-latitudes in the 
Northern Hemisphere and extremely heavy rainfall in East Asia. These concurrent events were generally 
related to abnormal condition of the jet and North Pacific Subtropical High, but also amplified by 
background global warming. It is virtually certain that these 2018 concurrent extreme events would not have 
occurred without human-induced global warming. Recent years have seen a more frequent occurrence of 
such concurrent events. However, it is still unknown which types of concurrent extreme events could occur 
under increasing global warming. </p>
