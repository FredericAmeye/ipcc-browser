<p>A consistent risk framework (Reisinger et al., 2020) has been adopted across the three Working Groups 
(WG) in IPCC AR6 while recognizing the diversity of risk concepts across disciplines. WGI is assessing 
changes in climatic impact-drivers (CIDs), which are physical climate system conditions (e.g., means, events 
and extremes) that affect an element of society or ecosystems. Depending on system tolerance, CIDs and 
their changes can be detrimental, beneficial, neutral, or a mixture of each across interacting system elements 
and regions (Sections 12.1-12.3). In the assessment of Representative Key Risk (RKR) categories and 
Reasons for Concerns (RFCs) in WGII Chapter 16, the focus lies on the adverse consequences of climate 
change, for which many types of CIDs (i.e., ‘hazards’ in the context of identified risks) play a key role. This 
box synthesizes the assessment of such hazards according to global warming levels (GWLs) from various 
chapters of WGI to inform understanding of their potential changes and associated risks with temperature 
levels in general, and in particular to facilitate WGII integrated assessments of RKRs and RFCs. Another 
cross-chapter box, CCB 11.1, connects the organization of regional information according to GWLs to the 
other common dimension along which future projections are organized, i.e., scenarios. Section 1.6 describes 
all dimensions of integration adopted in this report, adding cumulative carbon emissions to GWLs and 
scenarios. </p>

<p>Eight RKRs are identified within WGII Chapter 16: <br />
- RKR-A: risk to the integrity of low-lying coastal socio-ecological systems; <br />
- RKR-B: risk to terrestrial and ocean ecosystems; <br />
- RKR-C: risk to critical infrastructure and networks; <br />
- RKR-D: risk to living standards; <br />
- RKR-E: risk to human health; <br />
- RKR-F: risk to food security; <br />
- RKR-G: risk to water security; and 
- RKR-H: risk to peace and migration.  </p>

<p>RFCs further synthesize the landscape of risks from climatic changes into five categories (from IPCC TAR 
onward; Smith et al., 2001): <br />
- RFC1: Risks to unique and threatened systems; <br />
- RFC2: Risks associated with extreme weather events; <br />
- RFC3: Risks associated with the distribution of impacts; <br />
- RFC4: Risks associated with global aggregate impacts; and 
- RFC5: Risks associated with large-scale singular events. <br />
Importantly, the assessment of risk in WGII considers hazards as only one component of an integrated 
assessment that involves their complex interaction with exposure and vulnerability of the systems at risk 
(Reisinger et al., 2020).  </p>

<p>Hazards relevant to RKRs and RFCs are identified among aspects of the climate system that have an 
episodic, short term nature, like extreme events (particularly relevant to RFC2 but contributing to many other 
risk categories). Increasing GWLs translate into changing characteristics of frequency, duration, intensity, 
seasonality and spatial extent for many of these hazards also apparent in scenario-based results (Chapter 11, 
Chapter 12, Sections 12.4 and 12.5.1). Also, increasing GWLs increase the likelihood of compound temporal 
or spatial occurrence of similar or different hazards (Chapter 11, Section 11.8). Other relevant hazards 
coincide with long-term trends embodying a gradual change that may result in unfavorable environmental 
conditions. Furthermore, RFC5’s focus on singular events includes concern surrounding potential tipping 
points and irreversible behavior in the physical climate system.  </p>

<p>Cross-Chapter Box 12.2 Table 1 organizes information by hazard and presents current state and future change 
assessments with increasing GWLs (defined by increasing GSAT, see CCB2.3). We draw on individual 
chapters across the WG1 report for the assessment of how these hazards vary with GWL. Hazards for which 
a relation to GWLs has not been assessed are not reported in the table.  </p>
