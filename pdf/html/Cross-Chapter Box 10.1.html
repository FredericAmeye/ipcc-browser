<p>The Arctic has very likely warmed more than twice the global rate over the past 50 years with the greatest 
increase during the cold season (Atlas 11.2). Several mechanisms are responsible for the enhanced lower 
troposphere warming of the Arctic, including ice-albedo, lapse rate, Planck and cloud feedbacks (Section 
7.4.4.1). The rapid Arctic warming strongly affects the ocean, atmosphere, and cryosphere in that region 
(Atlas 11.2, Section 2.3.2.1). Averaged over the decade 2010-2019, monthly-average sea ice area in August, 
September and October has been about 25% smaller than that during 1979-1988 (high confidence, Section 
9.3.1.1). It is very likely that anthropogenic forcings mainly due to greenhouse gas increases have contributed 
substantially to Arctic sea ice loss since 1979, explaining at least half of the observed long-term decrease in 
summer sea-ice extent (Section 3.4.1.1).  </p>

<p>In this box, the possible influences of the Arctic warming on the lower latitudes is assesed. This linkage was 
also the topic of the Box 3.2 of the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate 
(SROCC; IPCC, 2019b). It is a topic that has been strongly debated (Ogawa et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018a). 
Separate hypotheses have emerged for winter and summer that describe possible mechanisms of how the 
Arctic can influence the weather and climate at lower latitudes. They involve changes in the polar vortex, 
storm tracks, jet stream, planetary waves, stratosphere-troposphere coupling, and eddy-mean flow 
interactions, thereby affecting the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation, and the frequency, intensity, 
duration, seasonality and spatial extent of extremes and climatic impact-drivers like cold spells, heat waves, 
and floods (Cross-Chapter Box 10.1, Figure 1). However, we note that a decrease in the intensity of cold 
extremes has been observed in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes in winter since 1950 (van Oldenborgh 
et al., 2019; Section 11.3.2). Since SROCC new literature has appeared, and the mechanisms and their 
criticisms are assessed here as an update and extension to the SROCC box.  </p>

<h3>Mechanisms for a potential influence in winter</h3>

<p>It has been proposed that Arctic amplification, by reducing the equator-pole temperature contrast, could 
result in a weaker and more meandering jet with Rossby waves of larger amplitude (Francis et al., 2017). 
This may cause weather systems to travel eastward more slowly and thus, all other things being equal, Arctic 
amplification could lead to more persistent weather patterns over the mid-latitudes (Francis and Vavrus, 
2012). The persistent large meandering flow may increase the likelihood of connected patterns of 
temperature and precipitation climatic impact-drivers because they frequently occur when atmospheric 
circulation patterns are persistent, which tends to occur with a strong meridional wind component. Another 
possible consequence of Arctic warming is on the NAO/AO that shows a negative trend over the past two 
decades (Robson et al., 2016; Iles and Hegerl, 2017), and has been linked to the reduction of sea ice in the 
Barents and Kara seas, and the increase in Eurasian snow cover (Cohen et al., 2012; Nakamura et al., 2015; 
Yang et al., 2016). During negative NAO/AO the storm tracks shift equatorward and winters are 
predominantly more severe across northern Eurasia and the eastern United States, but relatively mild in the 
Arctic. This temperature pattern is sometimes referred to as the “warm Arctic–cold continents (WACC)” 
pattern (Chen et al., 2018). However, Sun et al. (2016a) noticed that the WACC is a manifestation of natural 
variability. Enhanced sea-ice loss in the Barents-Kara Sea has also been related to a weakening of the 
stratospheric polar vortex (Kretschmer et al., 2020) and its increased variability (Kretschmer et al., 2016) 
that would induce a negative NAO/AO (Kim et al., 2014), the WACC pattern (Kim et al., 2014), and an 
increase in cold-air outbreaks in mid-latitudes (Kretschmer et al., 2018). Arctic warming might also increase 
Eurasian snow cover in autumn caused by the moister air that is advected into Eurasia from the Arctic with 
reduced sea-ice cover (Cohen et al., 2014; Jaiser et al., 2016), although Peings (2019) suggests a possible 
influence of Ural blockings on both the autumn snow cover and the early winter polar stratosphere. The 
circulation changes over the Ural-Siberian region are also suggested to provide a link between Barents-Kara 
sea ice and the NAO (Santolaria-Otín et al., 2021).  </p>

<h3>Mechanisms for a potential influence in summer</h3>

<p>As in winter, Arctic summer warming may result in a weakening of the westerly jet and mid-latitude storm 
tracks, as suggested for the recent period of Arctic warming (Coumou et al., 2015; Petrie et al., 2015; Chang 
et al., 2016). Additional proposed consequences are a southward shift of the jet (Butler et al., 2010) and a 
double jet structure associated with an increase of the land-ocean thermal gradient at the coastal boundary 
(Coumou et al., 2018). It is hypothesized that weaker jets, diminished meridional temperature contrast, and 
reduced baroclinicity might induce a larger amplitude in stationary wave response to stationary forcings 
(Zappa et al., 2011; Petoukhov et al., 2013; Hoskins and Woollings, 2015; Coumou et al., 2018; Mann et al., 
2018; Zhang et al., 2020b), and also that a double jet structure would favour wave resonance (Kornhuber et 
al., 2017; Mann et al., 2017). Some studies suggest that this is corroborated by an observed increase of quasi-
stationary waves (Di Capua and Coumou, 2016; Vavrus et al., 2017; Coumou et al., 2018). </p>

<h3>Assessment</h3>

<p>The above proposed hypotheses are based on concepts of geophysical fluid dynamics and surface coupling 
and can, in principle, help explain the existence of a link between the Arctic changes and the mid-latitudes 
with the potential to affect many impact sectors (Barnes and Screen, 2015). However, the validity of some 
dynamical underlying mechanisms, such as a reduced meridional temperature contrast inducing enhanced 
wave amplitude, has been questioned (Hassanzadeh et al., 2014; Hoskins and Woollings, 2015). On the 
contrary, the reduced meridional temperature contrast has been related to reduced meridional temperature 
advection and thereby reduced winter temperature variability (Collow et al., 2019).  </p>

<p>Studies that support the Arctic influence are mostly based on observational relationships between the Arctic 
temperature or sea-ice extent and mid-latitude anomalies or extremes (Cohen et al., 2012; Francis and 
Vavrus, 2012, 2015; Budikova et al., 2017). They are often criticised for the lack of statistical significance 
and the inability to disentangle cause and effect (Barnes, 2013; Barnes and Polvani, 2013; Screen and 
Simmonds, 2013; Barnes et al., 2014; Hassanzadeh et al., 2014; Barnes and Screen, 2015; Sorokina et al., 
2016; Douville et al., 2017; Gastineau et al., 2017; Blackport and Screen, 2020a; Oudar et al., 2020; Riboldi 
et al., 2020). The role of the Barents-Kara Sea ice loss is challenged by Blackport et al. (2019) who find a 
minimal influence of reduced sea ice on severe mid-latitude winters, and by Warner et al. (2019) who 
suggest that the apparent winter NAO response to the Barents-Kara sea-ice variability is mainly an artefact 
of the Aleutian Low internal variability and of the co-variability between sea ice and the Aleutian Low 
originating from tropical-extratropical teleconnections. Also Gong et al. (2020) do not find a link between 
Rossby wave propagation into the midlatitudes and Arctic sea ice loss. Mori et al. (2019a) argue that models 
underestimate the influence of the Barents-Kara Sea ice loss on the atmosphere, which is disputed by Screen 
and Blackport (2019). Other studies have stressed the importance of atmospheric variability as a driver of 
Arctic variability (Lee, 2014; Woods and Caballero, 2016; Praetorius et al., 2018; Olonscheck et al., 2019). 
Analysing observed key variables of mid-latitude climate for 1980-2020, Blackport and Screen (2020b) and 
Riboldi et al. (2020) argue that the Arctic influence on mid-latitudes is small compared to other aspects of 
climate variability, and that observed periods of strong correlation are an artefact of internal variability or 
intermittency (Kolstad and Screen, 2019; Siew et al., 2020; Warner et al., 2020). </p>

<p>An additional argument in the criticism is the inability of climate models to simulate a significant response to 
Arctic sea-ice loss, larger than the natural variability (Screen et al., 2014; Walsh, 2014; Chen et al., 2016a; 
Peings et al., 2017; Dai and Song, 2020), although some studies find a significant response in summer, 
because then the internal variability is weaker (Petrie et al., 2015). </p>

<p>Finally, a warmer Arctic climate can, without any additional changes in atmospheric dynamics, reduce cold 
extremes in winter due to advection of increasingly warmer air from the Arctic into the mid-latitudes 
(Screen, 2014; Ayarzagüena and Screen, 2016; Ayarzagüena et al., 2018). </p>

<p>Summarizing, different hypotheses have been developed about the influence of recent Arctic warming on the 
mid-latitudes in both winter and summer. Although some of the proposed mechanisms seem to be supported 
by various studies, such as the link with Barents-Kara Sea ice loss in winter and weakened storm tracks in 
summer, the underlying mechanisms and relative strength compared to internal climate variability have been 
questioned. A recent review (Cohen et al., 2020) states that divergent conclusions between model and 
observational studies, and also between different model studies, continue to obfuscate a clear understanding 
of how Arctic warming is influencing mid-latitude weather. In this context, Shepherd (2016) stresses the 
need for collaboration between scientists with different viewpoints for further understanding that could be 
achived by carefully designed, multi-investigator, coordinated, multi-model simulations, data analyses and 
diagnostics (Overland et al., 2016). In agreement with Box 3.2 of SROCC, there is hence low to medium 
confidence in the exact role and quantitative effect of historical Arctic warming and sea-ice loss on mid-
latitude atmospheric variability. </p>

<p>Regarding future climate, it is important to note that mid-latitude variability is also affected by many drivers 
other than the Arctic changes and that those drivers as well as the linkages to mid-latitude variability might 
change in a warmer world. The AMV, PDV, ENSO (see Annex IV), upper tropospheric tropical heating, 
polar stratospheric vortex, and land-surface processes associated with soil moisture (Miralles et al., 2014; 
Hauser et al., 2016) are a few examples. A considerable body of literature has shown that changes to the 
NAO/AO on seasonal and climate change time scales can be driven by variations in the wavelength and 
amplitude of Rossby waves, mainly of tropical origin (Fletcher and Kushner, 2011; Cattiaux and Cassou, 
2013; Ding et al., 2014; Goss et al., 2016). The influence of future Arctic warming on mid-latitude 
circulation is difficult to disentangle from the effect of such a plethora of drivers (Blackport and Kushner, 
2017; Li et al., 2018a). One of the consequences of climate change is a poleward shift of the jet induced by 
the tropical warming (Barnes and Polvani, 2013), which is less obvious in winter especially over the North 
Atlantic (Peings et al., 2018; Oudar et al., 2020), and the increase of the meridional temperature gradient in 
the upper troposphere, which increases storm track activity (Barnes and Screen, 2015). Although climate 
models indicate that future Arctic warming and the associated equator-pole temperature gradient could affect 
mid-latitude climate and variability (Haarsma et al., 2013b; McCusker et al., 2017; Zappa et al., 2018), and 
even the tropics and sub-tropics (Deser et al., 2015; Cvijanovic et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018; England et 
al., 2020; Kennel and Yulaeva, 2020), they do not reveal a strong influence on extreme weather (Woollings 
et al., 2014). </p>

<p>In conclusion, there is low confidence in the relative contribution of Arctic warming to mid-latitude 
atmospheric changes compared to other drivers. Future climate change could affect mid-latitude variability 
in a number of ways that are still to be clarified, and which may also include the influence of Arctic 
warming. The linkages between the Arctic warming and the mid-latitude circulation is an example of 
contrasting lines of evidence that cannot yet be reconciled (Section 10.5).  </p>
