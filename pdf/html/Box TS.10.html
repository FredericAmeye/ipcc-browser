<p>The attribution of observed changes in extremes to human influence (including greenhouse gas and aerosol 
emissions and land-use changes) has substantially advanced since AR5, in particular for extreme 
precipitation, droughts, tropical cyclones, and compound extremes (high confidence). There is limited 
evidence for windstorms and convective storms. Some recent hot extreme events would have been extremely 
unlikely to occur without human influence on the climate system. (TS.1) {Cross-Working Group Box: Attribution, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.6, 11.7, 11.8} </p>

<p>Since AR5, the attribution of extreme weather events has emerged as a growing field of climate research 
with an increasing body of literature. It provides evidence that greenhouse gases and other external forcings 
have affected individual extreme weather events by disentangling anthropogenic drivers from natural 
variability. Event attribution is now an important line of evidence for assessing changes in extremes on 
regional scales. {Cross-Working Group Box: Attribution, TS.1, 11.1.4} </p>

<p>The regional extremes and events that have been studied are geographically uneven. A few events, for 
example, extreme rainfall events in the UK, heat waves in Australia, or Hurricane Harvey that hit Texas in 
2017, have been heavily studied. Many highly impactful extreme weather events have not been studied in the 
event attribution framework, particularly in the developing world where studies are generally lacking. This is 
due to various reasons, including lack of observational data, lack of reliable climate models, and lack of 
scientific capacity. While the events that have been studied are not representative of all extreme events that 
have occurred, and results from these studies may also be subject to selection bias, the large number of event 
attribution studies provide evidence that changes in the properties of these local and individual events are in 
line with expected consequences of human influence on the climate and can be attributed to external drivers.

<p>It is very likely that human influence is the main contributor to the observed increase in the intensity and 
frequency of hot extremes and the observed decrease in the intensity and frequency of cold extremes on 
continental scales. Some specific recent hot extreme events would have been extremely unlikely to occur 
without human influence on the climate system. Changes in aerosol concentrations have likely slowed the 
increase in hot extremes in some regions in particular from 1950â€“1980. No-till farming, irrigation, and crop 
expansion have similarly attenuated increases in summer hot extremes in some regions, such as central North 
America (medium confidence). {11.3.4} </p>

<p>Human influence has contributed to the intensification of heavy precipitation in three continents where 
observational data are most abundant, including North America, Europe and Asia (high confidence). On 
regional scales, evidence of human influence on extreme precipitation is limited, but new evidence from 
attributing individual heavy precipitation events found that human influence was a significant driver of the 
events. {11.4.4} </p>

<p>There is low confidence that human influence has affected trends in meteorological droughts in most regions, 
but medium confidence that they have contributed to the severity of some specific events. There is medium 
confidence that human-induced climate change has contributed to increasing trends in the probability or 
intensity of recent agricultural and ecological droughts, leading to an increase of the affected land area. 
{11.6.4} </p>

<p>Event attribution studies of specific strong tropical cyclones provide limited evidence for anthropogenic 
effects on tropical cyclone intensifications so far, but high confidence for increases in precipitation. There is 
high confidence that anthropogenic climate change contributed to extreme rainfall amounts during Hurricane 
Harvey (2017) and other intense tropical cyclones. {11.7.3} </p>

<p>The number of evident attribution studies on compound events is limited. There is medium confidence that 
weather conditions that promote wildfires have become more probable in southern Europe, northern Eurasia, 
the USA, and Australia over the last century. In Australia a number of event attribution studies show that 
there is medium confidence of increase in fire weather conditions due to human influence. {11.8.3, 12.4.3.2} </p>
