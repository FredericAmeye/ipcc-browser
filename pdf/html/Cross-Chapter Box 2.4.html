<p>Throughout this Report, information about past climate states is presented in the context of specific climate 
variables, processes or regions. This Cross-Chapter Box focuses on a single paleoclimate reference period as 
an example of how proxy data, models and process understanding come together to form a more complete 
representation of a warm climate state that occurred during the relatively recent geologic past. </p>

<p><em>Introduction.</em> The Pliocene Epoch is one of the best-documented examples of a warmer world during which 
the slow responding components of the climate system were approximately in balance with concentrations of 
atmospheric CO2, similar to present (e.g., Haywood et al., 2016). It provides a means to constrain Earth’s 
equilibrium climate sensitivity (Section 7.5.3) and to assess climate model simulations (Section 7.4.4.1.2). 
During the Pliocene, continental configurations were similar to present (Cross-Chapter Box 2.4 Figure 1a), 
and many plant and animal species living then also exist today. These similarities increase reliability of 
paleo-environmental reconstructions compared with those for older geological periods. Within the well-
studied mid-Pliocene Warm Period (MPWP, also called the mid-Piacenzian Warm Period, 3.3–3.0 Ma), the 
interglacial period KM5c (3.212–3.187 Ma) has become a focus of research because its orbital configuration, 
and therefore insolation forcing, was similar to present (global mean insolation = –0.022 W⋅m<sup>-2</sup> relative to 
modern; Haywood et al., 2013), allowing for the climatic state associated with relatively high atmospheric 
CO2 to be assessed with fewer confounding variables. </p>

<p><em>Major global climate indicators.</em> During the KM5c interglacial, atmospheric CO2 concentration was 
typically between 360 and 420 ppm (Section 2.2.3.1). New climate simulations of this interval from the 
Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project Phase 2 (PlioMIP2) show a multi-model mean global surface air 
temperature of 3.2°C [2.1–4.8] °C warmer than control simulations (Haywood et al., 2020; Cross-Chapter 
Box 2.4 Figure 1a). This is consistent with proxy evidence for the broader MPWP, which indicates that 
global mean surface temperature was 2.5°C–4.0°C higher than 1850–1900 (Section 2.3.1.1.1). Global mean 
sea level was between 5 and 25 m higher than present (Section 2.3.3.3). Geological evidence (Section 
2.3.2.4) and ice-sheet modelling (Section 9.6.2) indicate that both the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets 
were substantially smaller than present (Cross-Chapter Box 2.4 Figure 1c). Attribution of sea level 
highstands to particular ice sheet sources (Section 9.6.2) is challenging (DeConto &amp; Pollard, 2016; Golledge, 
2020), but improving (Berends et al., 2019; Grant et al., 2019).  </p>

<p><em>Northern high latitudes.</em> The latitudinal temperature gradient during the MPWP was reduced relative to 
present-day and the consistency between proxy and modelled temperatures has improved since AR5 (Section 
7.4.4.1.2). Northern high latitude (> 60°N) SSTs were up to 7°C higher than 1850–1900 (Bachem et al., 
2016; McClymont et al., 2020; Sánchez-Montes et al., 2020), and terrestrial biomes were displaced poleward 
(e.g., Dowsett et al., 2019) (Cross-Chapter Box 2.4, Figure 1b). Arctic tundra regions currently underlain by 
permafrost were warm enough to support boreal forests, which shifted northward by approximately 250 km 
in Siberia, and up to 2000 km in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (Fletcher et al., 2017; Salzmann et al., 
2013). The shift caused high-latitude surface albedo changes, which further amplified the Pliocene global 
warming (Zhang &amp; Jiang, 2014). Vegetation changes in northeast Siberia indicate that MPWP summer 
temperatures were up to 6°C higher than present day (Brigham-Grette et al., 2013). Farther south, modern 
boreal forest regions in Russia and eastern North America were covered with temperate forests and 
grasslands, whereas highly diverse, warm-temperate forests with subtropical taxa were widespread in central and eastern Europe (Cross-Chapter Box 2.4, Figure 1). While seasonal sea ice was present in the North 
Atlantic and Arctic oceans, its winter extent was reduced relative to present (Knies et al., 2014; Clotten et al., 
2018), and some models suggest that the Arctic was sea ice free during the summer (Feng et al., 2020; 
Howell et al., 2016).  </p>

<p><em>Tropical Pacific.</em> The average longitudinal temperature gradient in the tropical Pacific was weaker during 
the Pliocene than during 1850–1900 (Section 7.4.4.2.2). Changes in Pacific SSTs and SST gradients had far-
reaching impacts on regional climates through atmospheric teleconnections, affecting rainfall patterns in 
western North America (Burls &amp; Fedorov, 2017; Ibarra et al., 2018). The reduced zonal SST gradient has led 
some to propose that the Pliocene Pacific experienced a “permanent El Niño” state (Molnar and Cane, 2002; 
Fedorov, 2006). However, there is no direct geological evidence, nor support from climate models, that 
ENSO variability collapsed during the Pliocene. Although not located in the centre-of-action region for 
ENSO, Pliocene corals show temperature variability over 3–7 year timescales (Watanabe et al., 2011). In 
addition, a multi-model intercomparison indicates that ENSO existed, albeit with reduced variability 
(Brierley, 2015). Thus, there is high confidence that ENSO variability existed during the Pliocene. </p>

<p><em>Hydrological cycle.</em> Vegetation reconstructions for the late Pliocene indicate regionally wetter conditions 
resulting in an expansion of tropical savannas and woodlands in Africa and Australia at the expense of 
deserts (Cross-Chapter Box 2.4, Figure 1b). PlioMIP2 climate models generally simulate higher rates of 
mean annual precipitation in the tropics and high latitudes, and a decrease in the subtropics, with a multi-
model mean global increase of 0.19 mm day-1 [0.13–0.32 mm day-1] relative to control simulations 
(Haywood et al., 2020) (Cross-Chapter Box 2.4, Figure 1a). Both simulations and limited proxy evidence 
indicate stronger monsoons in northern Africa, Asia, and northern Australia relative to present, but trends are 
uncertain in other monsoon regions (Huang X. et al., 2019; Li X. et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 
2019). There is thus medium confidence that monsoon systems were stronger during the Pliocene. 
Simulations of MPWP climate show that global tropical cyclone intensity and duration increased during the 
MPWP (Yan et al., 2016); however, there is low confidence in this result because inter-model variability is 
high. </p>

<p><em>Summary</em>. During the MPWP (3.3–3.0 Ma) the atmospheric CO2 concentration was similar to present, and 
the slow-response, large-scale indicators reflect a world that was warmer than present. With very high 
confidence, relative to present, global surface temperature, sea level, and precipitation rate were higher, NH 
latitudinal temperature gradient was lower, and major terrestrial biomes expanded poleward. With medium 
confidence from proxy-based evidence alone (Section 2.3.2), combined with numerical modelling, analysis 
of the sea-level budget, and process understanding (Section 9.6.2), there is high confidence that cryospheric 
indicators were diminished. There is medium confidence that the Pacific longitudinal temperature gradient 
was weaker and monsoon systems were stronger. </p>
