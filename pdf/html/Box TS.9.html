<p>The present rate of response of many aspects of the climate system are proportionate to the rate of recent 
temperature change, but some aspects may respond disproportionately. Some climate system components are 
slow to respond, such as the deep ocean overturning circulation and the ice sheets. It is virtually certain that 
irreversible, committed change is already underway for the slow-to-respond processes as they come into 
adjustment for past and present emissions. The paleoclimate record indicates that tipping elements exist in 
the climate system where processes undergo sudden shifts toward a different sensitivity to forcing, such as 
during a major deglaciation, where one degree of temperature change might correspond to a large or small 
ice sheet mass loss during different stages. For global climate indicators, evidence for abrupt change is 
limited, but deep ocean warming, acidification and sea level rise are committed to ongoing change for 
millennia after global surface temperatures initially stabilize and are irreversible on human time scales (very 
high confidence). At the regional scale, abrupt responses, tipping points and even reversals in the direction of 
change cannot be excluded (high confidence). Some regional abrupt changes and tipping points could have 
severe local impacts, such as unprecedented weather, extreme temperatures and increased frequency of 
droughts and forest fires. Models that exhibit such tipping points are characterised by abrupt changes once 
the threshold is crossed, and even a return to pre-threshold surface temperatures or to atmospheric carbon 
dioxide concentrations, does not guarantee that the tipping elements return to their pre-threshold state. 
Monitoring and early warning systems are being put into place to observe tipping elements in the climate 
system. {Box TS.2, Box TS.4, TS 3.3.2, 1.3, 1.4.4, 1.5, 4.3.2, Table 4.10, 5.3.4, 5.4.9, 7.5.3, 9.2.2, 9.2.4, 
9.4.1, 9.4.2, 9.6.3, Cross-chapter Box 12.1} </p>

<p>Understanding of multi-decadal reversibility (i.e., the system returns to the previous climate state within 
multiple decades after the radiative forcing is removed) has improved since AR5 for many atmospheric, land 
surface and sea ice climate metrics following sea surface temperature recovery. Some processes suspected of 
having tipping points, such as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), have been found to 
often undergo recovery after temperature stabilization with a time delay (low confidence). However, 
substantial irreversibility is further substantiated for some cryosphere changes, ocean warming, sea level rise, 
and ocean acidification. {4.7.2, 5.3.3, 5.4.9, 9.2.2, 9.2.4, 9.4.1, 9.4.2, 9.6.3}  </p>

<p>Some climate system components are slow to respond, such as the deep ocean overturning circulation and 
the ice sheets. It is likely that under stabilization of global warming at 1.5°C, 2.0°C, or 3.0°C relative to 
1850–1900, the AMOC will continue to weaken for several decades by about 15%, 20% and 30% of its 
strength and then recover to pre-decline values over several centuries (medium confidence). At sustained 
warming levels between 2°C and 3°C, there is limited evidence that the Greenland and West Antarctic Ice 
Sheets will be lost almost completely and irreversibly over multiple millennia; both the probability of their 
complete loss and the rate of mass loss increases with higher surface temperatures (high confidence). At 
sustained warming levels between 3°C and 5°C, near-complete loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet and complete 
loss of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is projected to occur irreversibly over multiple millennia (medium 
confidence); with substantial parts or all of Wilkes Subglacial Basin in East Antarctica lost over multiple 
millennia (low confidence). Early-warning signals of accelerated sea-level-rise from Antarctica, could 
possibly be observed within the next few decades. For other hazards (e.g., ice sheet behaviour, glacier mass 
loss and global mean sea level change, coastal floods, coastal erosion, air pollution, and ocean acidification) 
the time and/or scenario dimensions remain critical, and a simple and robust relationship with global 
warming level cannot be established (high confidence). {4.3.2, 4.7.2, 5.4.3, 5.4.5, 5.4.8, 8.6, 9.2, 9.4, 
Box 9.3, Cross-Chapter Box 12.1} </p>

<p>For global climate indicators, evidence for abrupt change is limited. For global warming up to 2°C above 
1850-1900 levels, paleoclimate records do not indicate abrupt changes in the carbon cycle (low confidence). 
Despite the wide range of model responses, uncertainty in atmospheric CO2 by 2100 is dominated by future 
anthropogenic emissions rather than uncertainties related to carbon-climate feedbacks (high confidence). 
There is no evidence of abrupt change in climate projections of global temperature for the next century: there 
is a near-linear relationship between cumulative CO2 emissions and maximum global mean surface air 
temperature increase caused by CO2 over the course of this century for global warming levels up to at least 
2°C relative to 1850-1900. The increase in global ocean heat content (TS2.4) will likely continue until at 
least 2300 even for low-emission scenarios, and global mean sea level rise will continue to rise for centuries 
to millennia following cessation of emissions (Box TS.4) due to continuing deep ocean heat uptake and mass 
loss of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets (high confidence). {2.2.3; Cross-Chapter Box 2.1; 5.1.1; 5.4; 
Cross-Chapter Box 5.1; Figures 5.3, 5.4, 5.25, 5.26; 9.2.2; 9.2.4} </p>

<p>The response of biogeochemical cycles to anthropogenic perturbations can be abrupt at regional scales and 
irreversible on decadal to century time scales (high confidence). The probability of crossing uncertain 
regional thresholds increases with climate change (high confidence). It is very unlikely that gas clathrates 
(mostly methane) in deeper terrestrial permafrost and subsea clathrates will lead to a detectable departure 
from the emissions trajectory during this century. Possible abrupt changes and tipping points in 
biogeochemical cycles lead to additional uncertainty in 21st century atmospheric GHG concentrations, but 
future anthropogenic emissions remain the dominant uncertainty (high confidence). There is potential for 
abrupt water cycle changes in some high-emission scenarios, but there is no overall consistency regarding 
the magnitude and timing of such changes. Positive land surface feedbacks, including vegetation, dust, and 
snow, can contribute to abrupt changes in aridity, but there is only low confidence that such changes will 
occur during the 21st century. Continued Amazon deforestation, combined with a warming climate, raises 
the probability that this ecosystem will cross a tipping point into a dry state during the 21st century (low 
confidence). {TS3.2.2, 5.4.3, 5.4.5, 5.4.8, 5.4.9, 8.6.2, 8.6.3, Cross-chapter Box 12.1} </p>
