<p>Changes in weather and climate extremes are determined by local exchanges in heat, moisture, and other 
related quantities (thermodynamic changes) and those associated with atmospheric and oceanic motions 
(dynamic changes). While thermodynamic and dynamic processes are interconnected, considering them 
separately helps to disentangle the roles of different processes contributing to changes in climate extremes 
(e.g. Shepherd, 2014).  </p>

<h3>Temperature extremes</h3>

<p>An increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leads to the warming of tropospheric 
air and the Earth’s surface. This direct thermodynamic effect leads to warmer temperatures everywhere with 
an increase in the frequency and intensity of warm extremes and a decrease in the frequency and intensity of 
cold extremes. The initial increase in temperature in turn leads to other thermodynamic responses and 
feedbacks affecting both the atmosphere and the surface. These include an increase in the water vapour 
content of the atmosphere (water vapour feedback, see Section 7.4.2.2) and a change in the vertical profile of 
temperature (e.g., lapse rate feedback, see Section 7.4.2.2). While the water vapour feedback always 
amplifies the initial temperature increases (positive feedback), the lapse rate feedback amplifies near-surface 
temperature increases (positive feedback) in mid- and high latitudes but reduces temperature increases 
(negative feedback) in tropical regions (Pithan and Mauritsen, 2014).  </p>

<p>Thermodynamic responses and feedbacks also occur through surface processes. For instance, observations 
and model simulations show that temperature increases, including extreme temperatures, are amplified in 
areas where seasonal snow cover is reduced due to decreases in surface albedo (see Section 11.3.1). In some 
mid-latitude areas, temperature increases are amplified by the higher atmospheric evaporative demand  (Fu 
and Feng, 2014; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2020b) that results in a drying of soils in some regions (Section 
11.6), leading to increased sensible heat fluxes (soil-moisture temperature feedback, see Sections 11.1.6 and 
11.3.1). Other thermodynamic feedback processes include changes in the water-use efficiency of plants 
under enhanced atmospheric CO2 concentrations that can reduce the overall transpiration, and thus also 
enhance temperature in projections (Sections 8.2.3.3, 11.1.6, 11.3, and 11.6). </p>

<p>Changes in the spatial distribution of temperatures can also affect temperature extremes by modifying the 
characteristics of weather patterns (e.g., Suarez-Gutierrez et al., 2020). For example, a robust thermodynamic 
effect of polar amplification is a weakened north-south temperature gradient, which amplifies the warming 
of cold extremes in the Northern Hemisphere mid- and high latitudes because of the reduction of cold air 
advection (Holmes et al., 2015; Schneider et al., 2015; Gross et al., 2020). Much less robust is the dynamic 
effect of polar amplification (Section 7.4.4.1) and the reduced low-altitude meridional temperature gradient 
that has been linked to an increase in the persistence of weather patterns (e.g., heatwaves) and subsequent 
increases in temperature extremes (Francis and Vavrus, 2012; Coumou et al., 2015, 2018; Mann et al., 2017) 
(CC-Box 10.1).  </p>

<h3>Precipitation extremes</h3>

<p>Changes in temperature also control changes in water vapour through increases in evaporation and in the 
water-holding capacity of the atmosphere (Section 8.2.1). At the global scale, column-integrated water 
vapour content increases roughly following the Clausius-Clapeyron (C-C) relation, with an increase of 
approximately 7% for every degree celsius of global-mean surface warming (Section 8.2.1). Nonetheless, at 
regional scales, water vapour increases differ from this C-C rate due to several reasons (Section 8.2.2), 
including a change in weather regimes and limitations in moisture transport from the ocean, which warms 
more slowly than land (Byrne and O’Gorman, 2018). Observational studies (Fischer and Knutti, 2016; Sun et 
al., 2020) have shown the observed rate of increase of precipitation extremes is similar to the C-C scaling at 
the global scale. Climate model projections show that the increase in water vapour leads to robust increases 
in precipitation extremes everywhere, with a magnitude that varies between 4% and 8% per degree celsius of 
surface warming (thermodynamic contribution, Box 11.1, Figure 1b). At regional scales, climate models 
show that the dynamic contribution (Box 11.1, Figure 1c) can be substantial and strongly modify the 
projected rate of change of extreme precipitation (Box 11.1, Figure 1a) with large regions in the subtropics 
showing robust reductions and other areas (e.g., equatorial Pacific) showing robust amplifications (Box 11.1, 
Figure 1c). However, the dynamic contributions show large differences across models and are more 
uncertain than thermodynamic contributions (Shepherd, 2014; Trenberth et al., 2015; Pfahl et al., 2017; Box 
11.1, Figure 1c).  </p>

<p>Dynamic contributions can occur in response to changes in the vertical and horizontal distribution of 
temperature (thermodynamics) and can affect the frequency and intensity of synoptic and subsynoptic 
phenomena including tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones, fronts, mesoscale-convective systems and 
thunderstorms. For example, the poleward shift and strengthening of the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude 
storm tracks (Section 4.5.1) can modify the frequency/intensity of extreme precipitation. However, the 
precise way in which dynamic changes will affect precipitation extremes is unclear due to several competing 
effects (Shaw et al., 2016; Allan et al., 2020). </p>

<p>Extreme precipitation can also be enhanced by dynamic responses and feedbacks occurring within storms 
that result from the extra latent heat released from the thermodynamic increases in moisture (Lackmann, 
2013; Willison et al., 2013; Marciano et al., 2015; Nie et al., 2018; Mizuta and Endo, 2020). The extra latent 
heat released within storms has been shown to increase precipitation extremes by strengthening convective 
updrafts and the intensity of the cyclonic circulation (e.g., Molnar et al., 2015; Nie et al., 2018), although 
weakening effects have also been found in mid-latitude cyclones (e.g., Kirshbaum et al., 2017). Additionally, 
the increase in latent heat can also suppress convection at larger scales due to atmospheric stabilization (Nie 
et al., 2018; Tandon et al., 2018; Kendon et al., 2019). As these dynamic effects result from feedback 
processes within storms where convective processes are crucial, their proper representation might require 
improving the horizontal/vertical resolution, the formulation of parameterizations, or both, in current climate 
models (i.e., Ban et al., 2015; Kendon et al., 2014; Meredith et al., 2015; Nie et al., 2018; Prein et al., 2015; 
Westra et al., 2014). </p>

<h3>Droughts</h3>

<p>Droughts are also affected by both thermodynamic and dynamic processes (Sections 8.2.3.3 and 11.6). 
Thermodynamic processes affect droughts by increasing atmospheric evaporative demand (Martin, 2018; 
Gebremeskel Haile et al., 2020; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2020b) through changes in air temperature, radiation, 
wind speed, and relative humidity. Dynamic processes affect droughts through changes in the occurrence, 
duration and intensity of weather anomalies, which are related to precipitation and the amount of sunlight 
(Section 11.6). While atmospheric evaporative demand increases with warming, regional changes in aridity 
are affected by increasing land-ocean warming contrast, vegetation feedbacks and responses to rising CO2 
concentrations and dynamic shifts in the location of the wet and dry parts of the atmospheric circulation in 
response to climate change as well as internal variability (Byrne and O’Gorman, 2015; Kumar et al., 2015; Allan et al., 2020). </p>

<p>In summary, both thermodynamic and dynamic processes are involved in the changes of extremes in 
response to warming. Anthropogenic forcing (e.g., increases in greenhouse gas concentrations) directly 
affects thermodynamic variables, including overall increases in high temperatures and atmospheric 
evaporative demand, and regional changes in atmospheric moisture, which intensify heatwaves, droughts and 
heavy precipitation events when they occur (high confidence). Dynamic processes are often indirect 
responses to thermodynamic changes, are strongly affected by internal climate variability and are also less 
well understood. As such, there is low confidence in how dynamic changes affect the location and magnitude 
of extreme events in a warming climate. </p>
