<p>Before the industrial period, explosive volcanic eruptions were the largest source of forced climate 
variability globally on interannual to centennial timescales (Section 2.2). While usually omitted from 
scenarios used for future climate projections, as they are unpredictable, volcanic eruptions have the potential 
to influence future climate on multi-annual to decadal timescales and affect many climatic impact drivers (as 
defined in Sections 12.1, 12.3). Since AR5, more comprehensive paleo evidence and observations, as well as 
improved modelling have advanced understanding of the climate response to past volcanic eruptions. 
Building on multiple chapter assessments, this box synthesizes how volcanic eruptions affect climate and 
considers implications of possible future events. </p>

<h3>How frequent are volcanic eruptions?</h3>

<p>Proxy records show that large volcanic eruptions with effective radiative forcing (ERF) more negative than –
1 W m-2 occurred on average twice a century throughout the last 2500 years, the most recent being Pinatubo 
in 1991 (Section 2.2.2). About eight larger eruptions (ERF stronger than –5 Wm-2) also occurred during this 
period (Figure 2.2), notably Tambora~1815 and Samalas~1257. A Samalas-type eruption may occur 1–2 
times per millennium on average (Newhall et al., 2018). Typically, three in every four centuries have 
experienced at least one eruption stronger than –1 W m-2 (Pinatubo or larger). The volcanic aerosol burden 
was 14% lower during the 20th century compared to the average of the preceding 24 centuries (Section 
2.2.2), whereas the 13th century was among the most volcanically active, with four eruptions exceeding that 
of Pinatubo-1991 (Sigl et al., 2015). </p>

<h3>Past climate responses to volcanic activity</h3>

<p>Major eruptions drive a range of climate system responses for several years depending upon whether the 
eruption occurs in the tropics (stratospheric aerosol dispersion into both hemispheres) or the extra-tropics 
(dispersion into the hemisphere of eruption) owing to the Brewer-Dobson circulation. The climatic response 
also depends on the effective injection height, sulphur mass injected, and time of year of the eruption 
(Marshall et al., 2019, 2020). These factors determine the total mass, lifetime and optical properties of 
volcanic aerosol in the stratosphere and influence the stratospheric aerosol optical depth (sAOD). The ERF 
from volcanic stratospheric aerosol is assessed to be –20 ± 5 W m–2 per unit sAOD (Section 7.3.4.6).  </p>

<p>Due to the direct radiative effect of volcanic stratospheric aerosols, large volcanic eruptions lead to an 
overall <em>decrease of GSAT</em>, which can extend to multi-decadal or century timescales in the case of clustered 
volcanism (Section 3.3.1.1, Schurer et al., 2013; McGregor et al., 2015; Sigl et al., 2015; Kobashi et al., 
2017; Zambri et al., 2017; Brönnimann et al., 2019; Neukom et al., 2019). Large eruptions also increase the 
frequency of extremely cold individual years and the likelihood of cooling trends occurring in individual 
decades (Cross-chapter Box 3.1, Section 4.4.4, Paik and Min, 2018). Re-dating of ice core chronologies now 
confirms that the coldest decades of the past ~2000 years are the outcome of volcanic eruptions (Sigl et al., 
2015; Büntgen et al., 2016b; Toohey et al., 2016b; Neukom et al., 2019). CMIP5 and CMIP6 models 
reproduce the decreased GSAT that follows periods of intense volcanism. New reconciliations between 
simulations and proxy-based reconstructions of past eruptions have been achieved through better Earth 
System Model representation of volcanic plume chemical compositions (Legrande et al., 2016; Marshall et 
al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020a). Yet, remaining disagreements reflect differences in the volcanic forcing datasets 
used in the simulations (medium confidence) (Section 3.3.1.1, Figure 3.2c). </p>

<p>Although incomplete, proxy records show large impacts upon contemporary society from eruptions such as 
1257 Samalas and 1815 Tambora, the latter resulting in ‘the year without a summer’ with multiple harvest 
failures across the NH (e.g., Raible et al., 2016). Comparing CMIP5 multi-model simulations with 
observations has improved understanding of the hydrological responses to 20th-century eruptions, 
particularly global land monsoon drying, and associated uncertainties (Section 3.3.2.2). Global-mean land 
<em>precipitation</em> decreases for up to a few years following the eruption, with climatologically wet regions 
drying and dry regions wetting (Section 3.3.2.2, Section 4.4.4). Changes in <em>monsoon</em> circulations occur with 
a general weakening of tropical precipitation (Section 8.5.2.3) and a decrease in extreme precipitation over 
global monsoon regions (Section 11.4.4). Monsoon precipitation in one hemisphere tends to be enhanced by 
eruptions occurring in the other hemisphere or reduced if they occur in the same hemisphere (Section 
3.3.2.2; 8.5.2.3). Volcanic eruptions have been linked to the onset of <em>El Niño</em> followed by <em>La Niña</em> although 
this connection remains contentious (Adams et al., 2003; Bradley et al., 2003; McGregor et al., 2010b; 
Khodri et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018a; Sun et al., 2019; Paik et al., 2020; Predybaylo et al., 2020). Volcanic 
activity could drive short-term (1-3 year) positive changes in the <em>annual SAM</em> index through modulations in 
the extratropical temperature gradient and wave driving of the polar stratosphere (Yang and Xiao, 2018). In 
the <em>cryosphere</em>, Arctic sea-ice extent increases for years to decades (Gagné et al., 2017b), and modelling 
indicates that sea-ice/ocean feedbacks can prolong cooling long after volcanic aerosols are removed (Miller 
et al., 2012). On annual timescales, the <em>ocean</em> buffers the atmospheric response to volcanic eruptions by 
storing the cooling in the ocean subsurface, then feeding it back to the atmosphere. Large eruptions affect 
ocean heat content and thermosteric sea level over decadal-to-centennial scales (Section 9.2.2.1). </p>

<h3>Potential implications on 21st century projections</h3>

<p>Given the unpredictability of individual eruptions, volcanic forcing is prescribed as a constant background 
loading in CMIP6 models (Eyring et al., 2016). This means the effects of potential large volcanic eruptions 
are largely absent from model projections, and few studies have addressed the potential implications on 21st 
century warming. One study considered future scenarios with hypothetical volcanic eruptions consistent with 
levels of CE volcanic activity (Bethke et al., 2017) under RCP4.5 and found that climate projections could be 
substantially altered (Cross Chapter Box 4.1 Figure 1). Although temporary, close to pre-industrial level 
temperatures could be experienced globally for a few years after a 1257 Samalas-sized eruption. Several 
other key climate indicators are also changed substantially, consistent with evidence from past events. 
(Bethke et al., 2017) suggest that an eruption early in the 21st century could delay the timing of crossing 
1.5°C global warming by several years. Clustered eruptions would have substantial impact upon GSAT 
evolution throughout the century (Cross-Chapter Box 4.1 Figure 1), and could have far-reaching 
implications, as observed for past eruptions. For near-term response options, decadal prediction models can 
update 21st-century projections once a volcanic eruption occurs (Timmreck et al., 2016). </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>It is likely that at least one large eruption will occur during the 21st century. Such an eruption would reduce 
GSAT for several years, decrease global-mean land precipitation, alter monsoon circulation, modify extreme 
precipitation, and change the profile of many regional climatic impact-drivers. A low likelihood high impact 
outcome would be several large eruptions that would greatly alter the 21st century climate trajectory 
compared to SSP-based ESM projections. </p>
