<p>Urban areas have special interactions with the climate system that produce heat islands. This box presents 
information about these processes, how they are parameterized in climate modules, and on the role of urban 
monitoring networks. A discussion on the observed climate trends and climate change projections for urban 
areas follows. </p>

<h3>Urban Heat Island</h3>

<p>During night-time, urban centres are often several degrees warmer than the surrounding rural area, a 
phenomenon known as the night-time canopy urban heat island effect (Bader et al., 2018; Kuang, 2019; Li et 
al., 2019, 2020d). While green and blue infrastructures can mitigate the urban heat island effect, three main 
factors contribute to its development (Hamdi et al., 2020; Masson et al., 2020): 1) three-dimensional urban 
geometry including building density and plan area, street aspect ratio and building height, 2) thermal 
characteristics of impervious surfaces, and 3) anthropogenic heat release, either from building energy 
consumption, especially waste heat from air conditioning systems, or as direct emissions from industry, 
traffic, or human metabolism (Ichinose et al., 1999; Sailor, 2011; de Munck et al., 2013; Bohnenstengel et 
al., 2014; Chow et al., 2014; Salamanca et al., 2014; Dou and Miao, 2017; Ma et al., 2017a; Chrysoulakis et 
al., 2018; Takane et al., 2019). Urban heat island magnitude is also affected by aerosols due to air pollution 
in urban areas (Cheng et al., 2020; Han et al., 2020) and by local background climate (Zhao et al., 2014; 
Ward et al., 2016). </p>

<h3>Monitoring Network</h3>

<p>Long-term climate datasets (a year or more) at the small spatial scales required to resolve processes of 
interest for cities (&lt;1 km) are scarce (Bader et al., 2018; Caluwaerts et al., 2020). Moreover, urban 
observation sites often represent only parts of the urban environment and are suboptimal for detecting urban 
effects (e.g., sites in city parks). Recently, city-scale climate monitoring networks as well as satellite and 
ground-based remote sensing are being used (though still missing in global south cities; Technical Annex I), 
enhancing our understanding of the urban microclimate and its interaction with climate change, and 
providing key information for users (Chen et al., 2012a; Barlow et al., 2017; Bader et al., 2018). It has been 
found that harmonization of collection practices, instrumentation, station locations, and quality control 
methodologies across urban environments needs improvement to facilitate collaborative research (Muller et 
al., 2013; Barlow et al., 2017). Real time crowdsourcing data is becoming available (Section 10.2.4). The 
urban climate community is making efforts to understand how these methods can complement traditional 
datasets (Meier et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2018; Langendijk et al., 2019a; Venter et al., 2020). </p>

<h3>Urban Modules in Climate Models</h3>

<p>Exchanges of heat, water and momentum between the urban surface and its overlying atmosphere are 
calculated using specific surface-atmosphere exchange schemes. Three different schemes, here in order of 
increasing complexity, can be distinguished (Masson, 2006; Grimmond et al., 2010, 2011; Chen et al., 2011; 
Best and Grimmond, 2015): 1) In the slab or bulk approach, the three-dimensional city structure is not 
resolved but cities are represented by modifying soil and vegetation parameters within land surface models, 
increasing roughness length and displacement height (e.g., Best et al., 2006; Dandou et al., 2005; Liu et al., 
2006; Seaman et al., 1989). The energy balance is often modified to account for the radiation trapped by the 
urban canopy, heat storage, evaporation and anthropogenic heat fluxes. 2) Single-layer urban canopy 
modules use a simplified geometry (urban canyon, with three surface types: roof, road and wall) that 
approximately capture the three-dimensional dynamical and thermal physical processes influencing radiative 
and energy fluxes (Masson, 2000; Kusaka et al., 2001). 3) Multi-layer urban canopy modules compute urban 
effects vertically, allowing a direct interaction with the planetary boundary layer (Brown, 2000; Martilli et 
al., 2002; Hagishima et al., 2005; Dupont and Mestayer, 2006; Hamdi and Masson, 2008; Schubert et al., 
2012). Building-energy models that estimate anthropogenic heat from a building for given atmospheric 
conditions can be incorporated. Recent model development has focused on improving the representation of 
urban vegetation (Lee et al., 2016; Redon et al., 2017; Mussetti et al., 2020). </p>

<p>Global (McCarthy et al., 2010; Oleson et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2016b; Katzfey et al., 
2020; Sharma et al., 2020; Hertwig et al., 2021) and regional modelling groups (Kusaka et al., 2012b; 
McCarthy et al., 2012; Hamdi et al., 2014; Trusilova et al., 2016; Daniel et al., 2019; Halenka et al., 2019; 
Langendijk et al., 2019b) are beginning to implement these urban parameterizations within the land-surface 
component of their models. There is very high confidence (robust evidence and high agreement) that while 
all types of urban parameterizations generally simulate radiation exchanges in a realistic way, they have 
strong biases when simulating latent heat fluxes, though recent research incorporating in-canyon vegetation 
processes improved their performance. There is medium confidence (medium evidence, high agreement) 
(Kusaka et al., 2012a; McCarthy et al., 2012; Hamdi et al., 2014; Trusilova et al., 2016; Jänicke et al., 2017; 
Daniel et al., 2019) that a simple single-layer parameterization, is sufficient for the correct simulation of the 
urban heat island magnitude and its interplay with regional climate change. </p>

<h3>Observed Trends</h3>

<p>There is medium evidence but high agreement (Parker, 2010; Zhang et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2016b) that the 
global annual mean surface air temperature response to urbanization is negligible. There is very high 
confidence that the different observed warming trend in cities as compared to their surroundings can partly 
be attributed to urbanization (Box 10.3, Figure 1; Park et al., 2017). </p>

<p><figref>Box 10.3,Figure1</figref></p>

<p>There is very high confidence (robust evidence and high agreement) that the annual-mean minimum 
temperature is more affected by urbanization than the maximum temperature (Ezber et al., 2007; Fujibe, 
2009; Hamdi, 2010; Elagib, 2011; Camilloni and Barrucand, 2012; Robaa, 2013; Hausfather et al., 2013; 
Argüeso et al., 2014; Alghamdi and Moore, 2015; Alizadeh-Choobari et al., 2016; Sachindra et al., 2016; 
Liao et al., 2017; Lokoshchenko, 2017; Wang et al., 2017a; Arsiso et al., 2018). Beside temperature, 
urbanization can induce an urban dryness island, which refers to lower relative humidity in cities than in 
nearby rural locations (Lokoshchenko, 2017; Bian et al., 2020) and the urban wind island, where slower 
wind speeds are observed in cities (Wu et al., 2017; Bader et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2018). There is medium 
confidence (medium evidence and medium agreement) (Schlünzen et al., 2010; Ganeshan et al., 2013; 
Ganeshan and Murtugudde, 2015; Haberlie et al., 2015; Daniels et al., 2016; Liang and Ding, 2017; McLeod 
et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020c) that cities induce increases in mean and extreme precipitation over and 
downwind of the city especially in the afternoon and early evening. </p>

<h3>Climate Projections</h3>

<p>Estimates of the urban heat island under further climate change are very uncertain because studies using 
different methods report contrasting results. However, there is very high confidence (robust evidence and 
high agreement) that the projected change of the urban heat island under climate change conditions is one 
order of magnitude less than the projected warming in both urban and rural areas under simulation 
constraints of no urban growth (Adachi et al., 2012; Arsiso et al., 2018; Früh et al., 2011; Hamdi et al., 2014; 
Hatchett et al., 2016; Hoffmann et al., 2018; Kusaka et al., 2012; McCarthy et al., 2010, 2012; Oleson, 2012; 
Oleson et al., 2011; Sachindra et al., 2016). </p>

<p>Combining climate change conditions together with urban growth scenarios, there is very high confidence 
(robust evidence and high agreement) that future urbanization will amplify the projected air temperature 
warming irrespective of the background climate (Georgescu et al., 2013; Argüeso et al., 2014; Mahmood et 
al., 2014; Doan et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2016; Kusaka et al., 2016; Grossman-Clarke et al., 2017; Kaplan et 
al., 2017; Li et al., 2018c) Urbanization will have a strong influence on minimum temperatures that could be 
locally comparable in magnitude to the global GHG-induced warming (Berckmans et al., 2019). There is 
very high confidence (robust evidence and high agreement) for the combination of future urban development 
and more frequent occurrence of extreme climatic events, such as heat waves (Hamdi et al., 2016; Bader et al., 2018; He et al., 2021). </p>

<p>The choice of urban planning scenarios and RCM projections shows a large sensitivity during night-time, up 
to 0.6°C (Kusaka et al., 2016). The sensitivity is significantly less than the uncertainties arising from global 
emission scenarios or GCM projections. However, there is a large difference between RCM simulations with 
and without urban land use, indicating that this impact is comparable to the uncertainties related to the use of 
different GCM projections (Hamdi et al., 2014; Kusaka et al., 2016; Daniel et al., 2019). Therefore, impact 
assessments and adaptation plans for urban areas require high spatial resolution climate projections along 
with models that represent urban processes, ensemble dynamical and statistical downscaling, and local-
impact models (Masson et al., 2014; Baklanov et al., 2018, 2020; Duchêne et al., 2020; Schoetter et al., 
2020; Le Roy et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2021). </p>
