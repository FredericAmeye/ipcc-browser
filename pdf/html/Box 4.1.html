<p>AR5 used a pragmatic approach to quantify the uncertainty in CMIP5 GSAT projections (Collins et al., 
2013). The multi-model ensemble was constructed by picking one realization per model per scenario. For 
most quantities, the 5–95% ensemble range was used to characterize the uncertainty, but the 5–95% 
ensemble range was interpreted as the 17–83% (likely) uncertainty range. The uncertainty was thus explicitly 
assumed to contain sources not represented by the model range. While straightforward and clearly 
communicated, this approach had several drawbacks.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The uncertainty breakdown into scenario uncertainty, model uncertainty, and internal variability <br />
(Cox and Stephenson, 2007; Hawkins and Sutton, 2009) in the AR5 followed Hawkins and Sutton 
(2009) and diagnosed internal variability through a high-pass temporal filter (Kirtman et al., 2013), but 
it has since become clear that even multi-decadal trends contain substantial internal variability relative 
to the forced response in many variables (e.g., (Deser et al., 2012a; Marotzke and Forster, 2015; Deser 
et al., 2020; Lehner et al., 2020)); hence a more comprehensive approach is needed.  </p></li>
<li><p>The uncertainty characterization ignores observation-based information about internal climate 
variability during the most recent past, such as is used in initialized predictions. While this may matter 
little for the long-term projections (Collins et al., 2013), it is very important for the near-term future 
(Kirtman et al., 2013). AR5 included additional uncertainty quantification for the near-term 
projections (Kirtman et al., 2013), leading to a downward adjustment of assessed near-term GSAT 
change, which created an inconsistency in the transition from near-term to long-term GSAT 
assessment in the AR5.  </p></li>
<li><p>AR5 used the range of CMIP5 equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) side-by-side with the ECS likely range assessed from multiple lines of evidence (the CMIP5 ensemble, instrumental 
observations, and paleo-information, (Collins et al., 2013)). While the CMIP5 range in ECS and the 
AR5 ECS likely range did not differ much, the difference did create an inconsistency. Furthermore, 
AR5 WGIII used the assessed likely range for ECS in their calculations of carbon budgets (IPCC, 2014), and these uncertainties matter a great deal when assessing remaining carbon budgets consistent 
with limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels (Millar et al., 2017, 2018a, 2018b; 
Schurer et al., 2018)(Rogelj et al., 2018b).  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Another important consideration concerns the potential weighting of model contributions to an ensemble, 
based on model independence, model performance during the historical period, or both. Such model 
weighting (in fact, model selection) was performed in the AR5 for projections of Arctic sea ice (Collins et 
al., 2013), but that particular application has subsequently been shown by Notz (2015) to be contaminated by 
internal variability, making the resulting weighting questionable (see also Stroeve and Notz (2015)). For a 
general cautionary note, see Weigel et al. (2010). Approaches that take into account internal variability and 
model independence have been proposed since AR5 (Knutti et al., 2017; Boe, 2018; Abramowitz et al., 
2019; Brunner et al., 2020). </p>

<p>There are hence good reasons for basing an assessment of future global climate on lines of evidence in 
addition to the projection simulations. However, despite some progress, no universal, robust method for 
weighting a multi-model projection ensemble is available, and expert judgement must be included, as it did 
for AR5, in the assessment of the projections. The default in this chapter follows the AR5 approach for 
GSAT (Collins et al., 2013) and interprets the CMIP6 5–95% ensemble range as the likely uncertainty range.  </p>

<p>Additional lines of evidence enter the assessment particularly for the most important indicator of global 
climate change, GSAT. The CMIP6 ensemble generally shows larger projected warming by the end of the 
21st century, relative to the average over the period 1995–2014, than the CMIP5 ensemble (Section 4.3.1). 
The warming has increased in part because of models with higher ECS in CMIP6, compared to CMIP5 (e.g., 
Meehl et al., 2020; Tokarska et al., 2020; Zelinka et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020, high confidence), and in part 
because of higher ERF in CMIP6 than in CMIP5 (e.g., Tebaldi et al., 2021, Section 4.6.2). Because change 
in several other important climate quantities scales with change in GSAT (Section 4.2.4), bringing in 
additional lines of evidence is particularly important for the GSAT assessment.  </p>

<p>The Chapter 4 assessment uses information from the following sources:  </p>

<ol>
<li>The CMIP6 multi-model ensemble (Eyring et al., 2016), augmented if appropriate by the CMIP5 
ensemble (Taylor et al., 2012). </li>
<li>Single-model large initial-condition ensembles (e.g., Kay et al., 2015; Sigmond and Fyfe, 2016; 
Maher et al., 2019) and combinations of control runs with CMIP transient simulations (e.g., 
Thompson et al., 2015; Olonscheck and Notz, 2017) to characterize internal variability. Several 
analyses using multiple large ensembles have recently become available and add robustness to 
the results (Maher et al., 2018, 2019b, 2020; Deser et al., 2020; Lehner et al., 2020)(Maher et al., 
2021).  </li>
<li>Assessed best estimates, likely, and very likely ranges of ECS and TCR, from process 
understanding, warming in the instrumental record, paleoclimates, and emergent constraints 
(Chapter 7, Table 7.13, Table 7.14, Section 7.5). The ECS and TCR ranges are converted into 
GSAT ranges using as an emulator a two-layer energy balance model (EBM, e.g., Held et al., 
2010) that is driven by the effective radiative forcing (ERF) assessed in Chapter 7 (see Cross-
Chapter Box 7.1). Assuming for the ERF resulting from a doubling of the CO2 concentration, 
∆F2 • CO2=4.0 W m-2 (close to the best estimate of 3.93 W m-2, Section 7.3), and using the so-
called zero-layer approximation to the EBM (e.g., Marotzke and Forster, 2015; Jiménez-de-la-
Cuesta and Mauritsen, 2019) permits a one-to-one translation of any pair of ECS and TCR into a 
pair of climate feedback parameter α and ocean heat uptake coefficient κε, using the simple 
equations α=−∆F2 • CO2 ECS-1 and κε= ∆F2 • CO2 TCR-1 − ∆F2 • CO2 ECS-1 (e.g., Jiménez-de-la-
Cuesta and Mauritsen, 2019); see Chapter 7 for a detailed discussion). The results are displayed 
in Box 4.1, Figure 1 and are used in the synthesis GSAT assessment in Section 4.3.4. </li>
<li>Model independence diagnosed a priori, based on shared model components for atmosphere, 
ocean, land surface, and sea ice of CMIP5 models (Boe, 2018). CMIP5 models have been re-
sampled assuming that two models sharing either the atmosphere or the ocean component are 
effectively the same model (Maher et al., 2021). Downweighting CMIP5 models that share a component with another has substantial influence on diagnosed model agreement on change in 
ENSO (Maher et al., 2021), but has negligible influence (much less than 0.1°C) on the ensemble 
mean and range of GSAT change over the 21st century. No corresponding diagnosis exists yet 
for CMIP6 models, and no weighting based on a-priori independence is applied here.  </li>
<li>Performance in simulating the past and a-posteriori independence based on comparison against 
observations (Knutti et al., 2017; Abramowitz et al., 2019). This approach has been applied to 
CMIP6-simulated GSAT and has led to a substantial reduction in model range (Liang et al., 
2020, (Brunner et al., 2020), Section 4.3.4). CMIP6-simulated Arctic sea-ice area has been 
compared to the observed record, and models have been selected whose ensemble range across 
their individual realizations (Olonscheck and Notz, 2017) includes the observational range of 
uncertainty. A larger fraction of these selected simulations show an ice-free Arctic in September 
before 2050, compared to the entire CMIP6 ensemble (Notz and SIMIPCommunity, 2020, <br />
Section 4.3.2).   </li>
<li>A linear inverse method (kriging) has combined the entire GSAT record since 1850 with the 
CMIP6 historical simulations to produce constrained projections for the 21st century; again the 
reduction in range has been substantial (Ribes et al., 2021; Section 4.3.4).   </li>
<li>Emergent constraints (e.g., (Hall and Qu, 2006; Cox et al., 2018; Brient, 2020), which for the 
post-1970 warming have been applied to the CMIP5 (Jiménez-de-la-Cuesta and Mauritsen, 
2019) and CMIP6 ensembles (Nijsse et al., 2020; Tokarska et al., 2020) and have likewise led to 
a substantial reduction in GSAT ensemble range (Section 4.3.4).  </li>
<li>Climate predictions initialized from recent observations (e.g., Kirtman et al., 2013) and the Decadal Climate Prediction Project (DCPP) contribution to CMIP6 (Boer et al., 2016; Smith et 
al., 2020; Sospedra-Alfonso and Boer, 2020). Initialized predictions for the period 2019–2028 
exist for eight DCPP models and are used here (Box 4.1 Figure 1, Section 4.4.1). The DCPP 
results have been drift-removed and referenced to the time-averaged hindcasts for 1995–2014 
lead-year by lead-year, following (Kharin et al., 2012; Kruschke et al., 2016). </li>
</ol>

<p>Box 4.1 Figure 1 shows annual-mean GSAT simulated by CMIP6 models for both the historical period and 
forced by scenario SSP2-4.5 until 2100, combined with various characterizations of uncertainty. First, 
internal variability is estimated with the 50-member ensemble simulated with CanESM5. The 5–95% 
ensemble range for annual-mean GSAT in CanESM5 is slightly below 0.4°C; in other CMIP6 large 
ensembles this range is about 0.5°C (MIROC6, IPSL-CM6A) and slightly above 0.6°C (S-LENS/EC-
Earth3). The CMIP5 large ensemble MPI-GE shows a range of slightly below 0.5°C (Bengtsson and Hodges, 
2019), in reasonable agreement with observed variability (Maher et al., 2019b). There is thus high 
confidence in the CMIP6-simulated level of internal variability in annual-mean GSAT, as displayed in Box 
4.1, Figure 1.  </p>

<p>Second, Section 7.5 very likely ECS and TCR ranges are converted into GSAT ranges with the EBM as an 
emulator using, in this example, SSP2-4.5 radiative forcing information. Because the ECS and TCR 
assessments in Section 7.5 are based on multiple lines of evidence and the EBM physics are well understood, 
there is likewise high confidence in the EBM-emulated warming. Third, the initialized-forecast ensembles 
from eight CMIP6 DCPP models are shown in the inset, for the period 2019–2028. During this period, the 
initialized forecasts are consistent, within internal variability, with the EBM-emulated range, further adding 
to the high confidence in the assessed-GSAT range.  </p>

<p>The constrained range of GSAT change is useful for quantifying uncertainties in changes of other climate 
quanties that scale well with GSAT change, such as September Arctic sea-ice area, global-mean 
precipitation, and many climate extremes (Cross-Chapter Box 11.1). However, there are also quantities that 
do not scale linearly with GSAT change, such as global-mean land precipitation, atmospheric circulation, 
AMOC, and modes of variability, especially ENSO SST variability. Because we do not have robust scientific 
evidence to constrain changes in other quantities, uncertainty quantification for their changes is based on 
CMIP6 projections and expert judgement. For the assessment for changes in GMSL, the contribution from 
land-ice melt has been added offline to the CMIP6 simulated contributions from thermal expansion, 
consistent with Chapter 9 (see Section 9.6).    </p>
