<p>Increased atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions since the 19th century have led to a net positive radiative 
forcing of Earth’s climate (Sections 2.2, 7.3) and a corresponding accumulation of energy in the Earth 
System. Quantification of this energy gain is essential to our understanding of observed climate change and 
for estimates of climate sensitivity (Section 7.5). The global energy inventory is closely linked to our 
understanding of observed global sea-level change, through the energy associated with loss of land-based ice 
and the effect of thermal expansion associated with ocean warming (Box 9.1, Sections 2.3.3.1, 9.6.1; Table 
9.5).     </p>

<p>The Earth System gained substantial energy over the period 1971-2018 (high confidence), with an assessed 
very likely range of 325 to 546 ZJ or 0.43 to 0.72 W⋅m<sup>-2</sup> expressed per unit area of the Earth’s surface 
(Cross-Chapter Box 9.1, Figure 1a; Section 7.2, Box 7.2). Ocean warming dominates the energy inventory 
change (high confidence), accounting for 91% of the observed energy increase for the period 1971-2018, 
with upper ocean warming (0-700 m) accounting for 56% (Section 7.2). Much smaller amounts went into 
melting of ice (3%) and heating of the land (5%) and atmosphere (1%). Overall, the percentage contributions 
are similar to those reported in IPCC AR5 for the period 1971-2010 (Rhein et al., 2013). </p>

<p>The observed global mean sea-level (GMSL) budget is assessed through comparison of the sum of individual 
components of GMSL change with independent observations of total GMSL change from tide gauge and 
satellite altimeter observations (Cross-Chapter Box 9.1, Figure 1b; Sections 2.3.3, 9.6.1; Table 9.5). The 
assessed sum of the observed components indicates that GMSL very likely increased by 72 to 117 mm over 
the period 1971-2018 (Table 9.5), with the largest contributions from ocean thermal expansion (50%) and 
melting of ice sheets and glaciers (42%). The assessed total GMSL change (Section 2.3.3) for the period 
1971-2018 has a very likely range of 73-146 mm and as a result the sea-level budget is closed for this period 
(Cross-Chapter Box 9.1, Figure 1b, Section 9.6.1, Table 9.5).  </p>

<p>The sea-level budget closure demonstrates improved quantification of the processes of observed GMSL 
change for this period relative to previous IPCC assessments (Church et al., 2013a; Oppenheimer et al., 
2019). A related assessment presented in Chapter 7 demonstrates closure of the global energy budget (high 
confidence) (Box 7.2) and strengthens the confidence in scientific understanding of both of these key aspects 
of climate change.   </p>
