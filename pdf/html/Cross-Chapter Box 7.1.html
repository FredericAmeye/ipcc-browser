<p>Climate model emulators are simple physically-based models that are used to approximate large-scale 
climate responses of complex Earth System Models (ESMs). Due to their low computational cost they can 
populate or span wide uncertainty ranges that ESMs cannot. They need to be calibrated to do this and, once 
calibrated, they can aid inter-ESM comparisons and act as ESM extrapolation tools to reflect and combine 
knowledge from ESMs and many other lines of evidence (Geoffroy et al., 2013a; Good et al., 2013; Smith et 
al., 2018a). In AR6, the term 'climate model emulator' (or simply emulator) is preferred over 'simple’ or 
‘reduced-complexity climate model' to reinforce their use as specifically calibrated tools (Cross-Chapter Box 
7.1, Figure 1). Nonetheless, simple physically-based climate models have a long history of use in previous 
IPCC reports (Chapter 1, Section 1.5.3.4). Climate model emulators can include carbon and other gas cycles 
and can combine uncertainties along the cause-effect chain from emissions to temperature response. 
AR5(Collins et al., 2013a) used the MAGICC6 emulator  (Meinshausen et al., 2011a) in a probabilistic setup 
(Meinshausen et al., 2009) to explore the uncertainty in future projections. A simple impulse response 
emulator (Good et al., 2011) was also used to ensure a consistent set of ESM projections could be shown 
across a range of scenarios. AR5 WGI Chapter 8 (Myhre et al., 2013b) employed a two-layer emulator for 
quantifying Global Temperature Potentials (GTP). In AR5 WGIII (Clarke et al., 2014), MAGICC6 was also 
used for the classification of scenarios, and in AR5 Synthesis Report (IPCC, 2014) this information was used 
to estimate carbon budgets. In SR1.5, two emulators were used to provide temperature projections of 
scenarios: the MAGICC6 model, which was used for the scenario classification, and the FaIR1.3 model 
(Millar et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2018a).  </p>

<p>SR1.5 found that the physically-based emulators produced different projected non-CO2 forcing and 
identified the largely unexplained differences between the two emulators used as a key knowledge gap 
(Forster et al., 2018). This led to a renewed effort to test the skill of various emulators. The Reduced 
Complexity Model Intercomparison Project (RCMIP; Nicholls et al. (2020)) found that the latest generation 
of the emulators can reproduce key characteristics of the observed changes in global surface air temperature 
(GSAT) together with other key responses of ESMs (Cross-Chapter Box 7.1, Figure 1a). In particular, 
despite their reduced structural complexity, some emulators are able to replicate the non-linear aspects of 
ESM GSAT response over a range of scenarios. GSAT emulation has been more thoroughly explored in the 
literature than other types of emulation. Structural differences between emulation approaches lead to 
different outcomes and there are problems with emulating particular ESMs. In conclusion, there is medium 
confidence that emulators calibrated to single ESM runs can reproduce ESM projections of the forced GSAT 
response to other similar emissions scenarios to within natural variability (Meinshausen et al., 2011b; 
Geoffroy et al., 2013a; Dorheim et al., 2020; Nicholls et al., 2020; Tsutsui, 2020), although larger differences 
can remain for scenarios with very different forcing characteristics. For variables other than GSAT there has 
not yet been a comprehensive effort to evaluate the performance of emulators. </p>

<h3>Application of emulators in AR6 WGI</h3>

<p>Cross-Chapter Box 7.1 Table 1 shows the use of emulators within the WGI Report. The main use of 
emulation in the Report is to estimate GSAT change from Effective Radiative Forcing (ERF) or 
concentration changes, where various versions of a two layer energy budget emulator are used. The two-
layer emulator is equivalent to a two-timescale impulse response model (Geoffroy et al., 2013b, 
Supplementary Material 7.SM.2). Both a single configuration version and probabilistic forms are used. The 
emulator is an extension of the energy budget equation (Equation 7.1) and allows for heat exchange between 
the upper- and deeper-ocean layers, mimicking the ocean heat uptake that reduces the rate of surface 
warming under radiative forcing (Gregory, 2000; Held et al., 2010; Winton et al., 2010; Armour, 2017; 
Mauritsen and Pincus, 2017; Rohrschneider et al., 2019). Although the same energy budget emulator 
approach is used, different calibrations are employed in various sections, to serve different purposes and 
keep lines of evidence as independent as possible. Chapter 9 additionally employs projections of ocean heat 
content from the Chapter 7 two-layer emulator to estimate the thermostatic component to future sea-level 
rise (see Chapter 9, Section 9.6.3 and Supplementary Material 7.SM.2). </p>

<p>Emission-driven emulators, as opposed to ERF- or concentration-driven emulators are also used in the 
Report. In Chapter 4 (Section 4.6) MAGICC7 is used to emulate GSAT beyond 2100 since its long-term 
response has been assessed to be fit-for-purpose to represent the behaviour of ESMs. In Chapter 5 (Section 
5.5) MAGICC7 is used to explore the non-CO2 GSAT contribution in emissions scenarios. In Chapter 6 and 
Chapter 7 (Section 7.6), two-layer model configurations were tuned to match the probabilistic GSAT 
responses of FaIRv1.6.2 and MAGICC7 emission-driven emulators. For Chapter 6 the two median values 
from FaIRv1.6.2 and MAGICC7 emulators are averaged and then matched to the best-estimate ECS of 3°C 
and TCR of 1.8 °C (Table 7.13 and Table 7.14) under the best-estimate ERF due to a doubling of CO2 of 
3.93 W m-2 (Table 7.4). For Section 7.6 a distribution of responses are used from the two emulators to 
estimate uncertainties in Global Temperature-change Potentials.  </p>

<h3>Emission-driven emulators for scenario classification in AR6 WGIII</h3>

<p>As in AR5 and SR1.5, emission-driven emulators are used to communicate outcomes of the physical climate 
science assessment and uncertainties to quantify the temperature outcome associated with different emission 
scenarios. In particular, the computational efficiency of these emulators allows the analysis of a large 
number of multi-gas emissions scenarios in terms of multiple characteristics, e.g., year of peak temperature 
or the 2030 emission levels in line with keeping global warming to below 1.5°C or 2.0 oC.  </p>

<p>Four emission-driven emulators have been considered as tools for WGIII to explore the range of GSAT 
response to multiple scenarios beyond those assessed in WGI. The four emulators are CICERO-SCM (Skeie 
et al., 2017, 2021), FaIRv1.6.2 (Millar et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2018a), MAGICC7 (Meinshausen et al., 
2009) and OSCARv3.1.1 (Gasser et al., 2017a, 2020). Each emulator's probabilistic distribution has been 
calibrated to capture the relationship between emissions and GSAT change. The calibration is informed by 
the WGI assessed ranges of ECS, TCR, historical GSAT change, ERF, carbon cycle metrics and future 
warming projections under the (concentration-driven) SSP scenarios. The emulators are then provided as a 
tool for WGIII to perform a GSAT-based classification of mitigation scenarios consistent with the physical 
understanding assessed in WGI.. The calibration step reduced the emulator differences identified in SR1.5. 
Note that evaluation of both central and range estimates of each emulator’s probabilistic projections is 
important to assess the fitness-for-purpose for the classification of scenarios in WGIII based on information 
beyond the central estimate of GSAT warming.  </p>

<p><figref>Cross-Chapter Box 7.1,Figure1</figref> </p>

<p>MAGICC7 and FaIRv1.6.2 emission based emulators are able to represent the WGI assessment  to within <br />
small differences (defined here as within typical rounding precisions of ±5% for central estimates and ±10% 
for ranges) across more than 80% of metric ranges (Cross-Chapter Box 7.1, Table 2 below). Both calibrated 
emulators are consistent with assessed ranges of ECS, historical GSAT, historical ocean heat uptake, total 
greenhouse gas ERF, methane ERF and the majority of the assessed SSP warming ranges. FaIRv1.6.2 also 
matches the assessed central value of TCRE and airborne fraction. Whereas, MAGICC7 matches the 
assessed TCR ranges as well as providing a closer fit to the SSP warming ranges for the lower emission 
scenarios. In the evaluation framework considered here, CICERO-SCM represents historical warming to 
within 2% of the assessed ranges and also represents future temperatures ranges across the majority of the 
assessment although it lacks the representation of the carbon cycle. In this framework, OSCARv3.1.1 is less 
able to represent the assessed projected GSAT ranges although it matches the range of airborne fraction 
estimates closely and the assessed historical GSAT likely range to within 0.5%. Despite these identified 
limitations, both CICERO-SCM and OSCARv3.1.1 provide additional information for evaluating the 
sensitivity of scenario classification to model choice. </p>

<p>How emulators match the assessed ranges used for the evaluation framework is summarised here and in 
Table 2. The first is too low projections in 2081–2100 under SSP1-1.9 (8% or 15% too low for the central 
estimate and 15% or 25% too low for the lower end in the case of MAGICC7 or FaIRv1.6.2, respectively). 
The second is the representation of the aerosol effective radiative forcing (both MAGICC7 and FaIRv1.6.2 
are greater than 8% less negative than the central assessed range and  greater than 10% less negative for the 
lower assessed range), as energy balance models struggle to reproduce an aerosol ERF with a magnitude as 
strong as the assessed best estimate and still match historical warming estimates. Both emulators have 
medium to large differences compared to the TCRE and airborne fraction ranges (see note of Table 2). 
Finally, there is also a slight overestimate of the low-end of the assessed historical GSAT range.  </p>

<p>Overall, there is high confidence that emulated historical and future ranges of GSAT change can be 
calibrated to be internally-consistent with the assessment of key physical-climate indicators in this Report: 
greenhouse gas ERFs, ECS and TCR. When calibrated to match the assessed ranges of GSAT and multiple 
physical climate indicators, physically-based emulators can reproduce the best estimate of GSAT change 
over 1850–1900 to 1995–2014 to within 5% and very likely range of this GSAT change to within 10%. 
MAGICC7 and FaIRv1.6.2 match at least two-thirds of the Chapter 4 assessed projected GSAT changes to 
within these levels of precision.  </p>
