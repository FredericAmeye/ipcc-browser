<p>Global  land  monsoon  precipitation  decreased  from  the  1950s  to  the  1980s,  partly  due  to  anthropogenic 
aerosols, but has increased since then in response to GHG forcing and large-scale multi-decadal variability 
(medium  confidence).  Northern  Hemispheric  anthropogenic  aerosols  weakened  the  regional  monsoon 
circulations  in  South  Asia,  East  Asia  and  West  Africa  during  the  second  half  of  the  20th  century,  thereby 
offsetting the expected strengthening of monsoon precipitation in response to GHG-induced warming (high 
confidence). During the 21st century, global land monsoon precipitation is projected to increase in response to 
GHG warming in all time horizons and scenarios (high confidence). Over South and Southeast Asia, East Asia 
and the central Sahel, monsoon precipitation is projected to increase, whereas over North America and the far 
western  Sahel  it  is  projected  to  decrease  (medium  confidence).  There  is  low  confidence  in  projected 
precipitation  changes  in  the  South  American  and  Australian-Maritime  Continent  monsoons.  At  global  and 
regional scales, near-term monsoons changes will be dominated by the effects of internal variability (medium 
confidence). {2.3, Cross-Chapter Box 2.4, 3.3, 4.4, 4.5, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, Box 8.1, Box 8.2, 10.6} </p>

<h2>Global Monsoon</h2>

<p>Paleoclimate  records  indicate  that  during  warm  climates,  like  the  mid-Pliocene  Warm  Period,  monsoon 
systems were stronger (medium confidence). In the instrumental records, global summer monsoon precipitation 
intensity has likely increased since the 1980s, dominated by Northern Hemisphere summer trends and large 
multi-decadal  variability.  Contrary  to  the  expected  increase  of  precipitation  under  global  warming,  the 
Northern Hemisphere monsoon regions experienced declining precipitation from the 1950s to 1980s, which is 
partly  attributable  to  the  influence  of  anthropogenic  aerosols  (medium  confidence)  (Box TS.13,  Figure 1). 
{2.3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 2.4, 3.3.2, 3.3.3} </p>

<p>With continued global warming, it is likely that global land monsoon precipitation will increase during this 
century (Box TS.13, Figure 1), particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, although the monsoon circulation is 
projected  to  weaken.  A  slowdown  of  the  tropical  circulation  with  global  warming  can  partly  offset  the 
warming-induced strengthening of precipitation in monsoon regions (high confidence). In the near term, global 
monsoon  changes  are  likely  to  be  dominated  by  the  effects  of  internal  variability  and  model  uncertainties 
(medium  confidence).  In  the  long  term,  global  monsoon  rainfall  change  will  feature  a  robust  north-south 
asymmetry characterized by a greater increase in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere 
and  an  east-west  asymmetry  characterized  by  enhanced  Asian-African  monsoons  and  a  weakened  North 
American monsoon (medium confidence). {4.4.1, 4.5.1, 8.4.1} </p>

<h2>Regional Monsoons</h2>

<p>Paleoclimate reconstructions indicate stronger monsoons in the Northern Hemisphere but weaker ones in the 
Southern Hemisphere during warm periods, particularly for the South and Southeast Asian, East Asian, North 
and South American monsoons, with the opposite occurring during cold periods (medium confidence). It is 
very likely that Northern Hemispheric anthropogenic aerosols weakened the regional monsoon circulations in 
South  Asia,  East  Asia  and  West  Africa  during  the  second  half  of  the  20th  century,  thereby  offsetting  the 
expected strengthening of monsoon precipitation in response to GHG-induced warming (Box TS.13, Figure 
1). Multiple lines of evidence explain this contrast over South Asia, with the observed trends dominated by 
the  effects  of  aerosols,  while  future  projections  are  mostly  driven  by  GHG  increases.  The  recent  partial 
recovery and enhanced intensity of monsoon precipitation over West Africa is related to the growing influence 
of GHGs with an additional contribution due to the reduced cooling effect of anthropogenic aerosols, emitted 
largely from North America and Europe (medium confidence). For other regional monsoons, that is, North and 
South America and Australia, there is low confidence in the attribution of recent changes in precipitation (Box TS.13, Figure 1) and winds {2.3.1, 8.3.1, 8.3.2, Box 8.1, 10.6.3} </p>

<p>Projections  of  regional  monsoons  during  the  21st  century  indicate  contrasting  (region-dependent)  and 
uncertain precipitation and circulation changes. The annual contrast between the wettest and driest month of 
the year is likely to increase by 3–5% per degree Celsius in most monsoon regions in terms of precipitation, 
precipitation  minus  evaporation,  and  runoff  (medium  confidence).  For  the  North  American  monsoon, 
projections indicate a decrease in precipitation, whereas increased monsoon rainfall is projected over South 
and Southeast Asia and over East Asia (medium confidence) (Box TS.13, Figure 1). West African monsoon 
precipitation is projected to increase over the central Sahel and decrease over the far western Sahel (medium 
confidence). There is low confidence in projected precipitation changes in the South American and Australian-
Maritime Continent regional monsoons (for both magnitude or sign) (Box TS.13, Figure 1). There is medium 
confidence that the monsoon season will be delayed in the Sahel and high confidence that it will be delayed in 
North and South America. {8.2.2, 8.4.2.4, Box 8.2} </p>

<h2>Building the Assessment from Multiple Lines of Evidence</h2>

<p>Large  natural  variability  of  monsoon  precipitation  across  different  time  scales,  found  in  both  paleoclimate 
reconstructions and instrumental measurements, poses an inherent challenge for robust quantification of future 
changes  in  precipitation  at  regional  and  smaller  spatial  scales.  At  both  global  and  regional  scales,  there  is 
medium confidence that internal variability contributes the largest uncertainty related to projected changes, at 
least in the near term (2021–2040). A collapse of the Atlantic Multidecadal Overturning Circulation (AMOC) 
could  weaken  the  African  and  Asian  monsoons  but  strengthen  the  Southern  Hemisphere  monsoons  (high 
confidence). {4.4.4, Cross-Chapter Box 4.1, 4.5.1, 8.5.2, 8.6.1, 9.2.3, 10.6.3} </p>

<p>Overall,  long-term  (2081–2100)  future  changes  in  regional  monsoons  like  the  South  and  Southeast  Asian 
monsoon are generally consistent across global (including high-resolution) and regional climate models and 
supported  by  theoretical  arguments.  Uncertainties  in  simulating  the  observed  characteristics  of  regional 
monsoon precipitation are related to varying complexities of regional monsoon processes and their responses 
to  external  forcing,  internal  variability,  and  deficiencies  in  representing  monsoon  warm  rain  processes, 
organized tropical convection, heavy orographic rainfall and cloud–aerosol interactions. {8.3.2, 8.5.1, 10.3.3,
