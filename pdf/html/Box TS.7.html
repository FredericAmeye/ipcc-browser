<p>Future changes in emissions of short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) are expected to cause an additional 
global mean warming with a large diversity in the end-of-century response across the WGI core set of SSPs, 
depending upon the level of climate change and air pollution mitigation. This additional warming is either 
due to reductions in cooling aerosols for air pollution regulation or due to increases in methane, ozone and 
HFCs. This additional warming is stable after 2040 in SSPs associated with lower global air pollution as long 
as methane emissions are also mitigated, but the overall warming induced by SLCF changes is higher in 
scenarios in which air quality continues to deteriorate (induced by growing fossil fuel use and limited air 
pollution control) (high confidence). Sustained methane mitigation reduces global surface ozone, 
contributing to air quality improvements and also reduces surface temperature in the longer term, but only 
sustained CO2 emission reductions allow long-term climate stabilization (high confidence). Future changes 
in air quality (near-surface ozone and particulate matter, or PM) at global and local scales are predominantly 
driven by changes in ozone and aerosol precursor emissions rather than climate (high confidence). Air 
quality improvements driven by rapid decarbonization strategies, as in SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6, are not 
sufficient in the near term to achieve air quality guidelines set by the World Health Organization in some 
highly polluted regions (high confidence). Additional policies (e.g., access to clean energy, waste 
management) envisaged to attain United Nations Sustainable Development Goals bring complementary 
SLCF reduction. {4,4,4, 6.6.3, 6.7.3, BOX TS.7 Figure 1, Box 6.2} </p>

<p>The net effect of SLCF emissions changes on temperature will depend on how emissions of warming and 
cooling SLCFs will evolve in the future. The magnitude of the cooling effect of aerosols remains the largest 
uncertainty in the effect of SLCFs in future climate projections. Since the SLCFs have undergone large 
changes over the past two decades, the temperature and air pollution responses are estimated relative to year 
2019 instead of 1995–2014.  </p>

<h3>Temperature Response</h3>

<p>In the next two decades, it is very likely that SLCF emission changes will cause a warming relative to 2019, 
across the WGI core set of SSPs (see TS.1.3.1), in addition to the warming from long-lived GHGs. The net 
effect of SLFC and HFC changes in global surface temperature across the SSPs is a likely warming of 
0.06°C–0.35°C in 2040 relative to 2019. This near-term global mean warming linked to SLCFs is quite 
similar in magnitude across the SSPs due to competing effects of warming (methane, ozone) and cooling 
(aerosols) forcers (Box TS.7, Figure 1). There is greater diversity in the end-of-century response among the 
scenarios. SLCF changes in scenarios with no climate change mitigation (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) will cause 
a warming in the likely range of 0.4°C–0.9°C in 2100 relative to 2019 due to increases in methane, 
tropospheric ozone and HFC levels. For the stringent climate change and pollution mitigation scenarios 
(SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6), the cooling from reductions in methane, ozone and HFCs partially balances the 
warming from reduced aerosols, primarily sulphate, and the overall SLCF effect is a likely increase in global 
surface temperature of 0.0°C–0.3°C in 2100, relative to 2019. With intermediate climate change and air 
pollution mitigations, SLCFs in SSP2-4.5 add a likely warming of 0.2°C–0.5°C to global surface temperature 
change in 2100, with the largest warming resulting from reductions in aerosols. {4.4.4, 6.7.3} </p>

<p>Assuming implementation and efficient enforcement of both the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol 
on Ozone Depleting Substances and current national plans limit emissions (as in SSP1-2.6), the effects of 
HFCs on global surface temperature, relative to 2019, would remain below +0. 02°C from 2050 onwards 
versus about +0.04°C–0.08°C in 2050 and +0.1°C–0.3°C in 2100 considering only national HFC regulations 
decided prior to the Kigali Amendment (as in SSP5-8.5) (medium confidence). {6.6.3, 6.7.3}  </p>

<h3>Air Quality Responses</h3>

<p>Air pollution projections range from strong reductions in global surface ozone and PM (e.g., SSP1-2.6, with 
stringent mitigation of both air pollution and climate change) to no improvement and even degradation (e.g., 
SSP3-7.0 without climate change mitigation and with only weak air pollution control) (high confidence). 
Under the SSP3-7.0 scenario, PM levels are projected to increase until 2050 over large parts of Asia, and 
surface ozone pollution is projected to worsen over all continental areas through 2100 (high confidence). In 
SSP5-8.5, a scenario without climate change mitigation but with stringent air pollution control, PM levels 
decline through 2100, but high methane levels hamper the decline in global surface ozone at least until 2080 
(high confidence). {6.7.1} </p>
