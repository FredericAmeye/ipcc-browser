<p>The main objective of CORDEX-CORE is to provide a global homogeneous foundation of high-resolution 
RCM projections to improve understanding of local phenomena and facilitate impact and adaptation research 
worldwide (Gutowski Jr. et al., 2016). The experimental framework is designed to produce homogeneous 
regional projections for most inhabited land regions using nine CORDEX domains at 0.22Â° resolution 
(Figure Atlas.6): North, Central and South America (NAM, CAM, SAM), Europe (EUR), Africa (AFR), 
East, South and Southeast Asia (EAS, WAS, SEA) and Australasia (AUS). Due to computational 
requirements, three GCMs were selected to drive the simulations, HADGEM2-ES, MPI-ESM, and NorESM 
covering, respectively the spread of high, medium and low equilibrium climate sensitivities from the CMIP5 
ensemble at a global scale (with MIROC5, EC-Earth, GFDL-ES2M as secondary GCMs) focusing on two 
scenarios RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 (see Box Atlas.1, Figure 1). Two RCMs have contributed so far to this 
initiative (REMO and RegCM4) constituting an initial homogeneous downscaled ensemble to analyse mean 
climate change signals and hazards (Teichmann et al., 2020; Coppola et al., 2021), and there are ongoing 
efforts to extend the CORDEX-CORE ensemble with additional regional simulations (e.g., the COSMO-
CLM community) to increase the ensemble size. CORDEX-CORE simulations are distributed as part of the 
information available for the different CORDEX domains at the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF). </p>

<p>CORDEX-CORE spans the spread of the CMIP5 climate change signals for interquartile ranges of annual 
mean temperature and precipitation for most of the reference regions covered (Teichmann et al., 2020)(see 
Box Atlas.1, Figure 1). However, it is still a small ensemble and for other variables like extremes or climatic 
impact-drivers has only been partially investigated in Coppola et al. (2021) and needs further analysis. </p>
