<h3>What is permafrost carbon and why should we be concerned about it?</h3>

<p>Soils in the Arctic and other cold regions contain perennially frozen layers, known as permafrost. Soils in the northern permafrost region store a large amount of organic carbon, estimated at 1460–1600 PgC across both 
surface soils and deeper deposits (Hugelius et al., 2014; Strauss et al., 2017; Mishra et al., 2021). Of that 
carbon, permafrost soils and deposits store 1070–1360 PgC, of which 300–400 PgC are in the first meter, 
and the rest at depth. The remaining 280–340 Pg C are in permafrost-free soils within the permafrost region. 
These carbon deposits have accumulated over thousands of years due to the slow rates of organic matter 
decomposition in frozen and/or waterlogged soil layers, but these frozen soils are highly decomposable upon 
thaw (Schädel et al., 2014).  </p>

<h3>Is permafrost carbon already thawing and emitting greenhouse gases?</h3>

<p>The permafrost region was a historic carbon sink over centuries to millennia (high confidence) (Loisel et al., 
2014; Lindgren et al., 2018). Currently though, thawing soils due to anthropogenic warming are losing 
carbon from the decomposition of old frozen organic matter, as found via 14C signature of respiration at sites 
undergoing rapid permafrost thaw (Hicks Pries et al., 2013), of dissolved organic carbon in rivers draining 
watersheds with permafrost thaw (Vonk et al., 2015; Wild et al., 2019), and of CH4 produced in thawing 
lakes (Walter Anthony et al., 2016). </p>

<p>Despite accumulating evidence of increased carbon losses, it is difficult to scale up site- and ecosystem-level 
measurements to assess the net carbon balance over the entire permafrost region, due to the high spatial 
heterogeneity, the strong seasonal cycles and the difficulty in monitoring these regions consistently across 
the year. SROCC assessed with high confidence both that ecosystems in the permafrost region act as carbon 
sinks during the summer growing season, and that wintertime carbon losses are significant, consistent with a 
multi-decadal small increase in CO2 emissions during early winter at Barrow, Alaska (Sweeney et al., 2016; 
Webb et al., 2016; Meredith et al., 2019). These findings have been further strengthened by recent 
comprehensive synthesis of in-situ wintertime flux observations that show large carbon losses during the 
non-growing season (Natali et al., 2019). Increased autumn and winter respiration are a key large-scale 
fingerprint of top-down permafrost thaw predicted by ecosystem models (Parazoo et al., 2018). However, the 
length of these wintertime observational records is too short to unequivocally determine whether winter 
carbon losses are higher now than they used to be. One study inferred a multi-year net CO2 source for the 
tundra in Alaska (Commane et al., 2017), which is equivalent to 0.3 PgC yr-1 when scaled up to the northern 
permafrost region (low confidence) (Meredith et al., 2019). </p>

<p>Since the AR5, evidence of a more active carbon cycle in the northern high latitude regions has also been 
observed through the increased amplitude of CO2 seasonal cycles. However, the relative roles of local 
sources versus influence from mid-latitudes makes it difficult to infer changes to Arctic ecosystems from 
these observations (Graven et al., 2013; Forkel et al., 2016; Takata et al., 2017; Bruhwiler et al., 2021). 
Estimates of CO2 fluxes with atmospheric inversion models showed an enhanced seasonal cycle amplitude 
but no significant trends in annual total fluxes, in agreement with flux tower measurements over one decade 
(2004–2013) (Welp et al., 2016; Takata et al., 2017).  </p>

<p>In addition to CO2, CH4 emissions from the northern permafrost region contribute to the global methane 
budget, but evidence as to whether these emissions have increased from thawing permafrost is mixed. 
SROCC assigned low confidence to the degree of recent additional methane emissions from diverse sources 
throughout the permafrost region. These include observed regional lake area change, which suggest a 1.6–5 
Tg CH4 yr–1 increase over the last 50 years (Walter Anthony et al., 2016), ice-capped geological sources 
(Walter Anthony et al., 2012; Kohnert et al., 2017), and shallow Arctic Ocean shelves. The shallow subsea 
emissions are particularly uncertain due to both the wide range of estimates (3 Tg CH4 yr–1(Thornton et al., 
2016a) to 17 Tg CH4 yr–1 (Shakhova et al., 2014)), and the lack of a baseline with which to infer any 
changes; the upper half of this range in flux estimates is, however, inconsistent with the atmospheric 
inversions constrained by the pan-Arctic CH4 concentration measurements (Berchet et al., 2016).  </p>

<p>Atmospheric measurements and inversions performed at the global and regional scales do not show any 
detectable trends in annual mean CH4 emissions from the permafrost region over the past 30 years (Jackson 
et al., 2020; Saunois et al., 2020; Bruhwiler et al., 2021), consistent with atmospheric measurements in 
Alaska that showed no significant annual trends despite significant increase in air temperature (Sweeney et al., 2016). Atmospheric inversions and biospheric models do not show any clear trends in CH4 emission for 
wetland regions of the high latitudes during the period 2000–2016 (Patra et al., 2016; Poulter et al., 2017; 
Jackson et al., 2020; Saunois et al., 2020). Large uncertainties on wetland extent and limited data constraints 
place low confidence in these modeling approaches. </p>

<p>SROCC also assessed with high confidence that methane fluxes have been under-observed due to their high 
variability at multiple scales in both space and time, and that there is a persistent mismatch between top-
down and bottom-up methane budgets, with emissions calculated by upscaling ground observations typically 
higher than emissions inferred from large-scale atmospheric observations (Thornton et al., 2016b). </p>

<p>In conclusion, there is high confidence that the permafrost region has acted as a historic carbon sink over 
centuries to millennia and high confidence that some permafrost regions are currently net sources of CO2. 
There is robust evidence that some CH4 emissions sources and for some regions have increased over the past 
decades (medium confidence). For the northern permafrost-wide region, no multi-decadal trend has been 
detected on CO2 and CH4 fluxes but given the low resolution and sparse observations of current observations 
and modeling sytems, we place low confidence in this statement. </p>

<p>Since AR5, there have been new studies showing that permafrost thaw also leads to N2O release from soil 
(Abbott and Jones, 2015; Karelin et al., 2017; Wilkerson et al., 2019), a previously unaccounted source. 
However, this release is unquantified at the pan-Arctic scale. </p>

<h3>What does the paleo record tell us about how much emissions to expect?</h3>

<p>Large areas of Alaska and Siberia are underlain by frozen, glacial-age, ice- and carbon-rich deposits, and 
many of these areas show evidence of thermokarst processes during Holocene warm periods. Rapid warming 
of high northern latitudes contributed to permafrost thaw, liberating labile organic carbon to the atmosphere 
(Köhler et al., 2014; Crichton et al., 2016; Winterfeld et al., 2018; Meyer et al., 2019), supporting the 
vulnerability of these areas to further warming (Strauss et al., 2013, 2017).  </p>

<p>Radiogenic and stable isotopic measurements on CH4 trapped in Antarctic ice support the view that CH4 
emissions from fossil carbon reservoirs, including permafrost and methane hydrates, in response to the 
deglacial warming remained small. Mass-balance calculations reveal that geological CH4 emissions have not 
exceeded 19 Tg yr-1, highlighting that the deglacial increase in CH4 emissions were predominantly related to 
contemporary methane emissions from tropical wetlands and seasonally inundated floodplains (Bock et al., 
2017; Petrenko et al., 2017; Dyonisius et al., 2020). Isotopic constraints on CO2 losses from permafrost with 
warming after the Last Glacial Maximumm (LGM) are weaker than for CH4. While the biosphere as a whole 
held less carbon during LGM than the preindustrial, that change in stocks was smaller than the change in 
plant productivity, and so carbon losses at high latitudes may have been offset by increased tropical 
productivity in response to warming during the last deglacial transition (LDT) (Ciais et al., 2012b). There is 
also paleoclimate evidence for processes that mitigate carbon losses with warming on longer timescales, 
such as longer-term carbon accumulation in lake deposits following thermokarst thaw (Walter Anthony et 
al., 2014), and long-term accumulation of carbon in permafrost soils following LDT carbon loss (Lindgren et 
al., 2018), particularly in peatlands which accumulated carbon at a slow but persistent rate in warm 
paleoclimates (Treat et al., 2019). </p>

<p>In conclusion, several independent lines of evidence indicate that permafrost thaw did not release vast 
quantities of fossil CH4 associated with the transient warming events of the LDT, suggesting that large 
emissions of CH4 from old carbon sources will not to occur in response to future warming (medium 
confidence).  </p>

<h3>How much emissions do we expect in the future?</h3>

<p>Near-surface permafrost is projected to decrease significantly under future global warming scenarios (high 
confidence, Section 9.5.2), thus creating the potential for releasing CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere, and act 
as a positive carbon-climate feedback.   </p>

<p>The processes that govern permafrost carbon loss are grouped into gradual and abrupt mechanisms. Gradual 
processes include the deepening of the seasonally-thawed active layer into perennially-frozen permafrost 
layers and lengthening of the thawed season within the active layer, which increases the amount of organic 
carbon that is thawed and the duration of thaw. Abrupt thaw processes include ice-wedge polygon 
degradation, hillslope collapse, thermokarst lake expansion and draining, all of which are processes largely 
occurring in regions with very high soil carbon content (Olefeldt et al., 2016a, 2016b). Abrupt thaw 
processes can contribute up to half of the total net greenhouse gas release from permafrost loss, the rest 
attributed to gradual thaw (Schneider von Deimling et al., 2015; Turetsky et al., 2020). Increased fire 
frequency and severity (Hu et al., 2010) also contributes to abrupt emissions and the removal of the 
insulating cover which leads to an acceleration of permafrost thaw (Genet et al., 2013).  Ecological 
feedbacks can both mitigate and amplify carbon losses: nutrient release from increased organic matter 
decomposition can drive vegetation growth that partially offsets soil carbon losses (Salmon et al., 2016), but 
also lead to biophysical feedbacks that further amplify warming (Myers-Smith et al., 2011). </p>

<p>Through CMIP5, Earth system models (ESMs) had not included permafrost carbon dynamics. This remains 
largely true in CMIP6, with most models not representing permafrost carbon processes, a small number 
representing the active-layer thickening effect on decomposition (Table 5.4), and no ESMs representing 
thermokarst or fire-permafrost-carbon interactions. The CMIP6 ensemble mean predicts a negative carbon-
climate feedback in the permafrost region. However, those that do include permafrost carbon show a positive 
carbon-climate feedback in the permafrost region (Figure 5.27). Given the current limited ESM capacity to 
assess permafrost feedbacks, estimates in this report are based on published permafrost-enabled land surface 
model results. </p>

<p>SROCC assessed that warming under a high emission scenario (RCP8.5 or similar) would result in a loss of 
permafrost carbon by 2100 of 10s to 100s of PgC, with a maximum estimate of 240 PgC and a best estimate 
of 92 ± 17  PgC (Meredith et al., 2019) (SROCC, Figure 3.11). Under lower emissions scenarios, Schneider 
von Deimling et al., (2015) estimated permafrost feedbacks of 20–58 PgC of CO2 by 2100 under a RCP2.6 
scenario, and 28–92 PgC of CO2 under a RCP4.5 scenario.   </p>

<p>This new assessment, based on studies included in or published since SROCC (Schaefer et al., 2014; Koven 
et al., 2015c; Schneider von Deimling et al., 2015; Schuur et al., 2015; MacDougall and Knutti, 2016a; 
Gasser et al., 2018; Yokohata et al., 2020), estimates that the permafrost CO2 feedback per degree of global 
warming (Figure 5.29) is 18 (3.1–41, 5th–95th percentile range) PgC ºC-1. The assessment is based on a wide 
range of scenarios evaluated at 2100, and an assessed estimate of the permafrost CH4-climate feedback at 2.8 
(0.7–7.3 5th–95th percentile range) Pg Ceq ºC-1 (Figure 5.29). This feedback affects the remaining carbon 
budgets for climate stabilisation and is included in their assessment (Section 5.5.2).   </p>

<p>Beyond 2100, models suggest that the magnitude of the permafrost carbon feedback strengthens 
considerably over the period 2100–2300 under a high-emissions scenario (Schneider von Deimling et al., 
2015; McGuire et al., 2018). Schneider von Deimling et al., (2015) estimated that thawing permafrost could 
release 20–40 PgC of CO2 in the period from 2100 to 2300 under a RCP2.6 scenario, and 115–172 PgC of 
CO2 under a RCP8.5 scenario. The multi-model ensemble in (McGuire et al., 2018) project a much wider 
range of permafrost soil carbon losses of 81–642 PgC (mean 314 PgC) for an RCP8.5 scenario from 2100 to 
2300, and of a gain of 14 PgC to a loss of 54 PgC (mean loss of 17 PgC) for an RCP4.5 scenario over the 
same period. </p>

<p>Methane release from permafrost thaw (including abrupt thaw) under high-warming RCP8.5 scenario has 
been estimated at 836–2614 Tg CH4 over the 21st century and 2800–7400 Tg CH4 from 2100–2300 
(Schneider von Deimling et al., 2015), and as 5300 Tg CH4 over the 21st century and 16000 Tg CH4 from 
2100–2300 (Turetsky et al., 2020). For RCP4.5, these numbers are 538–2356 Tg CH4 until 2100 and 2000-
6100 Tg CH4 from 2100–2300 (Schneider von Deimling et al., 2015), and 4100 Tg CH4 until 2100 and 
10000 Tg CH4 from 2100–2300 (Turetsky et al., 2020). </p>

<p>A key uncertainty is whether permafrost carbon feedbacks scale roughly linearly with warming (Koven et al., 2015c), or instead scale at a greater (MacDougall and Knutti, 2016b; McGuire et al., 2018) or smaller 
rate (e.g. CH4 emissions estimated by Turetsky et al., (2020a)). It also remains unclear whether the 
permafrost carbon pool represents a coherent global tipping element of the Earth system with a single abrupt 
threshold (Drijfhout et al., 2015) at a given level of global warming, or a local scale tipping point without 
abrupt thresholds when aggregated across the pan-Arctic region as is suggested by recent model results (e.g. 
(Koven et al., 2015b; McGuire et al., 2018)).  </p>

<p>In conclusion, thawing terrestrial permafrost will lead to carbon release under a warmer world (high 
confidence). However, there is low confidence on the timing, magnitude and linearity of the permafrost 
climate feedback owing to the wide range of published estimates and the incomplete knowledge and 
representation in models of drivers and relationships. It is projected that CO2 released from permafrost will 
be 18 (3.1–41) PgC per 1°C by 2100 with the relative contribution of CO2 vs CH4 remaining poorly 
constrained. Permafrost carbon feedbacks are included among the underrepresented feedbacks quantified in 
Figure 5.29. </p>
