<p>This box provides short descriptions of key concepts which are relevant to the AR6 WGI assessment, with a 
focus on their use in the Technical Summary and the Summary for Policymakers. The Glossary (Annex VII) 
includes  more  information  on  these  concepts  along  with  definitions  of  many  other  important  terms  and 
concepts used in this Report. </p>

<h2>Characteristics of Climate Change Assessment</h2>

<p><em>Global warming:</em> Global warming refers to the change of global surface temperature relative to a baseline 
depending upon the application. Specific global warming levels, such as 1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C or 4°C, are defined 
as changes in global surface temperature relative to the years 1850–1900 as the baseline (the earliest period of 
reliable  observations  with  sufficient  geographic  coverage).  They  are  used  to  assess  and  communicate 
information about global and regional changes, linking to scenarios and used as a common basis for WGII and 
WGIII assessments. (TS.1.3, Cross-Section Box TS.1) {1.4.1, 1.6.2, 4.6.1, Cross-Chapter Box 1.5, Cross-Chapter Box 2.3, Cross-Chapter Box 11.1, 
and Cross-Chapter Box 12.1, Atlas.3-Atlas.11, Glossary} </p>

<p><em>Emergence:</em>  Emergence  refers  to  the  experience  or  appearance  of  novel  conditions  of  a  particular  climate 
variable  in  a  given  region.  This concept is often expressed  as the  ratio  of  the  change in  a climate  variable 
relative  to  the  amplitude  of  natural  variations  of  that  variable  (often  termed  a  ‘signal-to-noise’  ratio,  with 
emergence occurring at a defined threshold of this ratio). Emergence can be expressed in terms of a time or a 
global warming level at which the novel conditions appear and can be estimated using observations or model 
simulations.  (TS.1.2.3,  TS.4.2)  {1.4.2,  FAQ 1.2,  7.5.5,  <goto>10.3</goto>,  <goto>10.4</goto>,  12.5.2,  Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1, 
Glossary} </p>

<p><em>Cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions:</em> The total net amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere as a 
result  of  human  activities.  Given  the  nearly  linear  relationship  between  cumulative  CO2  emissions  and 
increases in global surface temperature, cumulative CO2 emissions are relevant for understanding how past 
and future CO2 emissions affect global surface temperature. A related term  – remaining carbon budget – is 
used to describe the total net amount of CO2 that could be released in the future by human activities while 
keeping global warming to a specific global warming level, such as 1.5°C, taking into account the warming 
contribution from non-CO2 forcers as well. The remaining carbon budget is expressed from a recent specified 
date, while the total carbon budget is expressed starting from the pre-industrial period. (TS.1.3, TS.3.4) {1.6.3, 
5.5, Glossary} </p>

<p><em>Net zero CO2 emissions:</em> A condition that occurs when the amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere by 
human activities equals the amount of CO2 removed from the atmosphere by human activities over a specified 
period  of  time.  Net  negative  CO2  emissions  occur  when  anthropogenic  removals  exceed  anthropogenic 
emissions. (TS.3.3) {Box 1.4, Glossary}   </p>

<p><em>Earth’s energy imbalance:</em> In a stable climate, the amount of energy that the Earth receives from the Sun is 
approximately in balance with the amount of energy that is lost to space in the form of reflected sunlight and 
thermal radiation. ‘Climate drivers’, such as an increase in greenhouse gases or aerosols, interfere with this 
balance, causing the system to either gain or lose energy. The strength of a climate driver is quantified by its 
effective radiative forcing (ERF), measured in W m-2. Positive ERF leads to warming and negative ERF leads 
to  cooling.  That  warming  or  cooling  in  turn  can  change  the  energy  imbalance  through  many  positive 
(amplifying) or negative (dampening) climate feedbacks.  (TS.2.2, TS.3.1, TS.3.2) {2.2.8, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, Box 7.1, Box 7.2, Glossary} </p>

<p><em>Attribution:</em> Attribution is the process of evaluating the relative contributions of multiple causal factors to an 
observed change in climate variables (e.g., global surface temperature, global mean sea level change), or to 
the occurrence of extreme weather or climate-related events. Attributed causal factors include human activities 
(such as increases in greenhouse gas concentration and aerosols, or land-use change) or natural external drivers 
(solar and volcanic influences), and in some cases internal variability. (TS.1.2.4, TS.2, Box TS.10) {Cross-Working Group Box: Attribution, 3.5, 3.8, 10.4, 11.2.4, Glossary} </p>

<p><em>Committed change, long-term commitment:</em> Changes in the climate system, resulting from past, present and 
future  human  activities,  which  will  continue  long  into  the  future  (centuries  to  millennia)  even  with  strong 
reductions  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Some  aspects  of  the  climate  system,  including  the  terrestrial 
biosphere, deep ocean and the cryosphere, respond much more slowly than surface temperatures to changes in 
greenhouse gas concentrations. As a result, there are already substantial committed changes associated with 
past greenhouse gas emissions. For example, global mean sea level will continue to rise for thousands of years, 
even if future CO2 emissions are reduced to net zero and global warming halted, as excess energy due to past 
emissions continues to propagate into the deep ocean and as glaciers and ice sheets continue to melt. (TS.2.1, 
Box TS.4, Box TS.9) {1.2.1, 1.3, Box 1.2, Cross-Chapter Box 5.3} </p>

<h2>Climate Information for Regional Climate Change and Risk Assessment</h2>

<p><em>Distillation:</em> The process of synthesizing information about climate change from multiple lines of evidence 
obtained from a variety of sources, taking into account user context and values. It leads to an increase in the 
usability,  usefulness,  and  relevance  of  climate  information,  enhances  stakeholder  trust,  and  expands  the 
foundation  of  evidence  used  in  climate  services.  It  is  particularly  relevant  in  the  context  of  co-producing 
regional-scale climate information to support decision-making. (TS.4.1, Box TS.11) {10.1, 10.5, 12.6} </p>

<p><em>(Climate change) risk:</em>  The concept of risk is a key aspect of how the IPCC assesses and communicates to 
decision-makers about the potential for adverse consequences for human or ecological systems, recognising 
the diversity of values and objectives associated with such systems. In the context of climate change, risks can 
arise from potential impacts of climate change as well as human responses to climate change. WGI contributes 
to the common IPCC risk framing through the assessment of relevant climate information, including climatic 
impact-drivers and low-likelihood, high impact outcomes. (TS.1.4, TS.4.1, Box TS.4) {Cross-Chapter Boxes 
1.3 and 12.1, Glossary} </p>

<p><em>Climatic  impact-drivers:</em>  Physical  climate  system  conditions  (e.g.,  means,  events,  extremes)  that  can  be 
directly connected with having impacts on human or ecological systems are described as ‘climatic impact-
drivers’ (CIDs) without anticipating whether their impacts are detrimental (i.e., as for hazards in the context 
of  climate  change  risks)  or  provide  potential  opportunities.  A  range  of  indices  may  capture  the  sector-  or 
application-relevant  characteristics  of  a  climatic  impact-driver  and  can  reflect  exceedances  of  identified 
tolerance thresholds. (TS.1.4, TS.4.3) {12.1, 12.2, 12.3, FAQ12.1, Glossary} </p>

<p><em>Storylines:</em> The term storyline is used both in connection to scenarios (related to a future trajectory of emissions 
or socio-economic developments) or to describe plausible trajectories of weather and climate conditions or 
events, especially those related  to  high levels  of  risk.  Physical climate  storylines  are introduced  in  AR6 to 
explore uncertainties in climate change and natural climate variability, to develop and communicate integrated 
and context-relevant regional climate information, and to address issues with deep uncertainty5, including low-
likelihood, high-impact outcomes. (TS.1.4, Box TS.3, Infographic TS.1) {1.4.4, Box 10.2, Glossary} </p>

<p><em>Low-likelihood, high impact outcomes:</em> Events whose probability of occurrence is low or not well known (as 
in the context of deep uncertainty) but whose potential impacts on society and ecosystems could be high. To 
better inform risk assessment and decision-making, such low-likelihood outcomes are considered if they are 
associated with very large consequences and may therefore constitute material risks, even though those 
consequences do not necessarily represent the most likely outcome. (TS.1.4, Box TS.3, Figure TS.6) {1.4.4, 
4.8, Cross Chapter Box 1.3, Glossary} </p>
