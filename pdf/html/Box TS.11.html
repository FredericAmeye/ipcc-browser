<p>Climate  services  involve  providing  climate  information  to  assist  decision-making,  for  example,  about  how 
extreme rainfall will change to inform improvements in urban drainage. Since AR5, there has been a significant 
increase  in  the  range  and  diversity  of  climate  service  activities  (very  high  confidence).  The  level  of  user-
engagement, co-design and co-production are factors determining the utility of climate services, while resource 
limitations for these activities constrain their full potential. {12.6, Cross-Chapter Box 12.2} </p>

<p>Climate services include engagement from users and providers and an effective access mechanism; they are 
responsive to user needs and based on integrating scientifically credible information and relevant expertise. 
Climate services are being developed across regions, sectors, time scales and users-groups and include a range 
of  knowledge  brokerage  and  integration  activities.  These  involve  identifying  knowledge  needs;  compiling, 
translating  and  disseminating  knowledge;  coordinating  networks  and  building  capacity  through  informed 
decision-making; analysis, evaluation and development of policy; and personal consultation.  </p>

<p>Since AR5, climate change information produced in climate service contexts has increased significantly due 
to scientific and technological advancements and growing user awareness, requirements, and demand (very 
high confidence). Climate services are growing rapidly and are highly diverse in their practices and products. 
The  decision-making context, level of user  engagement  and  co-production  between scientists,  practitioners 
and intended users are important determinants of the type of climate service developed and their utility for 
supporting  adaptation,  mitigation  and  risk  management  decisions.  They  require  different  types  of  userâ€“
producer engagement depending on what the service aims to deliver (high confidence), and these fall into three 
broad categories: website-based services, interactive group activities and focused relationships.  </p>

<p>Realization of the full potential of climate services is often hindered by limited resources for the co-design and 
co-production process, including sustained engagement between scientists, service providers and users (high 
confidence).  Further  challenges  relate  to  the  development  and  provision  of  climate  services,  generation  of 
climate  service  products,  communication  with  users,  and  evaluation  of  their  quality  and  socio-economic 
benefit. {TS.4.1, 1.2.3, 10.5.4, 12.6, Cross-Chapter Box 12.2, Glossary} </p>
