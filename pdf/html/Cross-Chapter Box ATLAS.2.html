<p>Constructing regional climate information for Small Islands involves synthesis from multiple sources. This 
cross-chapter box presents information relevant to water resources, drawing on several chapters in AR6 and 
Section Atlas.10. It introduces the context and current evidence base followed by an assessment of trends 
and projections in rainfall, temperature and sea levels across Small Islands and highlight key findings. </p>

<h2>Regional context</h2>

<p>Small Islands are predominantly located in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and in the Caribbean 
(Nurse et al., 2014; Shultz et al., 2019). They are characterized by their small physical size, being surrounded 
by large ocean expanses, vulnerability to natural disasters and extreme events and relative isolation (Nurse et 
al., 2014) (Section 12.4.7, Section Atlas.10, Glossary). These and nearby larger islands (e.g., Madagascar, 
Cuba) are often water-scarce with low water volumes due to increasing demand (from population growth and 
tourism), aging and poorly designed infrastructure (Burns, 2002) and decreasing supply (from pollution, 
changes in precipitation patterns, drought, saltwater intrusion, regional sea level rise, inadequate water 
governance (Belmar et al., 2016; Mycoo, 2018) and competing and conflicting uses (Cashman, 2014; 
Gheuens et al., 2019) (Section 8.1.1.1). In the Caribbean, groundwater is the main freshwater source and 
depends strongly on rainfall variability (Post et al., 2018) while rain, ground or surface water are the primary 
sources for the Pacific islands depending on island type (volcanic or atoll), size and quality of groundwater 
reserves (Burns, 2002). Groundwater pumping and increasing sea levels also affect water availability by 
increasing the salinity of the aquifer (e.g., Bailey et al., 2015, 2016) thus reinforcing negative drought effects 
from reduced rainfall and increased evaporative demand from higher temperatures. For example, in 54% of 
the Marshall Islands, groundwater is highly vulnerable to droughts (Barkey and Bailey, 2017).  </p>

<h2>The climate of Small Islands and findings from previous IPCC assessments</h2>

<p>Intraseasonal to interannual rainfall in the Caribbean and in the Indian and Pacific Ocean is influenced by the 
trade winds, the passage of tropical cyclones (TCs), Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), easterly waves, 
migrations of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the North Atlantic Subtropical High (NASH) 
for the Caribbean, the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) and western North Pacific summer monsoon 
for the Pacific and the South Asian monsoons for the Indian Ocean. The relevant dominant modes of climate 
variability (Annex IV, Section 8.3.2.9) are El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean 
Dipole (IOD) which have been associated with extreme events in the islands (Stephenson et al., 2014; Kruk 
et al., 2015; Frazier et al., 2018)(Annex IV). The modes of climate variability are modulated by Pacific 
Decadal Variability (PDV), Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) and Atlantic Multidecadal Variability 
(AMV). These modes show no sustained trend since the late 19th century (high confidence) (Section 2.4).  </p>

<p>The AR5 WGI reports observed temperature increases of 0.1°C–0.2°C per decade in Pacific Islands with 
these trends very likely to continue under high emissions, and projects a drier rainy season for many islands 
in the southwest Pacific (Christensen et al., 2013). AR5 WGII reports rainfall reductions over the Caribbean, 
increases over the Seychelles, streamflow reductions over the Hawaiian Islands and salt-water intrusion into 
groundwater reserves in Pacific Islands resulting from storm surges and high tides (Nurse et al., 2014). 
SROCC (IPCC, 2019a) finds very high confidence that global mean sea level rise has accelerated in recent 
decades which has exacerbated extreme sea level events and flooding (high confidence). It will continue to 
rise with consequent increases in extreme levels so that the historical one-in-a-century extreme local sea 
level will become an annual event by the end of the century under all RCP scenarios (high confidence). In 
particular, many Small Islands are projected to experience historical centennial events at least annually by 
2050 under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions. The proportion of Category 4 and 5 TCs and associated 
precipitation rates along with their average intensity are projected to increase with a 2°C global temperature 
rise which will further increase the magnitude of resultant storm surges and flooding. The SROCC cross-
chapter box on Low-lying Islands and Coasts (Magnan et al., 2019) focused on sea level rise and oceanic 
changes and their impacts, therefore the assessment presented here on climate changes relevant to water 
resources, including precipitation and temperature, is complementary. </p>

<h2>Observations and attribution of changes</h2>

<p>Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.2: presents an overview of observed subregional trends relevant to water resources 
in some Small Islands and island regions largely from 1951. Some general observed climate trends include 
higher magnitude and frequency of temperatures including warm extremes (medium to high confidence; 
Table 11.7, Sections 12.4.7.1, Atlas.10.2), declines in high intensity rainfall events (low to medium 
confidence; Table 11.7), regional sea level rise with strong storm surge and waves resulting in increased 
coastal flood intensity (high confidence, Section 12.4.7.4, Section Atlas.10.2), and increased intensity and 
intensification rates of tropical cyclones at global scale (medium confidence, Sections 11.7.1.2, 12.4.7.3) and 
ocean acidification (virtually certain, Chapters 2, 6 and 9, Section Atlas.3.2).  </p>

<p>No significant long-term trends are observed for annual Caribbean rainfall over the 20th century (low 
confidence; Section Atlas.10.2). Over the western Pacific, generally decreasing but non-significant trends are 
noted in annual total rainfall from 1961 to 2011 (low confidence; Section Atlas.10.2; Table 11.5). June-July-
August (JJA) rainfall over the Caribbean shows some drying tendencies that may be linked to the combined 
effect of warm ENSO events and a positive NAO phase (Giannini et al., 2000; Méndez-Lázaro et al., 2014; 
Fernandes et al., 2015b), or to warm ENSO events and a positive PDV (Maldonado et al., 2016). The work 
of Herrera et al. (2018) however suggests that anthropogenic influences may also be possible though 
proposed mechanisms to date have not decoupled the influence of anthropogenic trends versus natural 
decadal variability (Vecchi et al., 2006; Vecchi and Soden, 2007; DiNezio et al., 2009). </p>

<p>Southern hemisphere subtropical Pacific June–November drying has been associated with intensification of 
the subtropical ridge and associated declines in baroclinicity (Whan et al., 2014). Austral summer drying in 
the southwest French Polynesia subregion has been linked with increased greenhouse-gas and ozone changes 
(Fyfe et al., 2012). The southern hemisphere jet stream has likely shifted polewards (Section 2.3.1.4.3) which 
is attributed largely to a trend in the Southern Annular Mode (Section 3.7.2).  </p>

<p>These assessments are constrained by limited availability of observational datasets and of scientific studies. <br />
Assessment of observed climate change for Small Islands is often constrained by low station density (Ryu 
and Hayhoe, 2014; Jones et al., 2016c), short periods of record, digitization requirements or data sharing 
limitations (Jones et al., 2016c), availability of metadata (McGree et al., 2014; Stephenson et al., 2014; Jones 
et al., 2016b), challenges in some gridded product representations of variability, for example for complex 
topography (Frazier and Giambelluca, 2017), and challenges characterizing the impact of vertical land 
motion on sea level rise (Wöppelmann and Marcos, 2016) (see also Section Atlas.10.2). </p>

<h2>Information on future climate changes</h2>

<p>Small Islands will very likely continue to warm this century, though at a rate less than the global average 
(Figure Atlas.28), with consequent increased frequency of warm extremes for the Caribbean and Western 
Pacific islands, and heatwave events for the Caribbean (high confidence) (Table 11.7). Annual and JJA 
rainfall declines are likely for some Indian and southern Pacific regions with drying over southern French 
Polynesia (attributed partially to greenhouse-gas increases) and farther east clearly evident in CMIP5 and 
CMIP6 projections (Figure Atlas.28) (high confidence). See also Section Atlas.10.4. </p>

<p>Rainfall is very likely to decline over the Caribbean, in the annual mean and especially in JJA, with a 
stronger and more coherent signal in CMIP6 compared to CMIP5 (Figure Atlas.28, Interactive Atlas) and 
reductions of 20–30% by the end of the century under high future emissions (SSP5-8.5). This JJA drying has 
been linked to a future strengthening of the Caribbean Low Level Jet (CLLJ) (Taylor et al., 2013b), a 
westward expansion and intensification of the NASH, stronger low-level easterlies over the region, a 
southwardly placed eastern Pacific ITCZ (Rauscher et al., 2008), and changing dynamics due to increased 
greenhouse-gas concentrations (Li et al., 2012b) (very high confidence). Projections from 15 GCM and two 
RCM experiments for 2080–2089 relative to 1970–1989 were for a generally drier Caribbean and a robust 
summer drying (Karmalkar et al., 2013). More recent downscaling studies (e.g., Taylor et al., 2018; Vichot-
Llano et al., 2021) also project a drier Caribbean and longer dry spells (Van Meerbeeck, 2020).  </p>

<p>Sea level rise is very likely to continue in all Small Island regions (Figure Atlas.28, see also Sections 9.6.3.3 
and 12.4.7.4) and its the effects will be compounded by TC surge events. In general, the most intense TCs 
are likely to intensify and produce more flood rains with warming, however detailed effects of climate 
change on TCs will vary by region (Knutson et al., 2019)(Section 11.7.1). Bailey et al. (2016) projected a 
20% decline in groundwater availability by 2050 in Coral Atoll islands of the Federal States of Micronesia 
and stressed that under higher sea level rise the decrease could be higher than 50% due to marine water 
intrusion into aquifers, as well as drought events. </p>

<h2>Summary of information distilled from multiple lines of evidence</h2>

<p>It is very likely that most Small Islands have warmed over the period of instrumental records. The clearest 
precipitation trend is a likely decrease in JJA rainfall over the Caribbean since 1950. There is limited 
evidence and low agreement for the cause of the observed drying trend, whether it is mainly caused by 
decadal-scale internal variability or anthropogenic forcing, but it is likely that it will continue over coming 
decades. It is likely that drying has occurred since the mid-20th century in some parts of the Pacific poleward 
of 20° latitude in both the northern and southern hemispheres and that these will continue over coming 
decades. Rainfall trends in most other Pacific and Indian Ocean Small Islands are mixed and largely non-
significant. It is very likely that sea levels will continue to rise in all Small Island regions and this will result 
in increased coastal flooding with the potential to increase salt-water intrusion into aquifers in Small Islands. </p>

<p>Whilst this assessment demonstrates that the climate of Small Islands has and will continue to change in 
diverse ways, constructing climate information for Small Islands is challenging. This is due to observational 
issues, incomplete understanding of some modes of variability and their representation by climate models 
and the lack of availability of large ensembles of regional climate model simulations and limited studies to 
decouple internal variability and anthropogenic influences. </p>
