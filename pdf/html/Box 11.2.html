<p>SREX (Chapter 3) assigned low confidence to low-probability high-impact (LLHI) events. Such events are 
often not anticipated and thus sometimes referred to as surprises. There are several types of LLHI events. 
Abrupt changes in mean climate are addressed in Chapter 4. Unanticipated LLHI events can either result 
from tipping points in the climate system (Section 1.4.4.3), such as the shutdown of the Atlantic 
thermohaline circulation (SROCC Ch6; Collins et al., 2019) or the drydown of the Amazonian rainforest 
(SR15 Ch3; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; Drijfhout et al. 2015), or from uncertainties in climate processes 
including climate feedbacks that may enhance or damp extremes either related to global or regional climate 
responses (Seneviratne et al., 2018b; Sutton, 2018). The low confidence does not by itself exclude the 
possibility of such events to occur, it is instead an indication of a poor state of knowledge. Such outcomes, 
while unlikely, could be associated with very high impacts, and are thus highly relevant from a risk 
perspective (see Chapter 1, Section 1.4.3, Box 11.4; Sutton, 2018, 2019). Alternatively, high impacts can 
occur when different extremes occur at the same time or in short succession at the same location or in several 
regions with shared vulnerability (e.g. food-basket regions Gaupp et al., 2019). These “compound events” 
are assessed in Section 11.8 and Box 11.4 provides a case-study example.  </p>

<p>The difficulties in determining the likelihood of occurrence and time frame of potential tipping points and 
LLHI events persist. However, new literature has emerged on unanticipated and low-probability high-impact 
events more generally. There are events that are sufficiently rare that they have not been observed in 
meteorological records, but whose occurrence is nonetheless plausible within the current state of the climate 
system, see examples below and McCollum et al. (2020). The rare nature of such events and the limited 
availability of relevant data makes it difficult to estimate their occurrence probability and thus gives little 
evidence on whether to include such hypothetical events in planning decisions and risk assessments. The 
estimation of such potential surprises is often limited to events that have historical analogues (including 
before the instrumental records began, Wetter et al., 2014), albeit the magnitude of the event may differ. 
Additionally, there is also a limitation of available resources to exhaust all plausible trajectories of the 
climate system. As a result, there will still be events that cannot be anticipated. These events can be surprises 
to many in that the events have not been experienced, although their occurrence could be inferred by 
statistical means or physical modelling approaches (Chen et al., 2017; van Oldenborgh et al., 2017; 
Harrington and Otto, 2018a). Another approach focusing on the estimation of low-probability events and of 
events whose likelihood of occurrence is unknown consists in using physical climate models to create a 
physically self-consistent storyline of plausible extreme events and assessing their impacts and driving 
factors in past (Section 11.2.3) or future conditions (11.2.4) (Cheng et al., 2018; Schaller et al., 2020; 
Shepherd, 2016; Shepherd et al., 2018; Sutton, 2018; Zappa and Shepherd, 2017; Wehrli et al., 2020; <br />
Hazeleger et al., 2015).  </p>

<p>In many parts of the world, observational data are limited to 50-60 years. This means that the chance to 
observe an extreme event that occurs once in several hundred or more years is small. Thus, when a very 
extreme event occurs, it becomes a surprise to many (Bao et al., 2017; McCollum et al., 2020), and very rare 
events are often associated with high impacts (van Oldenborgh et al., 2017; Philip et al., 2018b; Tozer et al., 
2020). Attributing and projecting very rare events in a particular location by assessing their likelihood of 
occurrence within the same larger region and climate thus provides another way to make quantitative 
assessments regarding events that are extremely rare locally. Some examples of such events include for 
instance:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Hurricane Harvey, that made landfall in Houston, TX in August 2017 (Section 11.7.1.4.) </li>
<li>The 2010-2011 extreme floods in Queensland, Australia (Christidis et al., 2013a) </li>
<li>The 2018 concurrent heat waves across the northern Hemisphere (Box 11.4) </li>
<li>Tropical cyclone Idai in Mozambique (Cross-Chapter Box Disaster in WGII AR6 Chapter 4) </li>
<li>The California fires in 2018 and 2019 </li>
<li>The 2019-2020 Australia fires (Cross-Chapter Box Disaster in WGII AR6 Chapter 4) </li>
</ul>

<p>One factor making such events hard to anticipate is the fact that we now live in a non-stationary climate, and 
that the framework of reference for adaptation is continuously moving. As an example, the concurrent heat 
waves that occurred across the Northern Hemisphere in the summer of 2018 were considered very unusual 
and were indeed unprecedented given the total area that was concurrently affected (Toreti et al., 2019; Vogel 
et al., 2019; Drouard et al., 2019; Kornhuber et al., 2019); however, the probability of this event under 1°C 
global warming was found to be about 16% (Vogel et al., 2019), which is not particularly low. Similarly, the 
2013 summer temperature over eastern China was the hottest on record at the time, but it had an estimated 
recurrence interval of about 4 years in the climate of 2013 (Sun et al., 2014). Furthermore, when other 
aspects of the risk, vulnerability, and exposure are historically high or have recently increased (see WGII, 
Chapter 16, Section 16.4), relatively moderate extremes can have very high impacts (Otto et al., 2015b; 
Philip et al., 2018b). As warming continues, the climate moves further away from its historical state with 
which we are familiar, resulting in an increased likelihood of unprecedented events and surprises. This is 
particularly the case under high global warming levels e.g. such as the climate of the late 21st century under 
high-emissions scenarios (above 4°C of global warming, CC-Box 11.1). </p>

<p>Another factor highlighted in Section 11.8 and Box 11.4 making events high-impact and difficult to 
anticipate is that several locations under moderate warming levels could be affected simultaneously, or very 
repeatedly by different types of extremes (Mora et al., 2018, Gaupp et al., 2019; Vogel et al., 2019). Box 
11.4 shows that concurrent events at different locations, which can lead to major impacts across the world, 
can also result from the combination of anomalous circulation or natural variability (ENSO) patterns with 
amplification of resulting responses to human-induced global warming. Also multivariate extremes at single 
locations pose specific challenges to anticipation (Section 11.8), with low-likelihoods in the current climate 
but the probability of occurrence of such compound events strongly increasing with increasing global 
warming levels (Vogel et al., 2020a). Therefore, in order to estimate whether and at what level of global 
warming very high impacts arising from extremes would occur, the spatial extent of extremes and the 
potential of compounding extremes need to be assessed. Sections 11.3, 11.4, 11.7 and 11.8 highlight 
increasing evidence that temperature extremes, higher intensity precipitation accompanying tropical 
cyclones, and compound events such as dry/hot conditions conducive to wildfire or storm surges resulting 
from sea level rise and heavy precipitation events, pose widespread threats to societies already at relatively 
low warming levels. Studies have already shown that the probability for some recent extreme events is so 
small in the undisturbed world such that these events may not have been possible without human influence 
(Section 11.2.4). Box 11.2, Table 1, provides examples of projected changes in LLHI extremes (single 
extremes, compound events) of potential relevance for impact and adaptation assessments showing that 
today’s very rare events can become commonplace in a warmer future. </p>

<p>In summary, the future occurrence of LLHI events linked to climate extremes is generally associated with 
low confidence, but cannot be excluded, especially at global warming levels above 4°C. Compound events, 
including concurrent extremes, are a factor increasing the probability of LLHI events (high confidence). 
With increasing global warming some compound events with low likelihood in past and current climate 
will become more frequent, and there is a higher chance of historically unprecedented events and 
surprises (high confidence). However, even extreme events that do not have a particularly low probability 
in the present climate (at more than 1°C of global warming) can be perceived as surprises because of the 
pace of global warming (high confidence). </p>
