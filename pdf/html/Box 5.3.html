<p>During the industrial era, CO2 emitted by the combustion of fossil fuels and land-use change has been 
redistributed between atmosphere, land, and ocean carbon reservoirs due to carbon cycle processes (Box 5.3 
Figure 1b; Figure 5.13). Over the past decade (2010â€“2019), 46% of the emitted CO2 remained in the 
atmosphere, 23% was taken up by the ocean and 31% by the terrestrial biosphere (Section 5.2.1.5). When 
carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is applied during periods in which human activities are net CO2 sources to 
the atmosphere and the amount of emissions removed by CDR is smaller than the net source (net positive 
CO2 emissions), CDR acts to reduce the net emissions (Box 5.3 Figure 1c). In this scenario part of the CO2 
emissions into the atmosphere is removed by the land and ocean sinks, as has been the case historically. </p>

<p>When CDR removes more CO2 emissions than human activities emit (net negative CO2 emissions), and 
atmospheric CO2 declines, the land and ocean sinks initially continue to take up CO2 from the atmosphere. 
This because carbon sinks, particularly the ocean, exhibit inertia and continue to respond to the prior 
trajectory of rising atmospheric CO2 concentration. After some time, which is determined by the magnitude 
of the removal and the rate and amount of CO2 emissions prior to the CDR application, land and ocean 
carbon reservoirs begin to release CO2 to the atmosphere making CDR less effective (Box 5.3 Figure 1d).  </p>
