<p>Global mean sea level (GMSL) increased by 0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m over the period 1901 to 2018 with a rate 
of rise that has accelerated since the 1960s to 3.7 [3.2 to 4.2] mm yr-1 for the period 2006–2018 (high 
confidence). Human activity was very likely the main driver of observed GMSL rise since 1970, and new 
observational evidence leads to an assessed sea level rise over the period 1901 to 2018 that is consistent with 
the sum of individual components contributing to sea level rise, including expansion due to ocean warming 
and melting of glaciers and ice sheets (high confidence). It is virtually certain that GMSL will continue to 
rise over the 21st century in response to continued warming of the climate system (Box TS.4, Figure 1). Sea 
level responds to GHG emissions more slowly than global surface temperature, leading to weaker scenario 
dependence over the 21st century than for global surface temperature (high confidence). This slow response 
also leads to long-term committed sea level rise, associated with ongoing ocean heat uptake and the slow 
adjustment of the ice sheets, that will continue over the centuries and millennia following cessation of 
emissions (high confidence). By 2100, GMSL is projected to rise by 0.28–0.55 m (likely range) under SSP1-
1.9 and 0.63–1.02 m (likely range) under SSP5-8.5 relative to the 1995–2014 average (medium confidence). 
Under the higher CO2 emissions scenarios, there is deep uncertainty in sea level projections for 2100 and 
beyond associated with the ice-sheet responses to warming. In a low-likelihood, high-impact storyline and a 
high CO2 emissions scenario, ice-sheet processes characterized by deep uncertainty could drive GMSL rise 
up to about 5 m by 2150. Given the long-term commitment, uncertainty in the timing of reaching different 
GMSL rise levels is an important consideration for adaptation planning. {2.3, 3.4, 3.5, 9.6, Box 9.4, Box 
TS.9 Cross-Chapter Box 9.1, Table 9.5} </p>

<p>GMSL change is driven by warming or cooling of the ocean (and the associated expansion/contraction) and 
changes in the amount of ice and water stored on land. Paleo-evidence shows that GMSL has been about 70 
m higher and 130 m lower than present within the past 55 million years and was likely 5 to 10 m higher 
during the Last Interglacial (Box TS.2, Figure 1). Sea level observations show that GMSL rose by 0.20 [0.15 
to 0.25] m over the period 1901–2018 at an average rate of 1.7 [1.3 to 2.2] mm yr-1. New analyses and paleo-
evidence since the AR5 show this rate is very likely faster than during any century over at least the last three 
millennia (high confidence). Since the AR5, there is strengthened evidence for an increase in the rate of 
GMSL rise since the mid-20th century, with an average rate of 2.3 [1.6–3.1] mm yr-1 over the period 1971–
2018 increasing to 3.7 [3.2–4.2] mm yr-1 for the period 2006–2018 (high confidence). {2.3.3.3, 9.6.1, 9.6.2} </p>

<p>GMSL will continue to rise throughout the 21st century (Box TS.4, Figure 1a). Considering only those 
processes in whose projections we have at least medium confidence, relative to the period 1995–2014, 
GMSL is projected to rise between 0.18 m (0.15–0.23 m, likely range) (SSP1-1.9) and 0.23 m (0.20–0.30 m, 
likely range) (SSP5-8.5) by 2050. By 2100, the projected rise is between 0.38 m (0.28–0.55 m, likely range) 
(SSP1-1.9) and 0.77 m (0.63–1.02 m, likely range) (SSP5-8.5) (Table 9.9). The methods, models and 
scenarios used for sea level projections in the AR6 are updated from those employed by the SROCC, with 
contributions informed by the latest model projections described in the ocean and cryosphere sections 
(TS.2.4 and TS.2.5). Despite these differences, the sea level projections are broadly consistent with those of 
the SROCC. {4.3.2, 9.6.3} </p>

<p>Importantly, likely range projections do not include those ice-sheet-related processes whose quantification is 
highly uncertain or that are characterized by deep uncertainty. Higher amounts of GMSL rise before 2100 
could be caused by earlier-than-projected disintegration of marine ice shelves, the abrupt, widespread onset 
of Marine Ice Sheet Instability (MISI) and Marine Ice Cliff Instability (MICI) around Antarctica, and faster-
than-projected changes in the surface mass balance and dynamical ice loss from Greenland (Box TS.4, 
Figure 1). In a low-likelihood, high-impact storyline and a high CO2 emissions scenario, such processes 
could in combination contribute more than one additional meter of sea level rise by 2100. {Box TS.3, 4.3.2, 
9.6.3, Box 9.4}  </p>

<p>Beyond 2100, GMSL will continue to rise for centuries to millennia due to continuing deep ocean heat 
uptake and mass loss from ice sheets, and will remain elevated for thousands of years (high confidence). By 
2150, considering only those processes in whose projections we have at least medium confidence and 
assuming no acceleration in ice-mass flux after 2100, GMSL is projected to rise between 0.6 m (0.4–0.9 m, 
likely range) (SSP1-1.9) and 1.4 m (1.0–1.9 m, likely range) (SSP5-8.5), relative to the period 1995–2014 
based on the SSP scenario extensions. Under high CO2 emissions, processes in which there is low 
confidence, such as Marine Ice Cliff Instability (MICI), could drive GMSL rise up to about 5 m by 2150 
(Box TS.4, Figure 1a). By 2300, GMSL will rise 0.3–3.1 m under low CO2 emissions (SSP1-2.6) (low 
confidence). Under high CO2 emissions (SSP5-8.5), projected GMSL rise is between 1.7 and 6.8 m by 2300 
in the absence of MICI and by up to 16 m considering MICI (low confidence). Over 2000 years, there is 
medium agreement and limited evidence that committed GMSL rise is projected to be about 2–3 m with 
1.5°C peak warming, 2–6 m with 2°C of peak warming, 4–10 m with 3°C of peak warming, 12–16 m with 
4°C of peak warming, and 19–22 m with 5°C of peak warming. {TS.1.3.1, 9.6.3} </p>

<p>Looking at uncertainty in time provides an alternative perspective on uncertainty in future sea-level rise (Box 
TS.4, Figure 1c). For example, considering only medium confidence processes, GMSL rise is likely to 
exceed 0.5 m between about 2080 and 2170 under SSP1-2.6 and between about 2070 and 2090 under SSP5- 
8.5. Given the long-term commitment, uncertainty in the timing of reaching different levels of GMSL rise is 
an important consideration for adaptation planning. {9.6.3}  </p>

<p>At regional scales, additional processes come into play that modify the local sea level change relative to 
GMSL, including vertical land motion; ocean circulation and density changes and gravitational, rotational, 
and deformational effects arising from the redistribution of water and ice mass between land and the ocean. 
These processes give rise to a spatial pattern that tends to increase sea level rise at the low latitudes and 
reduce sea-level rise at high latitudes. However, over the 21st century, the majority of coastal locations have 
a median projected regional sea level rise within ± 20% of the projected GMSL change (medium 
confidence). Further details on regional sea level change and extremes are provided in TS.4. {9.6.3} </p>
