<p>Climate services involve the provision of climate information in such a way as to assist decision-making. 
The service needs to have appropriate engagement from users and providers, be based on scientifically 
credible information and expertise, have an effective access mechanism, and meet the users’ needs (Hewitt et 
al., 2012). Predominantly, climate services are targeted at informing and enabling risk management in 
adaptation to climate variability and change (Jones et al., 2014; Vaughan et al., 2018). Chapter 1 introduces 
climate services in a broader context of interaction between science and society, including how climate 
information can be tailored and co-produced for greatest utility in specific contexts. Chapter 10 assesses the 
key foundations for the generation of climate information about regional climate change. Chapters 11, 12 
and Atlas comprehensively assess regional climate change information. The Interactive Atlas gives access to 
various repositories of quantitative climate information. In WG2, Chapter 17 assesses climate services in the 
context of climate risk management.  </p>

<p>Climate services contexts are diverse and complex. They can be characterised using different factors such as 
sectors, regions, purposes, time horizons, data sources, level of processing of climate data, background 
knowledge, type of climate services providers, as well as the nature of the interactions between providers, 
users and other stakeholders (Bessembinder et al., 2019). To illustrate the wide diversity of climate change 
information in climate services, a useful categorisation is by user-provider engagement of climate services 
(Cross-Chapter Box 12.2, Figure 1). One broad category includes Websites and web tools which generally 
focuses on data and information provision (Hewitson et al., 2017). Websites are generally able to reach many 
users, but engagement is passive through one-way transfer of information. The second broad category 
involves Interactive group activities, such as workshops, meetings and interactive forums, which create a 
stronger dialogue between climate service providers and decision-makers. Multi-way communication and 
regular interaction enable building of trust, co-learning and co-production of products and services. The third 
broad category involves Focused relationships which are tailored, targeted and address very specific needs 
of the user. Effective engagement arises from an iterative process between the provider and user to ensure 
the user’s needs are being addressed appropriately (Hewitt et al., 2017b).  </p>

<p>The diversity of climate services practices and products is illustrated here using three case studies that 
represent each of the broad categories of provider-user engagement (Cross-chapter box Figure 1). </p>

<p><figref>Cross-Chapter Box 12.2,Figure1</figref></p>

<h2>Case study 1 – Websites and web tools.</h2>

<p>The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) provides free and 
open access to climate data, tools and information through a website. It also includes demonstration projects 
that show how C3S data can be used in practice through case studies, training sessions and workshops 
(Thepaut et al., 2018). A large audience of the service is composed of intermediate users, loosely defined as 
the community of operators in one of the intermediate steps between the primary producers of climate data 
and the ultimate beneficiaries. </p>

<p>To address this audience, the strategy of C3S is to provide free and open access climate data and tools such 
as historical observations (both satellite and ground-based), climate data records relevant for a number of 
Essential Climate Variables (Bojinski et al., 2014), global and regional reanalyses, climate monitoring 
bulletins, seasonal predictions, as well as both global (a selection of simulations from the Coupled Model 
Intercomparison Project (CMIP (Taylor et al., 2012; Eyring et al., 2016)) and regional climate projections 
from the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (Euro- and Med-CORDEX (Jacob et al., 2014; 
Ruti et al., 2016)). A number of indices for various sectors can be calculated through cloud-based tools. For 
instance, in order to address the specific needs of key sectoral users, climate impact indicators for common 
variables such as “heating degree-days” can be calculated by the users and made available to others 
(Buontempo et al., 2020). All this material is quality controlled following a standardised, transparent and 
traceable framework. </p>

<p>C3S also facilitates the tailoring process, by providing a series of working open-source on-the-cloud 
demonstrators which show how climate data can be transformed into actionable information to meet specific 
user requirements. This tailoring process covers the chain between the definition of key indicators all the 
way to the user interface. The C3S products definition and production involve scientists that produced and 
assessed the data. A variety of potential users are involved in the definition of indicators and other products.  </p>

<p>Through its quality assurance process and demonstrators, C3S provides a basic evaluation of all climate data 
it provides access, and it encourages the users to develop their own case-specific analysis within the C3S 
infrastructure. Trustworthiness and relevance of such an analysis are substantially strengthened through a 
distillation process, co-designed by the user and data provider, and drawing upon multiple lines of evidence 
and process-based evaluation of model fitness (Section 10.5).   </p>

<h2>Case study 2 – Interactive group activities.</h2>

<p>Science-application engagement is extremely challenging 
especially in critically important but complex contexts such as rapidly growing cities in developing nations 
(Culwick and Patel, 2017). The publicly funded Future Resilience for African CiTies And Lands 
(FRACTAL) project was conceived and designed in response to extensive and strong evidence and 
experience that useful and useable climate services require strong mutual relationships across the science-
application interface that can be built using supportive processes and structures (Taylor et al., 2017).   </p>

<p>Informed by this understanding, FRACTAL was grounded in a very reflexive and context guided approach 
with city decision making at its core (Taylor et al., 2017a). Representatives from selected southern African 
cities were included in the proposal design and, throughout the project, a core principle was to allow the city 
partners to lead and guide the process.  </p>

<p>Two important elements were deployed in FRACTAL: “embedded researchers” and “learning labs”. 
Embedded Researchers were seconded into the municipality and served as the essential connection for the 
learning process within each city (Steynor et al., 2020). Learning Labs (Arrighi et al., 2016) were interactive 
structures in which participants from academia, local city government and councils, state-owned enterprises, 
communities and community development institutions, etc could interact. Embedded Researchers and 
Learning Labs were the backbone of ongoing learning processes within each city and resulted in more 
focused small-group dialogues, capacity development and training processes, and within-city research and 
engagement activities. Each Learning Lab focused initially on identifying “burning issues” without a 
requirement that they involve strong climate linkages. However, with the over-arching focus on resilience, 
discussions evolved in that direction and the burning issues identified often centered around water in peri-
urban areas e.g., in Windhoek (Scott et al., 2018).  </p>

<p>The learning labs also introduced and developed the concept of Climate Risk Narratives as a process and 
product (CRN; see Cross-Chapter Box 12.2, Figure 2 and Chapter 10 Box 10.2 on storylines) to generate and 
integrate climate and socio-economic information relevant to adaptation and resilience (Jack et al., 2020). 
The first CRNs were informed primarily by climate evidence, but also included some tentative socio-
economic impact elements gleaned from literature and other studies. Their content was intentionally 
provocative and designed to promote debate and discussion, and subsequent iteration. Many participants 
noted that this was the first time that various important conversations across governance structures and 
disciplinary areas had occurred around what climate change may actually mean. This demonstrates the 
engagement value of CRNs as a key element in an iterative co-production process to ensure important details 
are included correctly, such as the local context, terms and names as well as providing reality checks on the 
impacts and societal responses (Jack et al., 2020). </p>

<p>This case study emphasises the positive contributions of the fit, tailoring and contextualization of climate 
information with respect to the specific decision-making needs of particular users (10.5 and WG2 
17.4.4.2.2), the importance of participatory planning for risk management in urban areas (WG2 6.1.5 and 
6.4.2) and the importance of networks and organizations which link researchers, policy-makers and end-
users to promote adaptation in African cities (WG2 9.8.5.1). Upscaling this type of interactive activity to 
cater for the large number of user demands remains a challenge.  </p>

<h2>Case study 3 – Focused relationships.</h2>

<p>This broad category involves one-to-one engagement between a 
provider and a user with very specific needs. One such user is the Asian Development Bank (ADB) who has 
committed to making all its investments climate resilient by implementing a climate risk management 
framework (ADB, 2014, 2018; Lu, 2019).  The climate risk management framework mandates all climate-
sensitive investment projects undertake a climate risk and adaptation assessment, to identify material risks of 
a changing climate to the proposed project and potential adaptive measures to be incorporated into project 
design, implementation, maintenance and/or monitoring.  Typically, loan project processing teams procure 
consulting services for a bespoke climate risk and adaptation assessment (CRA) for a specific project.  The 
user-provider engagement is highly targeted and goal-oriented. An example of such a focused user-provider 
engagement is the CRA carried out as part of an investment project in Viet Nam, the Water Efficiency 
Improvement in Drought-Affected Provinces (WEIDAP) project.    </p>

<p>In the wake of the El Niño-induced 2015-2016 severe drought causing major damage to agricultural land in 
the Central Highlands of Viet Nam, the WEIDAP project was initiated to improve water productivity of 
irrigated agriculture.  Proposed project interventions include a package of both “soft” (e.g., policy, 
institutional and capacity building, on-farm water efficiency practices) and “hard” (modernized irrigation 
schemes) activities.  To ensure that the project delivers expected benefits under a changing climate, 
consultants were recruited to carry out a detailed CRA, working as part of the overall project processing 
team.  Through extensive consultations with the rest of the project team and review of literature including 
relevant climate projections, the CRA consultants chose to construct three broad climate scenarios for the 
2050s (a time frame appropriate for the lifetime of the irrigation schemes being proposed under the project): 
a warm-and-wet, a hot-and-wet, and a hotter future. Outputs from a selection of CMIP5 models were 
analysed under these three scenarios, to derive changes in temperature, rainfall and potential 
evapotranspiration, which in turn were used as inputs to hydrological, crop and agro-economics models to 
assess the impacts of climate change on the overall project performance. Table 1 presents the summary of the 
key parameters under the three scenarios. Recommendations from the CRA included (largely minor) 
refinements and additional activities for drought planning, detailed engineering design of the relevant project 
components (such as access roads, river crossings and foundations), and support for poorer farmers who may 
not be able to afford access to water and climate-resilient technologies. </p>

<p>This case study illustrates that climate information distillation including a sustained iterative engagement 
between climate information users, producers and translators can improve the quality of the information and 
the decision-making (Section 10.5, WG2 17.4.4.2.2).   </p>
