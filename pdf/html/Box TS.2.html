<p>Paleoclimate evidence is integrated within multiple lines of evidence across the WGI report to more fully 
understand the climate system. Paleo evidence extends instrument-based observations of climate variables 
and climate drivers back in time, providing the long-term context needed to gauge the extent to which recent 
and potential future changes are unusual (TS.2, Figure TS.1). Pre-industrial climate states complement 
evidence from climate model projections by providing real-world examples of climate characteristics for past 
global warming levels, with empirical evidence for how the slow-responding components of the climate 
system operate over centuries to millennia – the time scale for committed climate change (Core Concepts 
Box, Box TS.4, Box TS.9). Information about the state of the climate system during well-described 
paleoclimate reference periods helps narrow the uncertainty range in the overall assessment of Earth’s 
sensitivity to climate forcing (TS.3.2.1). {Cross-Chapter Box 2.1, FAQ 1.3, FAQ 2.1} </p>

<p><em>Paleoclimate reference periods.</em> Over the long evolution of the Earth’s climate, several periods have 
received extensive research attention as examples of distinct climate states and rapid climate transitions (Box 
TS.2, Figure 1). These paleoclimate reference periods represent the present geological era (Cenozoic; past 65 
million years) and are used across chapters to help structure the assessment of climate changes prior to 
industrialization. Cross-Chapter Box 2.1 describes the reference periods, along with a brief account of their 
climate forcings, and lists where each is discussed in other chapters. Cross-Chapter Box 2.4 summarizes 
information on one of the reference periods, the mid-Pliocene Warm Period. The Interactive Atlas includes 
model output from the World Climate Research Programme Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 
(CMIP6) for four of the paleoclimate reference periods. </p>

<p><em>Paleoclimate models and reconstructions.</em> Climate models that target paleoclimate reference periods have 
been featured by the IPCC since the First Assessment Report. Under the framework of CMIP6-PMIP4 
(Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project), new protocols for model intercomparisons have been 
developed for multiple paleoclimate reference periods. These modelling efforts have led to improved 
understanding of the climate response to different external forcings, including changes in Earth’s orbital and 
plate movements, solar irradiance, volcanism, ice-sheet size, and atmospheric greenhouse gases. Likewise, 
quantitative reconstructions of climate variables from proxy records that are compared with paleoclimate 
simulations have improved as the number of study sites and variety of proxy types have expanded, and as 
records have been compiled into new regional and global datasets. {1.3.2, 1.5.1, Cross-Chapter Box 2.1, Cross-Chapter Box 2.4} </p>

<p><em>Global surface temperature.</em> Since AR5, updated climate forcings, improved models, new understanding of 
the strengths and weaknesses of a growing array of proxy records, better chronologies, and more robust 
proxy data products have led to better agreement between models and reconstructions. For global surface 
temperature, the mid-point of the AR6-assessed range and the median of the model-simulated temperatures 
differ by an average of 0.5°C across five reference periods; they overlap within their 90% ranges in four of 
five cases, which together span from about 6°C [5–7]°C colder during the Last Glacial Maximum to about 
14 [10 to 18] °C warmer during the Early Eocene, relative to 1850–1900 (Box TS.2, Figure 2a). Changes in 
temperature by latitude in response to multiple forcings show that polar amplification (stronger warming at 
high latitudes than the global average) is a prominent feature of the climate system across multiple climate 
states, and the ability of models to simulate this polar amplification in past warm climates has improved 
since AR5 (high confidence). Over the past millennium, and especially since about 1300 CE, simulated 
global surface temperature anomalies are well within the uncertainty of reconstructions (medium 
confidence), except for some short periods immediately following large volcanic eruptions, for which 
different forcing datasets disagree (Box TS.2, Figure 2b). {2.3.1.1, 3.3.3.1, 3.8.2.1, 7.4.4.1.2} </p>

<p><em>Equilibrium climate sensitivity.</em> Paleoclimate data provide evidence to estimate equilibrium climate 
sensitivity (ECS12) (TS.3.2.1). In AR6, refinements in paleo data for paleoclimate reference periods indicate 
that ECS is very likely greater than 1.5°C and likely less than 4.5°C, which is largely consistent with other 
lines of evidence and helps narrow the uncertainty range of the overall assessment of ECS. Some of the 
CMIP6 climate models that have either high (> 5°C) or low (&lt; 2°C) ECS also simulate past global surface 
temperature changes outside the range of proxy-based reconstructions for the coldest and warmest reference 
periods. Since AR5, independent lines of evidence, including proxy records from past warm periods and 
glacial-interglacial cycles, indicate that sensitivity to forcing increases as temperature increases (TS.3.2.2). 
{7.4.3.2, 7.5.3, 7.5.6, Table 7.11} </p>

<p><em>Water cycle.</em> New hydroclimate reconstructions and model-data comparisons have improved the 
understanding of the causes and effects of long-term changes in atmospheric and ocean circulation, including 
monsoon variability and modes of variability (Box TS.13, TS.4.2). Climate models are able to reproduce 
decadal drought variability on large regional scales, including the severity, persistence and spatial extent of 
past megadroughts known from proxy records (medium confidence). Some long-standing discrepancies 
remain, however, such as the magnitude of African monsoon precipitation during the early Holocene, 
suggesting continuing knowledge gaps. Paleoclimate evidence shows that, in relatively high CO2 climates 
such as the Pliocene, Walker circulation over the equatorial Pacific Ocean weakens, supporting the high 
confidence model projections of weakened Walker cells by the end of the 21st century. {3.3.2, 8.3.1.6, 
8.4.1.6, 8.5.2.1, 9.2} </p>

<p><em>Sea level and ice sheets.</em> Although past and future global warming differ in their forcings, evidence from 
paleoclimate records and modelling show that ice sheet mass and global mean sea level (GMSL) responded 
dynamically over multiple millennia (high confidence). This evidence helps to constrain estimates of the 
committed GMSL response to global warming (Box TS.4). For example, under a past global warming levels 
of around 2.5°C–4°C relative to 1850–1900, like during the mid-Pliocene Warm Period, sea level was 5–25 
m higher than 1900 (medium confidence); under past global warming levels of 10°C–18°C, like during the 
Early Eocene, the planet was essentially ice free (high confidence). Constraints from these past warm 
periods, combined with physical understanding, glaciology and modelling, indicate a committed long-
term GMSL rise over 10,000 years, reaching about 8–13 m for sustained peak global warming of 2°C and to 
28–37 m for 5°C, which exceeds the AR5 estimate. {2.3.3.3, 9.4.1.4, 9.4.2.6, 9.6.2, 9.6.3.5} </p>

<p><em>Ocean.</em> Since AR5, better integration of paleo-oceanographic data with modelling along with higher-
resolution analyses of transient changes have improved understanding of long-term ocean processes. Low-
latitude sea-surface temperatures at the Last Glacial Maximum cooled more than previously inferred, 
resolving some inconsistencies noted in AR5. This paleo context supports the assessment that ongoing 
increase in ocean heat content (OHC) represents a long-term commitment (see Core Concepts Box), 
essentially irreversible on human time scales (high confidence). Estimates of past global OHC variations 
generally track those of sea surface temperatures around Antarctica, underscoring the importance of 
Southern Ocean processes in regulating deep-ocean temperatures. Paleoclimate data, along with other 
evidence of glacial-interglacial changes, show that Antarctic Circumpolar flow strengthened and that 
ventilation of Antarctic Bottom Water accelerated during warming intervals, facilitating release of CO2 
stored in the deep ocean to the atmosphere. Paleo evidence suggests significant reduction of deep-ocean 
ventilation associated with meltwater input during times of peak warmth. {2.3.1.1, 2.3.3.1, 9.2.2, 9.2.3.2}  </p>

<p><em>Carbon cycle.</em> Past climate states were associated with substantial differences in the inventories of the 
various carbon reservoirs, including the atmosphere (TS.2.2). Since AR5, the quantification of carbon stocks 
has improved due to the development of novel sedimentary proxies and stable-isotope analyses of air trapped 
in polar ice. Terrestrial carbon storage decreased markedly during the Last Glacial Maximum by 300–600 
PgC, possibly by 850 PgC when accounting for interactions with the lithosphere and ocean sediments, a 
larger reduction than previously estimated, owing to colder and drier climate. At the same time, the storage 
of remineralised carbon in the ocean interior increased by as much as 750–950 PgC, sufficient to balance the 
removal of carbon from the atmosphere (200 PgC) and terrestrial biosphere reservoirs combined (high 
confidence). {5.1.2.2} </p>
