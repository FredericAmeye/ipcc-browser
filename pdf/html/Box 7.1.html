<p>The forcing and response energy budget framework provides a methodology to assess the effect of individual 
drivers of global mean surface temperature response, and to facilitate the understanding of the key 
phenomena that set the magnitude of this temperature response. The framework used here is developed from 
that adopted in previous IPCC reports (see Ramaswamy et al., 2019 for a discussion). Effective Radiative 
Forcing (ERF), introduced in AR5 (Boucher et al., 2013; Myhre et al., 2013b) is more explicitly defined in 
this report and is employed as the central definition of radiative forcing (Sherwood et al. 2015, Box 7.1, 
Figure 1a). The framework has also been extended to allow variations in feedbacks over different timescales 
and with changing climate state (Section 7.4.4; Section 7.4.3).   </p>

<p>The GSAT response to perturbations that give rise to an energy imbalance is traditionally approximated by 
the following linear energy budget equation, in which ŒîN represents the change in the top-of-atmosphere 
(TOA) net energy flux, ŒîF is an effective radiative forcing perturbation to the TOA net energy flux, Œ±  is the 
net feedback parameter and ŒîT is the change in GSAT: </p>

<p>$$ \Delta N = \Delta F + \alpha  \Delta T $$
Box 7.1, Equation (7.1) </p>

<p>ERF is the TOA energy budget change resulting from the perturbation, excluding any radiative response related to a change in GSAT (i.e., ŒîT =0). Climate feedbacks (Œ±) represent those processes that change the 
TOA energy budget in response to a given ŒîT.  </p>

<p>The effective radiative forcing, ERF (ŒîF; units: W m-2) quantifies the change in the net TOA energy flux of 
the Earth system due to an imposed perturbation (e.g., changes in greenhouse gas or aerosol concentrations, 
in incoming solar radiation, or land-use change). ERF is expressed as a change in net downward radiative 
flux at the TOA following adjustments in both tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures, water vapour, 
clouds, and some surface properties, such as surface albedo from vegetation changes, that are uncoupled to 
any GSAT change (Smith et al., 2018b). These adjustments affect the TOA energy balance and hence the 
ERF. They are generally assumed to be linear and additive (Section 7.3.1). Accounting for such processes 
gives an estimate of ERF that is more representative of the climate change response associated with forcing 
agents than stratospheric-temperature-adjusted radiative forcing (SARF) or the instantaneous radiative 
forcing (IRF) (Section 7.3.1). Adjustments are processes that are independent of GSAT change, whereas 
feedbacks refer to processes caused by GSAT change. Although adjustments generally occur on timescales 
of hours to several months, and feedbacks respond to ocean surface temperature changes on timescales of a 
year or more, timescale is not used to separate the definitions. ERF has often been approximated as the TOA 
energy balance change due to an imposed perturbation in climate model simulations with sea-surface 
temperature and sea-ice concentrations set to their pre-industrial climatological values (e.g., Forster et al., 
2016). However, to match the adopted forcing-feedback framework, the small effects of any GSAT change 
from changes in land surface temperatures need to be removed from the TOA energy balance in such 
simulations to give an approximate measure of ERF (Box 7.1, Figure 1b and Section 7.3.1).   </p>

<p>The <em>feedback parameter, Œ±</em> , (units: W‚ãÖm<sup>-2</sup> ¬∞C<sup>-1</sup>) quantifies the change in net energy flux at the TOA for a 
given change in GSAT. Many climate variables affect the TOA energy budget, and the feedback parameter can be decomposed, to first order, into a sum of terms \(\alpha = \sum_x {{\partial N } \over {\partial x}} {{\partial x} \over {\partial T}}\), where x represents a variable of the 
Earth system that has a direct effect on the energy budget at the TOA. The sum of the feedback terms (i.e., ùõº in Equation 7.1) governs Earth‚Äôs equilibrium GSAT response to an imposed ERF. In previous assessments, Œ± 
and the related ECS have been associated with a distinct set of physical processes (Planck response and 
changes in water vapour, lapse rate, surface albedo, and clouds) (Charney et al., 1979). In this assessment, a 
more general definition of Œ± and ECS is adopted such that they include additional Earth system processes 
that act across many timescales (e.g., changes in natural aerosol emissions or vegetation). Because, in our 
assessment, these additional processes sum to a near-zero value, including these additional processes does 
not change the assessed central value of ECS but does affect its assessed uncertainty range (Section 7.4.2). 
Note that there is no standardised notation or sign convention for the feedback parameter in the literature. </p>

<p>Here the convention is used that the sum of all feedback terms (the net feedback parameter, ùõº) is negative for a stable climate that radiates additional energy to space with a GSAT increase, with a more negative value of ùõº corresponding to a stronger radiative response and thus a smaller GSAT change required to balance a
change in ERF (Equation 7.1). A change in process x amplifies the temperature response to a forcing when 
the associated feedback parameter ùõº<sub>x</sub> is positive (positive feedback) and dampens the temperature response 
when ùõº<sub>x</sub> is negative (negative feedback). New research since AR5 emphasises how feedbacks can vary over 
different timescales (Section 7.4.4) and with climate state (Section 7.4.3), giving rise to the concept of an 
<i>effective feedback parameter</i> that may be different from the equilibrium value of the feedback parameter 
governing ECS (Section 7.4.3).  </p>

<p>The <em>equilibrium climate sensitivity, ECS</em> (units: ¬∞C), is defined as the equilibrium value of ŒîT in response to 
a sustained doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration from a pre-industrial reference state. The value of </p>

<p>ERF for this scenario is denoted by \(\Delta F_{2xCO2}\), giving \(ECS = - \Delta F_{2xCO2} / \alpha\) from Equation (7.1) applied at 
equilibrium (see Box 7.1, Figure 1a and Section 7.5). Equilibrium refers to a steady state where ŒîN averages 
to zero over a multi-century period. ECS is representative of the multi-century to millennial ŒîT response to 
\(\Delta F_{2xCO2}\), and is based on a CO2 concentration change so any feedbacks that affect the atmospheric 
concentration of CO2 do not influence its value. As employed here, ECS also excludes the long-term 
response of the ice sheets (Section 7.4.2.6) which may take multiple millennia to reach equilibrium, but 
includes all other feedbacks. Due to a number of factors, studies rarely estimate ECS or Œ± at equilibrium or 
under CO2 forcing alone. Rather, they give an effective feedback parameter (Section 7.4.1 and Box 7.1, 
Figure 1b) or an effective ECS (Section 7.5.1 and Box 7.1, Figure 1b), which represent approximations to the 
true values of Œ± or ECS. The effective ECS represents the equilibrium value of ŒîT in response to a sustained 
doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration that would occur assuming the effective feedback parameter 
applied at that equilibrium state. For example, a feedback parameter can be estimated from the linear slope 
of ŒîN against ŒîT over a set number of years within ESM simulations of an abrupt doubling or quadrupling of 
atmospheric CO2 (2√óCO2 or 4√óCO2, respectively), and the ECS can be estimated from the intersect of this 
regression line with ŒîN = 0 (see Box 7.1, Figure 1b). To infer ECS from a given estimate of effective ECS 
necessitates that assumptions are made for how ERF varies with CO2 concentration (Section 7.3.2) and how 
the slope of ŒîN against ŒîT relates to the slope of the straight line from ERF to ECS (see Section 7.5 and Box 
7.1, Figure 1b). Care has to be taken when comparing results across different lines of evidence to translate 
their estimates of the effective ECS into the ECS definition used here (Section 7.5.5).  </p>

<p>The <em>transient climate response, TCR</em> (units: ¬∞C), is defined as the ŒîT for the hypothetical scenario in which 
CO2 increases at 1% yr<sup>-1</sup> from a pre-industrial reference state to the time of a doubling of atmospheric CO2 
concentration (year 70) (Section 7.5). TCR is based on a CO2 concentration change, so any feedbacks that 
affect the atmospheric concentration of CO2 do not influence its value. It is a measure of transient warming 
accounting for the strength of climate feedbacks and ocean heat uptake. The transient climate response to 
<em>cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide (TCRE)</em> is defined as the transient  ŒîT per 1000 Gt C of cumulative 
CO2 emission increase since preindustrial. TCRE combines information on the airborne fraction of 
cumulative CO2 emissions (the fraction of the total CO2 emitted that remains in the atmosphere at the time of 
doubling, which is determined by carbon cycle processes) with information on the TCR. TCR is assessed in 
this chapter, whereas TCRE is assessed in Chapter 5, Section 5.5.</p>
