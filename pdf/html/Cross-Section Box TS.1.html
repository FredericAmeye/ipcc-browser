<p>This box synthesizes the outcomes of the assessment of past, current and future global surface temperature. 
Global mean surface temperature (GMST) and global surface air temperature (GSAT) are the two primary 
metrics of global surface temperature used to estimate global warming in IPCC reports. GMST merges sea 
surface temperatures (SSTs) over the ocean and 2 m air temperature over land and sea ice areas and is used 
in most paleo, historical and present-day observational estimates. The GSAT metric is 2 m air temperature 
over all surfaces and is the diagnostic generally used from climate models. Changes in GMST and GSAT 
over time differ by at most 10% in either direction (high confidence), but conflicting lines of evidence from 
models and direct observations, combined with limitations in theoretical understanding, lead to low 
confidence in the sign of any difference in long-term trend. Therefore, long-term changes in GMST/GSAT 
are presently assessed to be identical, with expanded uncertainty in GSAT estimates. Hence the term global 
surface temperature is used in reference to both quantities in the text of the TS and SPM. {Cross-Chapter Box 2.3} </p>

<p>Global surface temperature has increased by 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20] °C from 1850–1900 to 2011–2020, and the 
last decade was more likely than not warmer than any multi-centennial period after the Last Interglacial, 
roughly 125,000 years ago. The likely range of human-induced warming in global surface temperature in 
2010–2019 relative to 1850–1900 is 1.07 [0.8 to 1.3] °C, encompassing the observed warming, while the 
change attributable to natural forcing is only –0.1°C to +0.1°C. Compared to 1850–1900, average global 
surface temperature over the period 2081–2100 is very likely to be higher by 1.0°C–1.8°C in the low CO2 
emissions scenario SSP1-1.9 and by 3.3°C–5.7°C in the high CO2 emissions scenario SSP5-8.5. In all 
scenarios assessed here except SSP5-8.5, the central estimate of 20-year averaged global surface warming 
crossing the 1.5°C level lies in the early 2030s, which is about ten years earlier than the midpoint of the 
likely range (2030–2052) assessed in the SR1.5. It is more likely than not that under SSP1-1.9, global surface 
temperature relative to 1850–1900 will remain below 1.6°C throughout the 21st century, implying a potential 
temporary overshoot of 1.5°C global warming of no more than 0.1°C. Global surface temperature in any 
individual year, could exceed 1.5°C relative to 1850–1900 by 2030 with a likelihood between 40% and 60% 
across the scenarios considered here (medium confidence). A 2°C increase in global surface temperature 
relative to 1850–1900 will be crossed under SSP5-8.5 but is extremely unlikely to be crossed under SSP1-
1.9. Periods of reduced and increased GSAT trends at decadal time scales will continue to occur in the 21st 
century (very high confidence). The effect of strong mitigation on 20-year global surface temperature trends 
would be likely to emerge during the near term (2021–2040), assuming no major volcanic eruptions occur.

<h2>Surface Temperature History</h2>

<p>Dataset innovations, particularly more comprehensive representation of polar regions, and the availability of 
new datasets have led to an assessment of increased global surface temperature change relative to the directly 
equivalent estimates reported in AR5. The contribution of changes in observational understanding alone 
between AR5 and AR6 in assessing temperature changes from 1850–1900 to 1986–2005 is estimated at 0.08 
[–0.01 to 0.12] °C. From 1850–1900 to 1995–2014, global surface temperature increased by 0.85 [0.69 to 
0.95] °C, and to the most recent decade (2011–2020) by 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20] °C. Each of the last four decades 
has in turn been warmer than any decade that preceded it since 1850. Temperatures have increased faster 
over land than over the ocean since 1850–1900, with warming to 2011–2020 of 1.59 [1.34 to 1.83] °C over 
land and 0.88 [0.68 to 1.01] °C over the ocean. {2.3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 2.3} </p>

<p>Global surface temperature during the period 1850–1900 is used as an approximation for pre-industrial 
conditions for consistency with AR5 and AR6 Special Reports, whilst recognizing that radiative forcings 
have a baseline of 1750 for the start of anthropogenic influences. It is likely that there was a net 
anthropogenic forcing of 0.0–0.3 Wm-2 in 1850–1900 relative to 1750 (medium confidence), and from the 
period around 1750 to 1850–1900 there was a change in global surface temperature of around 0.1°C (likely 
range –0.1 to +0.3°C, medium confidence), with an anthropogenic component of 0.0°C–0.2°C (likely range, 
medium confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 1.2, 7.3.5}. </p>

<p>Global surface temperature has evolved over geological time (Figure TS.1, Box TS.2). Beginning 
approximately 6500 years ago, global surface temperature generally decreased, culminating in the coldest 
multi-century interval of the post-glacial period (since roughly 7000 years ago), which occurred between 
around 1450 and 1850 (high confidence). Over the last 50 years, global surface temperature has increased at 
an observed rate unprecedented in at least the last two thousand years (medium confidence), and it is more 
likely than not that no multi-centennial period after the Last Interglacial (roughly 125,000 years ago) was 
warmer globally than the most recent decade (Cross-Section Box TS.1, Figure 1). During the mid-Pliocene 
Warm Period, around 3.3–3.0 million years ago, global surface temperature was 2.5°C–4°C warmer, and 
during the Last Interglacial, it was 0.5°C–1.5°C warmer than 1850–1900 (medium confidence). {2.3.1, 
Cross-Chapter Box 2.1 and 2.4}  </p>

<h2>Current Warming</h2>

<p>There is <em>very high confidence</em> that the CMIP6 model ensemble reproduces observed global surface 
temperature trends and variability since 1850 with errors small enough for detection and attribution of 
human-induced warming. The CMIP6 multi-model mean global surface warming between 1850–1900 and 
2010–2019 is close to the best estimate of observed warming, though some CMIP6 models simulate a 
warming that is outside the assessed <em>very likely</em> observed range. {3.3.1} </p>

<p>The <em>likely</em> range of human-induced change in global surface temperature in 2010–201916 relative to 1850–
1900 is 1.07 [0.8 to 1.3] °C (Figure Cross-Section Box TS.1, Figure 1), encompassing the observed warming 
for that period of 1.06 [0.88 to 1.21] °C, while change attributable to natural forcing is only –0.1 to +0.1°C. 
This assessment is consistent with an estimate of the human-induced global surface temperature rise based 
on assessed ranges of perturbations to the top of the atmosphere (effective radiative forcing), and metrics of 
feedbacks of the climate response (equilibrium climate sensitivity and the transient climate response). Over 
the same period, well-mixed greenhouse gas forcing likely warmed global surface temperature by 1.0°C to 
2.0°C, while aerosols and other anthropogenic forcings likely cooled global surface temperature by 0.0°C to 
0.8°C. {2.3.1, 3.3.1, 7.3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 7.1} </p>

<p>The observed slower global surface temperature increase (relative to preceding and following periods) in the 
1998–2012 period, sometimes referred to as ‘the hiatus’, was temporary (very high confidence). The increase 
in global surface temperature during the 1998–2012 period is also greater in the data sets used in the AR6 
assessment than in those available at the time of AR5. Using these updated observational data sets and a like-
for-like consistent comparison of simulated and observed global surface temperature, all observed estimates 
of the 1998–2012 trend lie within the very likely range of CMIP6 trends. Since 2012, global surface 
temperature has warmed strongly, with the past five years (2016–2020) being the hottest five-year period 
between 1850 and 2020 (high confidence). {2.3.1, 3.3.1, 3.5.1, Cross-Chapter Box 3.1} </p>

<h2>Future Changes in Global Surface Temperature</h2>

<p>The AR6 assessment of future change in global surface temperature is, for the first time in an IPCC report, 
explicitly constructed by combining new projections for the SSP scenarios with observational constraints 
based on past simulated warming as well as the AR6-updated assessment of equilibrium climate sensitivity 
and transient climate response. Climate forecasts initialized from the observed climate state have in addition 
been used for the period 2019–2028. The inclusion of additional lines of evidence has reduced the assessed 
uncertainty ranges for each scenario (Cross-Section Box TS.1, Figure 1). {4.3.1, 4.3.4, Box 4.1, 7.5}  </p>

<p>During the near term (2021–2040), a 1.5°C increase in global surface temperature, relative to 1850–1900, is 
very likely to occur in scenario SSP5-8.5, likely to occur in scenarios SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0, and more likely 
than not to occur in scenarios SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6. The time of crossing a warming level here is defined 
here as the midpoint of the first 20-year period during which the average global surface temperature exceeds 
the level. In all scenarios assessed here except SSP5-8.5, the central estimate of crossing the 1.5°C level lies 
in the early 2030s. This is about ten years earlier than the midpoint of the likely range (2030–2052) assessed 
in the SR1.5, which assumed continuation of the then-current warming rate; this rate has been confirmed in 
the AR6. Roughly half of the ten-year difference arises from a larger historical warming diagnosed in AR6. 
The other half arises because for central estimates of climate sensitivity, most scenarios show stronger 
warming over the near term than was estimated as ‘current’ in SR1.5 (medium confidence). (Cross-Section Box TS.1, Table 1) {2.3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 2.3, 3.3.1, 4.3.4, Box 4.1} </p>

<p>It is more likely than not that under SSP1-1.9, global surface temperature relative to 1850–1900 will remain 
below 1.6°C throughout the 21st century, implying a potential temporary overshoot of 1.5°C global warming 
of no more than 0.1°C. If climate sensitivity lies near the lower end of the assessed very likely range, 
crossing the 1.5°C warming level is avoided in scenarios SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 (medium confidence). 
Global surface temperature in any individual year, in contrast to the 20-year average, could by 2030 exceed 
1.5°C relative to 1850–1900 with a likelihood between 40% and 60%, across the scenarios considered here 
(medium confidence). (Cross-Section Box TS.1, Table 1) {4.3.4, 4.4.1, Box 4.1, 7.5}  </p>

<p>During the 21st century, a 2°C increase in global surface temperature relative to 1850–1900 will be crossed 
under SSP5-8.5 and SSP3-7.0, will extremely likely be crossed under SSP2-4.5, but is unlikely to be crossed 
under SSP1-2.6 and extremely unlikely to be crossed under SSP1-1.9. For the mid-term period 2041–2060, 
this 2°C global warming level is very likely to be crossed under SSP5-8.5, likely to be crossed under SSP3-
7.0, and more likely than not to be crossed under SSP2-4.5. (Cross-Section Box TS.1, Table 1) {4.3.4} </p>

<p>Events of reduced and increased global surface temperature trends at decadal timescales will continue to 
occur in the 21st century, but will not affect the centennial warming (very high confidence). If strong 
mitigation is applied from 2020 onward as reflected in SSP1-1.9, its effect on 20-year trends in global 
surface temperature would likely emerge during the near term (2021–2040), measured against an assumed 
non-mitigation scenario such as SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5. All statements about crossing the 1.5°C level 
assume that no major volcanic eruption occurs during the near term (Cross-Section Box TS.1, Table 1). 
{2.3.1, Cross-chapter Box 2.3, 4.3.4, 4.4.1, 4.6.3, Box 4.1} </p>

<p>Compared to 1850–1900, average global surface temperature over the period 2081–2100 is very likely to be 
higher by 1.0°C–1.8°C in the low CO2 emissions scenario SSP1-1.9 and by 3.3°C–5.7°C in the high CO2 
emissions scenario SSP5-8.5. For the scenarios SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP3-7.0, the corresponding very 
likely ranges are 1.3°C–2.4°C, 2.1°C–3.5°C, and 2.8°C–4.6°C, respectively. The uncertainty ranges for the 
period 2081–2100 continue to be dominated by the uncertainty in equilibrium climate sensitivity and 
transient climate response (very high confidence) (Cross-Section Box TS.1, Table 1). {4.3.1, 4.3.4, 4.4.1, 
7.5} </p>

<p>The CMIP6 models project a wider range of global surface temperature change than the assessed range (high 
confidence); furthermore, the CMIP6 global surface temperature increase tends to be larger than in CMIP5 
(very high confidence). {4.3.1, 4.3.4, 4.6.2, 7.5.6} </p>
