<h3>Observed changes</h3>

<p>AR5 did not highlight observed changes in water cycle seasonality and SRCCL mostly emphasized changes 
in vegetation seasonality. Since AR5, a number of relevant studies have been published, but often with 
conflicting results. Based on three in situ datasets, reduced precipitation seasonality was identified over 62% 
of the terrestrial ecosystems analysed from 1950-2009 (Murray-Tortarolo et al. 2017). In contrast, both in 
situ and satellite data show a general increase in the annual range of precipitation from 1979 to 2010, which 
is dominated by wetter wet seasons (Chou et al., 2013). This paradox may be partly explained by a larger 
aerosol radiative forcing in the middle of the 20th century as well as by internal variability (Kumar et al., 
2015; see also Box 8.1). For instance, the “long rains” over East Africa experienced declining trends in the 
1980s and 1990s (Nicholson, 2017), which was linked to anthropogenic aerosols and SST patterns (Rowell 
et al., 2015), followed by a recent recovery that was linked to internal variability (Wainwright et al., 2019). 
Two satellite datasets revealed decreased rainfall seasonality in the tropics but an increased seasonality in the 
subtropics and mid-latitudes since 1979, without clear attribution (Marvel et al., 2017). </p>

<p>Large differences have been found across seven global precipitation datasets, with no region showing a 
consistent, statistically significant, positive or negative trend over the last three decades (Tan et al., 2020b). 
Regional studies suggest that observed changes in precipitation seasonality are neither uniform nor stable 
across the 20th century (Li et al., 2016a; Mallakpour and Villarini, 2017; Sahany et al., 2018; Deng et al., 
2019). Since the 1980s, there is however growing evidence that contrasts between wet and dry regimes, 
including seasonality, have increased (Liu and Allan, 2013; Polson et al., 2013; Murray-Tortarolo et al., 
2016; Tapiador et al., 2016; Gallego et al., 2017; Polson and Hegerl, 2017; Barkhordarian et al., 2018; Lan et 
al., 2019; Liang et al., 2020; Schurer et al., 2020).  </p>

<p>Additional changes in seasonality may manifest in the timing and duration of wet seasons. A later monsoon 
onset trend was reported throughout India from 1901 to 2013 (Sahany et al., 2018). Conversely, an earlier 
rainfall onset was implicated in increased springtime rainfall over the Tibetan Plateau in recent decades 
(Zhang et al., 2017c). Winter and early spring precipitation over the northwestern Himalaya for the period 
1951-2007 shows an increasing trend of daily precipitation extremes in association with enhanced amplitude 
variations of extra-tropical synoptic-scale systems known as “Western Disturbances” (Cannon et al., 2015; </p>

<p>Krishnan et al., 2019; Madhura et al., 2014). In China, an earlier onset was observed during 1961-2012 
(Deng et al., 2019). In the African Sahel, rainfall has been most concentrated in the peak of the rainy season 
since the end of the 20th century (Biasutti, 2019). A shift in the seasonality of Sahelian rainfall, including 
delayed cessation has also been reported (Nicholson, 2013; Dunning et al., 2018) (Section 10.4.2.1). Over 
southern Africa, an observed earlier onset (1985-2007) is in contrast to a simulated historical and projected 
future delay in the wet season (Maidment et al., 2015; Dunning et al., 2018). An increasingly early onset of 
the North American monsoon has been observed from 1978 to 2009 (Arias et al., 2015). Seasonality changes 
in the South American monsoon indicate delayed onsets since 1978 (Fu et al., 2013; Yin et al., 2014; Arias et 
al., 2015; Debortoli et al., 2015; Arvor et al., 2017; Giráldez et al., 2020; Haghtalab et al., 2020; Correa et 
al., 2021).  </p>

<p>In northern high latitudes, a shorter snow season (Zeng et al., 2018a) is mainly due to an earlier onset of 
spring snowmelt (Peng et al., 2013) which has been attributed to anthropogenic climate change (Najafi et al., 
2016). Changes in snow seasonality affect streamflow at the regional scale, with an earlier peak in spring and 
a possible decrease of low-level flow in summer (Berghuijs et al., 2014; Kang et al., 2016; Dudley et al., 
2017), while glacier shrinking can also alter the low-level flow in mountain catchments (Lutz et al., 2014; 
Milner et al., 2017; Huss and Hock, 2018). This can be partly ameliorated by water management in regulated 
catchments (Arheimer et al., 2017), but not in large river basins such as the Amazon which also shows an 
increased seasonality of discharge since 1979 (Liang et al., 2020). </p>

<p>Increasing aridity contrasts between wet and dry seasons over the late 20th century have been suggested 
(Kumar et al., 2015), with a human-induced decrease of water availability during the dry season over 
Europe, western North America, northern Asia, southern South America, Australia and eastern Africa 
(Padrón et al., 2020). Seasonal contrasts in microwave surface soil moisture measurements have also 
increased over 1979-2016 (Pan et al., 2019). Terrestrial water storage variations derived from gravimetric 
measurements since 2003 show a strong seasonality which is underestimated by global hydrological models 
(Scanlon et al., 2019) and whose multidecadal trends are difficult to interpret given the direct effect of 
enhanced water use (Rodell et al., 2018; Scanlon et al., 2018). </p>

<p>In summary, there is medium confidence that the annual range of precipitation has increased since the 1980s, 
at least in subtropical regions and over the Amazon. There is low confidence that this increase is due to 
human influence and that GHG forcing has already altered the timing or duration of wet seasons. There is 
high confidence that the human-induced retreat of the springtime snow cover and melting of glaciers have 
already contributed to changes in streamflow seasonality in high-latitude and low-elevation mountain 
catchments, and medium confidence that human activities have also contributed to an increased seasonality 
of water availability, including a drier dry season, in the extratropics. </p>

<h3>Projected changes</h3>

<p>AR5 reported with high confidence that the contrast between wet and dry seasons will generally increase 
with global warming and that monsoon onset dates will likely become earlier or show little change, while 
monsoon retreat dates will likely be delayed, resulting in a lengthening of the wet season in many regions.  </p>

<p>Since AR5, several studies have further documented a projected increase in rainfall seasonality and the 
understanding of the underlying mechanisms has been improved (Sections 8.2.1 and 8.3.2). CMIP5 models 
show that the seasonal concentration of annual precipitation will increase over many regions by the end of 
the 21st century, with robust model agreement in most subtropical regions where an increase in the mean 
number of dry days was also reported in the RCP8.5 scenario (Pascale et al., 2016). The semi-arid, winter 
rainfall dominated subtropical climate is projected to shift poleward and eastward, with the equatorward 
margins replaced by a more arid climate type. However,  evolving SST patterns and land-ocean warming 
contrasts cause more complex responses (Alessandri et al., 2015; Polade et al., 2017; Brogli et al., 2019; 
Zappa et al., 2020). Projections over California show a stronger and shorter wet season (Polade et al., 2017; 
Dong et al., 2019). Decreases in future winter and spring rainfall are projected over southwestern Australia 
(Hope et al., 2015). Central Asia is projected to experience wetter winters, associated with an increase in 
snow depth in the northeastern regions (Li et al., 2019b). Even in a +2°C climate, both extreme precipitation 
and dryness will increase significantly in the extratropics, amplifying the seasonal precipitation range (Fujita 
et al., 2018). A single-model study shows that the annual range of precipitation increases globally by 2.6% 
per °C of global warming in stabilized low-warming scenarios (Chen et al., 2020f). </p>

<p>In the tropics, an amplified annual cycle (by ~3–5%/°C) of global land monsoon hydroclimates (P, P − E, 
and runoff) is projected by CMIP5 models under the RCP8.5 scenario, mostly due to a more intense wet 
season (Zhang et al., 2019c). A longer rainy season is projected by CMIP6 models over most regional 
monsoon areas except in the Americas (Moon and Ha, 2020). A delayed onset and cessation of the wet 
season over West Africa and the Sahel (Dunning et al., 2018) and a slightly delayed onset of South Asian 
monsoon rainfall (Hasson et al., 2016) are projected by CMIP5 models. CMIP5 projections suggest a 
strengthening of the annual cycle and a lengthening of the dry season in Southern Amazonia (Fu et al., 2013; 
Reboita et al., 2014; Boisier et al., 2015; Pascale et al., 2016; Sena and Magnusdottir, 2020). This is further 
verified by the projections from 6 CMIP6 models (Moon and Ha, 2020). A wet season shorter by 5-10 days 
by the end to the 21st century is projected for southern Africa (Dunning et al., 2018).  </p>

<p>An increase in streamflow seasonality is projected over several large rivers in the low-mitigation RCP8.5 
scenario, but with only small changes in the seasonality timing, except in northern high latitudes due to the 
earlier but potentially slower snowmelt in a warmer world (Eisner et al., 2017; Musselman et al., 2017). At 
the end of the century in a high-emission scenario, peak snowmelt timing is projected to occur one month 
earlier and peak water volume is 79% lower in the eastern USA (Rhoades et al., 2018). Earlier snow melt is 
projected e.g. by 30 days at the end of the 21st century in RCP4.5 for the Sierra Nevada in the western USA 
(Sun et al., 2018b). Sub-seasonal changes in water availability were found in many regions in the RCP8.5 
scenario. However these should be considered with caution given the magnitude of model errors (Ferguson 
et al., 2018a). Increases in the seasonality of water availability has been found to be more pronounced in 
areas with high atmospheric evaporative demand, giving rise to a pattern of seasonally variable regimes 
becoming even more variable (Konapala et al., 2020). RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 projections show a pronounced 
soil drying in summer and autumn over western Europe, and a springtime drying over northern Europe due 
to an earlier snowmelt (Ruosteenoja et al., 2018).  </p>

<p>A simple relative seasonality metric (Walsh and Lawler, 1981) applied to global projections based on CMIP6 
models and SSP scenarios supports previous CMIP5 findings, especially the amplified seasonality of 
precipitation around the Mediterranean, and across southern Africa, California, southern Australia and the 
Amazon (Box 8.2, Figure 1). While such changes are not significant in the low-emission SSP1-2.6 scenario, 
they are consistent with the increased frequency of dry days projected over the same regions (Figure 8.16). 
In monsoon regions outside the Americas, rainfall seasonality does not show a significant increase even in 
high-emission scenarios. This challenges previous CMIP5 findings based on the difference between 
maximum and minimum monthly precipitation in a year (Zhang et al., 2019c) and higher sensitivity to the 
projected increase in precipitation extremes (Section 11.4.5). In the northern high-latitudes, milder winters 
are associated with wetter conditions and a decrease in precipitation seasonality. </p>

<p>In summary, the annual range of precipitation, water availability and streamflow will increase with global 
warming over subtropical regions and the Amazon (medium confidence), especially around the 
Mediterranean and across southern Africa (high confidence). The contrast between the wettest and driest 
month of the year is likely to increase by 3 to 5%/°C with global warming in most monsoon regions, in terms 
of precipitation, water availability (P-E) and runoff (medium confidence). There is medium confidence that 
the monsoon season could be delayed in a warmer climate in the Sahel. There is high confidence of earlier 
snowmelt.</p>
