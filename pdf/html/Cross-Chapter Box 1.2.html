<p>The Paris Agreement aims to limit global temperatures to specific thresholds ‘above pre-industrial levels’. In 
AR6 WGI, as in previous IPCC reports, observations and projections of changes in global temperature are 
generally expressed relative to 1850–1900 as an approximate pre-industrial state (SR1.5, IPCC, 2018). This 
is a pragmatic choice based upon data availability considerations, though both anthropogenic and natural 
changes to the climate occurred before 1850. The remaining carbon budgets, the chance of crossing global 
temperature thresholds, and projections of extremes and sea level rise at a particular level of global warming 
can all be sensitive to the chosen definition of the approximate pre-industrial baseline (Millar et al., 2017a; 
Schurer et al., 2017; Pfleiderer et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2019; Tokarska et al., 2019). This Cross-Chapter 
Box assesses the evidence on change in radiative forcing and global temperature from the period around 
1750 to 1850–1900; variations in the climate before 1750 are discussed in Chapter 2.  </p>

<p>Although there is some evidence for human influence on climate before 1750 (e.g., Ruddiman and Thomson, 
2001; Koch et al., 2019), the magnitude of the effect is still disputed (e.g., Joos et al., 2004; Beck et al., 
2018b; see Chapter 5, Section 5.1.2.3), and most studies analyse the human influence on climate over the 
industrial period. Historically, the widespread use of coal-powered machinery started the Industrial 
Revolution in Britain in the late 18th century (Ashton, 1997), but the global effects were small for several 
decades. In line with this, previous IPCC assessment reports considered changes in radiative forcing relative 
to 1750, and temperature changes were often reported relative to the ‘late 19th century’. AR5 and SR1.5 
made the specific pragmatic choice to approximate pre-industrial global temperatures by the average of the 
1850–1900 period, when permanent surface observing networks emerged that provide sufficiently accurate 
and continuous measurements on a near-global scale (see Sections 1.3.1 and Chapter 2, Section 2.3.1.1), and 
because the model simulations of the historical period used 1850 as their start date. For the same reasons, to 
ensure continuity with previous assessments, and because of larger uncertainties and lower confidence in 
climatic changes before 1850 than after, AR6 makes the same choice to approximate pre-industrial global 
temperatures by the average of the 1850-1900 period.  </p>

<p>Here we assess improvements in our understanding of climatic changes in the period 1750-1850. 
Anthropogenic influences on climate between 1750 and 1900 were primarily increased anthropogenic GHG 
and aerosol emissions, and changes in land use. Between 1750 and 1850 atmospheric CO2 levels increased 
by from about 278 ppm to about 285 ppm (Chapter 2, Section 2.2.3, equivalent to around 3 years of current 
rates of increase), corresponding to about 55 GtCO2 in the atmosphere. Estimates of emissions from fossil 
fuel burning (about 4 GtCO2, Boden et al., 2017) cannot explain the pre-1850 increase, so CO2 emissions 
from land use changes are implicated as the dominant source. The atmospheric concentration of other GHGs 
also increased over the same period, and there was a cooling influence from other anthropogenic radiative 
forcings (such as aerosols and land use changes), but with a larger uncertainty than for GHGs (e.g., Carslaw 
et al., 2017; Owens et al., 2017; Hamilton et al., 2018; Chapter 2, Section 2.2.6; Chapter 7, Section 7.3.5.2; 
Cross-Chapter Box 1.2, Figure 1). It is likely that there was a net anthropogenic forcing of 0.0–0.3 Wm-2 in 
1850–1900 relative to 1750 (medium confidence). The net radiative forcing from changes in solar activity 
and volcanic activity in 1850–1900, compared to the period around 1750, is estimated to be smaller than 
± 0.1 W m-2, but note there were several large volcanic eruptions between 1750 and 1850 (Cross-Chapter 
Box 1.2, Figure 1). </p>

<p>Several studies since AR5 have estimated changes in global temperatures following industrialisation and 
before 1850. Hawkins et al. (2017) used observations, radiative forcing estimates and model simulations to 
estimate the warming from 1720–1800 until 1986–2005 and assessed a likely range of 0.55°C–0.80°C, 
slightly broader than the equivalent range starting from 1850–1900 (0.6°C–0.7°C). From proxy evidence, 
PAGES 2k Consortium (2019) found that GMST for 1850–1900 was 0.02°C [-0.22 to 0.16°C] warmer than 
the 30-year period centred on 1750. Schurer et al. (2017) used climate model simulations of the last 
millennium to estimate that the increase in GHG concentrations before 1850 caused an additional likely 
range of 0.0–0.2°C global warming when considering multiple reference periods. Haustein et al. (2017) 
implies an additional warming of around 0.05°C attributable to human activity from 1750 to 1850–1900, and 
the AR6 emulator (Chapter 7, Section 7.3.5.3) estimates the likely range of this warming to be 0.04°C–
0.14°C.  </p>

<p>Combining these different sources of evidence, we assess that from the period around 1750 to 1850–1900 
there was a change in global temperature of around 0.1°C <a href="medium confidence">-0.1 to +0.3°C</a>, with an 
anthropogenic component of a likely range of 0.0°C–0.2°C (medium confidence). </p>
