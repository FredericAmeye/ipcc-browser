<p>This box summarizes the information on linking global and regional climate change information in the Fifth 
Assessment Report (AR5) and the three Special Reports of the Sixth Assessment Cycle. This information 
frames the treatment of the production of regional climate information in previous reports and identifies 
some of the gaps that AR6 needs to address. </p>

<h3>AR5</h3>

<p>In the WGI Chapter 9 (Flato et al., 2014), regional downscaling methods were addressed as tools to provide 
climate information at the scales needed for many climate impact studies. The assessment found high 
confidence that downscaling adds value both in regions with highly variable topography and for various 
small-scale phenomena. Regional models necessarily inherit biases from the global models used to provide 
boundary conditions. Furthermore, the ability of AR5 to systematically evaluate RCMs, and statistical 
downscaling schemes, were hampered because coordinated inter-comparison studies were still emerging. 
However, several studies demonstrated that added value arises from higher resolution in regions where 
stationary small-scale features like topography and complex coastlines are present, and from improved 
representation of small-scale processes like convective precipitation. </p>

<p>WGI Chapter 14 (Christensen et al., 2013) stressed that credibility in regional climate change projections 
increases when key drivers of the change are known to be well-simulated and well-projected by climate 
models. </p>

<p>The Working Group II (WGII) Chapter 21 (Hewitson et al., 2014b) addressed the regional climate change 
context from the perspective of impacts, vulnerability and adaptation. This chapter emphasized that a good 
understanding of decision-making contexts is essential to define the type and scale of information required 
from physical climate. Further, the chapter identified that the regional climate information was limited by the 
paucity of comprehensive observations and their analysis along with the different levels of confidence in 
projections (high confidence). Notably, at the time of the AR5, many studies still relied on global datasets, 
models, and assessment methods to inform regional decisions, which were not considered as effective as 
tailored regional approaches. The regional scale was not defined but instead it was emphasised that climate 
change responses play out on a range of scales, and the relevance and limitations of information differ 
strongly from global to local scales, and from one region to another. </p>

<p>Chapter 21 noted that the production of downscaled datasets (by both dynamical and statistical methods) 
remains weakly coordinated, and that results indicate that high-resolution downscaled reconstructions of the 
current climate can have significant errors. Key in this was that the increase in downscaled data sets has not 
narrowed the uncertainty range, and that integrating these data with historical change and process-based 
understanding remains an important challenge. </p>

<p>The chapter identified the common perception that higher resolution (i.e., more spatial detail) equates to 
more usable and robust information, which is not necessarily true. Instead, it is through the integration of 
multiple sources of information that robust understanding of change is developed. </p>

<p>WGII Chapter 21 highlighted that the different contexts of an impact study are defining features for how 
climate risk is perceived. Perspectives were characterized as top-down (physical vulnerability) and bottom-
up perspectives (social vulnerability). The top-down perspective uses climate change impacts as the starting 
point of how people and/or ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change, and commonly applies global-scale 
scenario information or refine this to the region of interest through downscaling procedures. Conversely, in 
the “bottom-up” approach the development context is the starting point, focusing on local scales, and layers 
climate change on top of this. An impact focus tends to look to the future to see how to adjust to expected 
changes, whereas a vulnerability-focused approach is centred on addressing the drivers of current 
vulnerability. </p>

<h3>Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL; IPCC, 2019a)</h3>

<p>The SRCCL (Jia et al., 2019) assessed that there is robust evidence and high agreement that land cover and 
land use or management exert significant influence on atmospheric states (e.g., temperature, rainfall, wind 
intensity) and phenomena (e.g., monsoons), at various spatial and temporal scales, through their biophysical 
influences on climate. There is robust evidence that dry soil moisture anomalies favour summer heat waves. 
Part of the projected increase in heat waves and droughts can be attributed to soil moisture feedbacks in 
regions where evapotranspiration is limited by moisture availability (medium confidence). Vegetation 
changes can also amplify or dampen extreme events through changes in albedo and evapotranspiration, 
which will influence future trends in extreme events (medium confidence). </p>

<p>The influence of different changes in land use (e.g., afforestation, urbanization), on the local climate depends 
on the background climate (robust evidence, high agreement). There is high confidence that regional climate 
change can be dampened or enhanced by changes in local land cover and land use, with sign and magnitude 
depending on region and season. </p>

<p>Water management and irrigation were generally not accounted for by CMIP5 global models available at the 
time of the SRCCL. Additional water can modify regional energy and moisture balance particularly in areas 
with highly productive agricultural crops with high rate of evapotranspiration. Urbanization increases the 
risks associated with extreme events (high confidence). Urbanization suppresses evaporative cooling and 
amplifies heatwave intensity (high confidence) with a strong influence on minimum temperatures (very 
likely, high confidence). Urban areas enhance storm occurrence and heavy precipitation in part due to the 
presence of aerosols. Urbanization also increases the risk of flooding during heavy rain events. </p>

<h3>Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC; IPCC, 2019b)</h3>

<p>The SROCC (IPCC, 2019b) stated that observations and models for assessing changes in the ocean and the 
cryosphere have been developed considerably during the past century but observations in some key regions 
remain under-sampled and were very short relative to the time scales of natural variability and anthropogenic 
changes. Retreat of mountain glaciers and thawing of mountain permafrost continues and will continue due 
to significant warming in those regions, where it is likely to exceed global temperature increase. </p>

<p>SROCC assessed that it is virtually certain that Antarctica and Greenland have lost mass over the past 
decade and observed glacier mass loss over the last decades is attributable to anthropogenic climate change 
(high confidence). It is virtually certain that projected warming will result in continued loss in Arctic sea ice 
in summer, but there is low confidence in climate model projections of Antarctic sea ice change because of 
model biases and disagreement with observed trends. Knowledge and observations of the polar regions were 
sparse compared to many other regions, due to remoteness and challenges of operating in them. </p>

<p>The sensitivity of small islands and coastal areas to increased sea level differs between emission scenarios 
and regionally and a consideration of local processes is critical for projections of sea level influences at local 
scales. </p>

<h3>Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5; IPCC, 2018b)</h3>

<p>The SR1.5 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018) assessed that most land regions were experiencing greater warming 
than the global average, with annual average warming already exceeding 1.5°C in many regions. Over one 
quarter of the global population live in regions that have already experienced more than 1.5°C of warming in 
at  least  one  season.  Land  regions  will  warm  more  than  ocean  regions  over  the  coming  decades  (transient 
climate conditions). </p>

<p>Transient climate projections reveal observable differences between 1.5°C and 2°C global warming in terms 
of mean temperature and extremes, both at a global scale and for most land regions. Such studies also reveal 
detectable differences between 1.5°C and 2°C precipitation extremes in many land regions. For mean 
precipitation and various drought measures there is substantially lower risk for human systems and 
ecosystems in the Mediterranean region at 1.5°C compared to 2°C. </p>

<p>The different pathways to a 1.5ºC warmer world may involve a transition through 1.5°C, with both short and 
long-term stabilization (without overshoot), or a temporary rise and fall over decades and centuries 
(overshoot). The influence of these pathways is small for some climate variables at the regional scale (e.g., 
regional temperature and precipitation extremes) but can be very large for others (e.g., sea level). </p>
