<p><em>The global stocktake under the Paris Agreement (PA) evaluates the collective progress of countries’ 
actions towards attaining the Agreement’s purpose and long-term goals every five years.</em> The first 
global stocktake is due in 2023, and then every five years thereafter, unless otherwise decided by the 
Conference of the Parties. The purpose and long-term goals of the PA are captured in Article 2: to 
‘strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, in the context of sustainable development and 
efforts to eradicate poverty, including by’: mitigation3, specifically, ‘holding the increase in the global 
average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the 
temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce 
the risks and impacts of climate change’; adaptation, that is, ‘Increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse 
impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions development, in a 
manner that does not threaten food production’; and means of implementation and support, that is, ‘Making 
finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient 
development’. </p>

<p>The PA further specifies that the stocktake shall be undertaken in a ‘comprehensive and facilitative manner, 
considering mitigation, adaptation and the means of implementation and support, and in the light of equity 
and the best available science’ (Article 14).  </p>

<p><em>The sources of input</em> envisaged for the global stocktake include the ‘latest reports of the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change’ as a central source of information4. The global stocktake is one of the key formal 
avenues for scientific inputs into the UNFCCC and PA negotiation process alongside, for example, the 
Structured Expert Dialogues under the UNFCCC5 (Section 1.2.2). </p>

<p><em>The WGI assessment provides a wide range of information potentially relevant for the global 
stocktake, complementing the IPCC AR6 Special Reports, the contributions from WGII and WGIII 
and the Synthesis Report.</em> This includes the state of greenhouse gas emissions and concentrations, the 
current state of the climate, projected long-term warming levels under different scenarios, near-term 
projections, the attribution of extreme events, and remaining carbon budgets. Cross-Chapter Box 1.1, Table 1 
provide pointers to the in-depth material that WGI has assessed and may be relevant for the global stocktake.  </p>

<p><em>The following tabularised overview of potentially relevant information from the WGI contribution for 
the global stocktake is structured into three sections: the current state of the climate, the long-term 
future, and the near-term.</em> These sections and their order align with the three questions of the Talanoa 
dialogue, launched during COP23 based on the Pacific concept of talanoa6: ‘Where are we’, ‘Where do we 
want to go’ and ‘How do we get there?’.</p>
