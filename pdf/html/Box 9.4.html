<p>In this box, we outline a storyline (Glossary, Box 10.2 (Shepherd et al., 2018)) for high-end sea-level 
projections for 2100. This storyline considers processes whose quantification is highly uncertain regarding 
the timing of their possible onset and/or their potential to accelerate sea-level rise. These processes are 
therefore not considered for the assessed upper bound of likely sea-level rise by 2100 in section 9.6.3.3, as 
the likely range includes only processes that can be projected skilfully with at least medium confidence 
(based on agreement and evidence).  </p>

<p>As noted by the SROCC, stakeholders with a low risk tolerance (e.g., those planning for coastal safety in 
cities and long-term investment in critical infrastructure) may wish to consider global-mean sea-level rise 
above the assessed likely range by the year 2100, because “likely” implies an assessed likelihood of up to 16 
% that sea-level rise by 2100 will be higher (see also (Siegert et al., 2020)). Because of our limited 
understanding of the rate at which some of the governing processes contribute to long-term sea-level rise, we 
cannot currently robustly quantify the likelihood with which they can cause higher sea-level rise before 2100 
(Stammer et al., 2019).  </p>

<p>In light of such deep uncertainty, we employ a storyline approach in examining the potential for, and early-
warning signals of a high-end sea-level scenario unfolding within this century. In doing so, we note upfront 
that the main uncertainty related to high-end sea-level rise is “when" rather than “if” it arises: the upper limit 
of 1.02 m of likely sea-level range by 2100 for the SSP 5-8.5 scenario will be exceeded in any future 
warming scenario on time scales of centuries to millennia (high confidence), but it is uncertain how quickly 
the long-term committed sea level will be reached (Section 9.6.3.5). Hence, global-mean sea level might rise 
well above the likely range before 2100, which is reflected by assessments of ice-sheet contributions based 
on structured expert judgment (Bamber et al., 2019) leading to a 95th percentile of projected future sea-level 
rise as high as 2.3 m in 2100 (Section 9.6.3.3). </p>

<p>A plausible storyline for such high-end sea-level rise in 2100 assumes a strong warming scenario (Section 
4.8). The storyline considers faster-than-projected disintegration of marine ice shelves and the abrupt, 
widespread onset of Marine Ice Cliff Instability (MICI) and Marine Ice Sheet Instability (MISI) in Antarctica 
(Section 9.4.2.4), and faster-than-projected changes in both the surface mass balance and dynamical ice loss 
in Greenland. While conceptual studies provide medium evidence of these processes, substantial 
uncertainties and low agreement in quantifying their future evolution arise from limited process 
understanding, limited availability of evaluation data, missing or crude representation in model simulations, 
their high sensitivity to uncertain boundary conditions and parameters, and/or uncertain atmosphere and 
ocean forcing (Sections 9.4.1.2; 9.4.2.2).  </p>

<p>In Antarctica, high warming might lead to floating ice shelves starting to break up earlier than expected due 
to processes not yet accounted for in ice-sheet models or in current climate models used to force ice-sheet 
projections. Such processes include hydrofracturing driven by surface meltwater and increase in ocean 
thermal forcing driven by ocean circulation changes (Sections 9.2.2.3, 9.2.3.2, 9.4.2.3) (Hellmer et al., 2012, 
2017; Silvano et al., 2018; Hazel and Stewart, 2020). In particular, the Thwaites  and  Pine Island Glacier ice 
shelves could potentially disintegrate this century, which might trigger MICI before 2100 (DeConto and 
Pollard, 2016; DeConto et al., 2021). MISI could potentially develop earlier and faster than simulated by the 
majority of models if fast flowing ice streams follow plastic, instead of currently assumed more viscous, 
sliding laws (Sun et al., 2020). Oceanic feedbacks could drive high-end sea-level rise by changes in the 
meltwater-driven overturning circulation in ice cavities that cause additional melting (Jeong et al., 2020); by 
a warming of the ocean water in contact with the ice shelves due to increased stratification and thus reduced 
vertical mixing (Sections 9.2.2.3, 9.2.3.2) (Golledge et al., 2019b; Moorman et al., 2020; Sadai et al., 2020); 
or by an increase in sea-ice cover due to increased ocean stratification (Section 9.3.2.1), which could reduce 
the amount of warm, moist air that reaches the continent and limit the mass gain from snowfall over the ice 
sheet (Sadai et al., 2020).  </p>

<p>In Greenland, stronger mass loss than currently projected might also occur (Aschwanden et al., 2019; Khan 
et al., 2020; Slater et al., 2020b). For example, warming-induced dynamical changes in atmospheric 
circulation could enhance summer blocking and produce more frequent extreme melt events over Greenland 
similar to the record mass loss of more than 500 Gt in summer 2019 (Section 9.4.1.1) (Delhasse et al., 2018; 
Sasgen et al., 2020). Cloud processes in polar areas that are not well represented in models could further 
enhance surface melt (Hofer et al., 2019), as could feedbacks between surface melt and the increasing albedo 
from meltwater, detritus and pigmented algae (Section 9.4.1.1) (Cook et al., 2020). The same ice dynamical 
processes associated with basal melt and MISI discussed for Antarctica could also occur in Greenland as 
long as the ice sheet is in contact with the ocean.  </p>

<p>The strength of all these processes is currently understood to depend strongly on global mean temperature 
and polar amplification, with additional linkages through feedback from global mean sea-level (Gomez et al., 
2020). These dependencies on a joint forcing imply that processes are strongly correlated. Hence, both their 
uncertainties and their possible cascading contribution to high-end sea-level rise are expected to combine. 
High-end sea-level rise can therefore occur if one or two processes related to ice-sheet collapse in Antarctica 
result in an additional sea-level rise at the maximum of their plausible ranges (Sections 9.4.2.5, 9.6.3.3; 
Table 9.7) or if several of the processes described in this box result in individual contributions to additional 
sea-level rise at moderate levels. In both cases, global-mean sea-level rise by 2100 would be substantially 
higher than the assessed likely range, as indicated by the projections including low confidence processes 
reaching in 2100 as high as 1.6 m at the 83rd percentile and 2.3 m at the 95th percentile (Section 9.6.3.3). </p>

<p>Identifying the potential drivers of a high-end sea-level rise allows identification of sites and observables that 
can provide early warnings of a much faster sea-level rise than the likely range of this and previous reports. 
One potential site for such monitoring is Thwaites Glacier, which is melting faster in some places and slower 
in others than models simulate. At this glacier, the effect of tides and channelling of warm water flows on the 
melting is evident (Milillo et al., 2019), making the floating ice shelf potentially vulnerable to breakup from 
hydrofracturing, driven by surface meltwater, much earlier than expected. In addition, the glacier is 
retreating towards a zone with deeper bedrock, which at its present rate of retreat would be reached in 30 
years (Yu et al., 2019). Thwaites Glacier is therefore a strong candidate to experience large-scale MISI 
and/or MICI (Golledge et al., 2019b; DeConto et al., 2021), making it the ideal site for monitoring early-
warning signals of accelerated sea-level-rise from Antarctica. Such signals could possibly be observed within 
the next few decades (Scambos et al., 2017). </p>
