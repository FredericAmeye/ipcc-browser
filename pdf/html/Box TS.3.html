<p>Future global warming exceeding the assessed very likely range cannot be ruled out and is potentially 
associated with the highest risks for society and ecosystems. Such low-likelihood, high-warming storylines 
tend to exhibit substantially greater changes in the intensity of regional drying and wetting than the multi-
model mean. Even at levels of warming within the very likely range, global and regional low-likelihood 
outcomes might occur, such as large precipitation changes, additional sea level rise associated with 
collapsing ice sheets, or abrupt ocean circulation changes. While there is medium confidence that the Atlantic 
Meridional Overturning circulation (AMOC) will not experience an abrupt collapse before 2100, if it were to 
occur, it would very likely cause abrupt shifts in regional weather patterns and water cycle. The probability 
of these low-likelihood outcomes increases with higher global warming levels. If the real-world climate 
sensitivity lies at the high end of the assessed range, then global and regional changes substantially outside 
the very likely range projections occur for a given emissions scenario. With increasing global warming, some 
very rare extremes and some compound events (multivariate or concurrent extremes) with low likelihood in 
past and current climate will become more frequent, and there is a higher chance that events unprecedented 
in the observational record occur (high confidence). Finally, low likelihood, high-impact outcomes may also 
arise from a series of very large volcanic eruptions that could substantially alter the 21st century climate 
trajectory compared to SSP-based Earth system model projections. {Cross-Chapter Box 4.1, 4.3, 4.4, 4.8, 
7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 8.6, 9.2, 9.6, Box TS.4, Box 9.4, Box 11.2, CCB 12.1}  </p>

<p>Previous IPCC reports largely focused their assessment on the projected very likely range of future surface 
warming and associated climate change. However, a comprehensive risk assessment also requires 
considering the potentially larger changes in the physical climate system that are unlikely or very unlikely but 
possible and potentially associated with the highest risks for society and ecosystems (Figure TS.6). Since 
AR5, the development of physical climate storylines of high warming has emerged as a useful approach for 
exploring the future risk space that lies outside of the IPCC very likely range projections. {4.8} </p>

<p>Uncertainty in the true values of equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and transient climate response (TCR) 
dominate uncertainty in projections of future warming under moderate to strong emissions scenarios 
(TS.3.2). A real-world ECS higher than the assessed very likely range (2°C–5°C) would require a strong 
historical aerosol cooling and/or a trend towards stronger warming from positive feedbacks linked to changes 
in SST patterns (pattern effects), combined with a strong positive cloud feedback and substantial biases in 
paleoclimate reconstructions – each of which is assessed as either unlikely or very unlikely, but not ruled out. 
Since CMIP6 contains several ESMs that exceed the upper bound of the assessed very likely range in future 
surface warming, these models can be used to develop low-likelihood, high warming storylines to explore 
risks and vulnerabilities, even in the absence of a quantitative assessment of likelihood. {4.3.4, 4.8, 7.3.2, 
7.4.4, 7.5.2, 7.5.5, 7.5.7}  </p>

<p>CMIP6 models with surface warming outside, or close to, the upper bound of the very likely range exhibit 
patterns of large widespread temperature and precipitation changes that differ substantially from the multi-
model mean in all scenarios. For SSP5-8.5, the high-warming models exhibit widespread warming of more 
than 6°C over most extratropical land regions and parts of the Amazon. In the Arctic, annual mean 
temperatures increase by more than 10°C relative to present-day, corresponding to about 30% more than the 
best estimate of warming. Even for SSP1-2.6, high-warming models show on average 2°C–3°C warming 
relative to present-day conditions over much of Eurasia and North America (about 40% more than the best 
estimate of warming) and more than 4°C warming relative to the present over the Arctic (Box TS.3, Figure 
1) in 2081–2100. Such a high global warming storyline would imply that the remaining carbon budget 
consistent with a 2°C warming is smaller than the assessed very likely range. Put another way, even if a 
carbon budget that likely limits warming to 2°C is met, a low-likelihood, high-warming storyline would 
result in warming of 2.5°C or more. {4.8} </p>

<p>CMIP6 models with global warming close to the upper bound of the assessed very likely warming range tend 
to exhibit greater changes in the intensity of regional drying and wetting than the multi-model mean. 
Furthermore, these model projections show a larger area of drying and tend to show a larger fraction of 
strong precipitation increases than the multi-model mean. However, regional precipitation changes arise 
from both thermodynamic and dynamic processes so that the most pronounced global warming levels are not 
necessarily associated with the strongest precipitation response. Abrupt human-caused changes to the water 
cycle cannot be ruled out. Positive land surface feedbacks, involving vegetation and dust, can contribute to 
abrupt changes in aridity, but there is only low confidence that such changes will occur during the 21st 
century. Continued Amazon deforestation, combined with a warming climate, raises the probability that this 
ecosystem will cross a tipping point into a dry state during the 21st century (low confidence). {4.8, 8.6.2, 
Box TS.9}  </p>

<p>While there is medium confidence that the projected decline in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning 
Circulation (AMOC) (TS.2.4) will not involve an abrupt collapse before 2100, such a collapse might be 
triggered by an unexpected meltwater influx from the Greenland Ice Sheet. If an AMOC collapse were to 
occur, it would very likely cause abrupt shifts in the weather patterns and water cycle, such as a southward 
shift in the tropical rain belt, and could result in weakening of the African and Asian monsoons and 
strengthening of Southern Hemisphere monsoons. {4.7.2, 8.6.1, 9.2.3, Box TS.9, Box TS.13} </p>

<p>Very rare extremes and compound or concurrent events, such as the 2018 concurrent heatwaves across the 
Northern Hemisphere, are often associated with large impacts. The changing climate state is already altering 
the likelihood of extreme events, such as decadal droughts and extreme sea levels, and will continue to do so 
under future warming. Compound events and concurrent extremes contribute to increasing probability of 
low-likelihood, high-impact outcomes, and will become more frequent with increasing global warming (high 
confidence). Higher warming levels increase the likelihood of events unprecedented in the observational 
record. {Box 11.2, 9.6.4} </p>

<p>Finally, low likelihood storylines need not necessarily relate solely to the human-induced changes in climate. 
A low-likelihood, high-impact outcome, consistent with historical precedent in the past 2,500 years, would 
be to see several large volcanic eruptions that could greatly alter the 21st century climate trajectory 
compared to SSP-based Earth system model projections. {Cross-Chapter Box 4.1} </p>
