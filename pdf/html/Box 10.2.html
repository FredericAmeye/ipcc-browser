<p>Communicating the full extent of available information on future climate for a region, including an 
uncertainty quantification, can act as a barrier to the uptake and use of such information (Lemos et al., 2012; 
Daron et al., 2018). To address the need to simplify and increase the relevance of information for specific 
contexts, recent studies have adopted storyline and narrative approaches (Hazeleger et al., 2015; Shepherd et 
al., 2018; Section 1.4.4.2). As such, these approaches are an important tool for the climate information 
distillation (Section 10.5.3). Here we assess these in a regional climate information context, namely for 
exploring uncertainties, embedding climate information into a given user context, and communicating 
climate change information. </p>

<p>Physical climate storylines are self-consistent and plausible unfoldings of a physical trajectory of the climate 
system, or a weather or climate event, on time scales from hours to multiple decades (Section 1.4.4.2). 
Storylines that condition climatic features and processes on a set of plausible but distinct large-scale climatic 
changes enables the exploration of uncertainties in regional climate projections (Box 10.2, Figure 1; Section 
10.3.4.2). For instance, Zappa and Shepherd (2017) condition projected changes in European surface wind 
speeds on different plausible projections of tropical upper tropospheric warming and the polar vortex 
strength in the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble. Storylines of specific events are generated to explore the 
unfolding and impacts of comparable events in counterfactual climates (Lackmann, 2015; Meredith et al., 
2015b; Takayabu et al., 2015; Hegdahl et al., 2020; Sillmann et al., 2020). Those event storylines can be 
based on pseudo-global warming studies (Lackmann, 2015; Meredith et al., 2015; Takayabu et al., 2015; 
Section 10.3.2.2), selected and possibly downscaled events from long-term climate projections (Hegdahl et 
al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020a), or based on expert judgment of plausible changes to observed events (Pisaric 
et al., 2011; Dessai et al., 2018). They can be used for attributing events to different causal factors 
(Lackmann, 2015; Meredith et al., 2015; Takayabu et al., 2015; Trenberth et al., 2015; Shepherd, 2016; 
Section 11.2.4) as well as for exploring the unfolding of events in future climates. </p>

<p>Physical climate storylines are complementary to probabilistic or unconditional risk-based approaches, and 
are particularly suitable to explore low-likelihood changes or events, which are often associated with the 
highest impacts (Shepherd et al., 2018; Sillmann et al., 2020; Section 4.8). They also facilitate providing 
local context to large-scale trends and changes, by conditioning the projections on locally relevant 
circumstances (Hazeleger et al., 2015). Storylines are also developed based on expert elicitation and include 
plausible changes beyond those simulated by existing model projections in order to explore deep 
uncertainties (Dessai et al., 2018). </p>

<p>Storylines can be combined with impact modelling (Strasser et al., 2019; Hegdahl et al., 2020) and can be 
embedded in a user’s risk landscape (Shepherd, 2019; Box 10.2, Figure 1). This holds in particular for event 
storylines, where confounding factors such as regional characteristics like land-use changes and non-climatic 
drivers of the event are an element of the storyline (Pisaric et al., 2011; Dessai et al., 2018; Lloyd and 
Shepherd, 2020; Sillmann et al., 2020). In a co-production process, multi-disciplinary expert knowledge as 
well as the values and interests of the intended audiences and stakeholders can be explicitly considered (Kok 
et al., 2014; Bhave et al., 2018; Dessai et al., 2018; Scott et al., 2018; Hegdahl et al., 2020). </p>

<p>Storylines can also be used to communicate climate information by narrative elements describing the main 
climatological features and the relevant consequences in the user context (Fløttum and Gjerstad, 2017; 
Moezzi et al., 2017; Dessai et al., 2018; Scott et al., 2018; Jack et al., 2020). Co-produced narratives have 
been demonstrated to enhance knowledge integration in decision-making contexts (e.g., de Bruijn et al., 
2016). Narrative elements have also been employed to convey information from climate models (Corballis, 
2019). Jack et al. (2020) introduced the concept of climate risk narratives and developed a set of principles, 
such as using present tense in their presentation to avoid effects of future discounting, and writing individual 
narratives without uncertainty language to assume an imagined observer perspective. From this point of 
view, event storylines are particularly useful for communication purposes as they link to the experience and 
episodic memory of stakeholders (Schacter et al., 2007; Steynor et al., 2016; Shepherd et al., 2018). </p>
