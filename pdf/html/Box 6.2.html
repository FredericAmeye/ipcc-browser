<p>Striving to achieve air quality and climate targets will bring significant SLCFs reductions. These reductions 
contribute first and foremost to attainment of SDGs targeting improved human health and sustainable cities 
(SDG 3 and 11), specifically related to PM exposure (goals 3.9 and 11.6) (Lelieveld, 2017; Amann et al., 
2020) but also access to affordable and clean energy, responsible consumption and production, climate, as 
well as reducing nutrient losses and consequently protect biodiversity (SDG 7, 12, 13, 14, and 15) (UNEP, 
2019; Amann et al., 2020). Furthermore, declining SLCF emissions will result in reduced crop losses (SDG 
2; zero hunger) due to decrease of ozone exposure (Feng and Kobayashi, 2009; Ainsworth et al., 2012; 
Emberson et al., 2018).   </p>

<p>However, the design of suitable policies addressing these SDGs can be difficult because of the complexity 
linking emissions to impacts on human health, ecosystem, equity, infrastructure, and costs. Beyond the fact 
that several species are co-emitted, interlinkage between species, for example through atmospheric 
chemistry, can weaken the benefit of emissions reduction efforts. An illustration lies in the recent (2013-
2017) reduction of aerosols over China (Silver et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2018b) resulting from the strategy to 
improve air quality (“Clean Air Action”), has successfully reduced the level of PM2.5 but has led to a 
concurrent increase in surface ozone, partly due to declining heterogeneous interactions of O3 precursors 
with aerosols (Li et al., 2019a; Yu et al., 2019). This side effect on ozone has been addressed since then by amending the legislation to target NMVOC sources, especially solvent use. Complex interactions between 
anthropogenic and biogenic vapours are also at play and reduction of certain SLCFs could possibly promote 
new particle formation from organic vapours (e.g., Lehtipalo et al., 2018). Finally, a recent example of this 
complexity is the mixed effects on ozone pollution induced by NOx decrease during the COVID-19 
pandemic (see Cross-Chapter Box 6.1). Thus, the climate and air pollution effects of policies depend 
strongly on choice of regulated compounds and the degree of reduction. Such policies have to be informed 
by strong science support, including for example multi-model analyses, e.g., HTAP (UNECE, 2010), AMAP 
(AMAP, 2015a, 2015b), based on global and regional CCMs, essential to capture the complexity and inform 
the policy development process. 
In addition, pursuing SDG objectives, apparently decoupled from air pollution, such as improved waste 
management, access to clean energy, or improved agricultural practices, would also stimulate and lead to 
mitigation of SLCFs (Box 6.2, Figure 1). Amann et al. (2020) shows that a global strategy to achieve the 
WHO air quality guidelines, cannot only rely on air pollution control but also on a combination of SDG 
aligned policies. Such actions would include energy efficiency improvements, increased use of renewables, 
reduction of CH4 from waste management and agriculture, and CO2 and CH4 due to lower fossil fuel 
consumption, resulting in climate co-benefits. Consideration of SDGs including local air quality co-benefits, 
creates an opportunity to support and gain acceptance for ambitious climate mitigation (Jakob and Steckel, 
2016; Stechow et al., 2016; Vandyck et al., 2018). Such near-term policies targeting SDGs and air quality 
would enable longer term transformations necessary to achieve climate goals (Chapter 17, WGIII). </p>
