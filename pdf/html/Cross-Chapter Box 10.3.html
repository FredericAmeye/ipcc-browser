<p>This Cross-Chapter Box illustrates how assessments of past, present and future regional climate changes 
(e.g., change in an extreme event index or Climatic Impact-Driver, CID) are derived in the WGI report. 
Robust assessments can be derived when changes are supported by multiple lines of evidence. </p>

<p>Multiple, sometimes contrasting, lines of evidence are derived from the various data sources, methodologies 
and approaches that can be used to construct climate information (Figure 10.1, Section 10.5). Such data 
sources and methodologies include theoretical understanding of relevant processes, drivers and feedbacks of 
climate at regional scale, observed data from multiple datasets (e.g., ground station networks, satellite 
products, reanalysis, etc.), simulations from different model types (including GCMs, RCMs, statistical 
downscaling methods, etc.) and experiments (e.g., CMIP5 and 6, CORDEX, and Single-Model Initial-
condition Large Ensembles), methodologies to attribute observed changes or events to large- and regional-
scale anthropogenic and natural drivers and forcings as well as other relevant local knowledge (e.g., 
indigenous knowledge). </p>

<p>The assessment is derived following the IPCC uncertainty guidance through a distillation process of multiple 
lines of evidence on observed trends, attribution of trends or events, climate model projections and physical 
understanding, covered in several chapters of the WGI report. </p>

<p>In particular, this Cross-Chapter Box explains the methodology used to derive the regional assessments 
summarised in the Technical Summary (TS) table that are, in turn, used as a basis for the synthesis 
assessment in the Summary for Policymakers (SPM). </p>

<p><figref>Cross-Chapter Box 10.3,Figure1</figref> </p>

<p>The process consists of three discrete steps, listed below and schematically illustrated in Cross-Chapter Box 10.3, Figure 1: </p>

<h3>1) Collection and assessment of the fitness for purpose of available information</h3>

<p>Any specific climate change that is regionally relevant is assessed looking at lines of evidence, potentially 
across multiple indices. For example, several definitions of “drought” exist that refer to a variety of the 
underlying processes, temporal and spatial scales, as well as sectoral applications and associated impacts 
(Sections 11.6, 12.3). Such diverse definitions need to be gathered from the relevant literature, compared, 
and individually assessed if appropriate. </p>

<p>Once the indices of change are properly defined, the relevant climate information is collated from the 
available sources. </p>

<p>The information is then evaluated against its fitness for purpose, i.e., whether it is adequate to provide robust 
evidence to derive an assessment. In the case of observed data, issues to be considered include (but are not 
limited to): spatial and temporal resolution, accuracy, gaps in the recorded data, homogeneity in the station 
network, uncertainty treatment, etc. (Sections 10.2, 11.2, 11.9, 12.4, Atlas.1.4). In case of modeled data, an 
assessment of the fitness for purpose typically includes an evaluation of numerical or statistical methods 
adopted, adequate representation of the physical processes, forcings and feedbacks relevant for the region 
and the change under consideration, the availability of adequate ensembles to assess the interplay between 
forced response and internal variability and the uncertainty in future projections (Sections 10.3, 10.4, 11.2, 
11.9, 12.4 and Chapter Atlas). Attribution assessments are usually based on models and observations for 
which the fitness for purpose is assessed with similar criteria as those described above (Cross-Working 
Group Box: Attribution (in Chapter 1)). The assessment is made either directly or indirectly by scrutinizing 
the data and methods of the relevant literature against the criteria listed above. </p>

<h3>2) Assessment of confidence of the multiple lines of evidence</h3>

<p>Once the relevant information has been collated for a given regional change, an assessment of the confidence 
is first made for each line of evidence separately. The assessment of confidence is the result of expert 
judgment drawing around a set of questions such as: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Do we have a physical explanation of the processes responsible for past and future changes in the 
region?  </p></li>
<li><p>Do observed trends agree amongst different observational products/datasets? Are they statistically 
significant? Do the observations cover the same temporal period and/or spatial area? Are the 
observations homogeneous in time? </p></li>
<li><p>Can past trends be attributed to human activities (GHGs, SLCFs or land use/management changes)? 
Are attributed trends and events consistent? What is the interplay between internal variability and 
forced response?  </p></li>
<li><p>Do model projections agree on the magnitude and sign of the projected signal? Are we able to 
understand the reasons underlying any discrepancies? Can we quantify the uncertainty in the 
projected signal? Are the projections based on similar SSP-RCP/time horizon or GWL (Cross-
Chapter Box 11.1)? If not, are they comparable?  </p></li>
<li><p>Has the signal already emerged? Are there studies indicating the time of emergence of the signal?  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>The assessment is then tested for overall coherence across the available lines of evidence, for example: 
- Are observed historical changes consistent with future projections? 
- Are attributed events similar to the types of changes projected for the future? 
- Is there a physical explanation for changes that are projected but have not yet been clearly observed 
or attributed? 
- Are assessments of confidence and likelihood performed in a similar way across regions? </p>

<h3>3) Distillation of regional information and synthesis of the independent assessments</h3>

<p>To ensure transparency, a traceback matrix is constructed (refer to 10.SM) that, for each region and index, 
identifies where in the chapters the relevant information can be found, together with a summary of the 
relevant information in the Technical Summary. </p>

<p>Based on assessments mainly in Chapters 8, 9 11, 12 and Atlas, the table in Technical Summary TS.4.3.1 
collates, by means of colours and symbols, the assessment of the confidence in past trend, attribution and 
direction of future change. This distillation process is illustrated below with two examples: (1) a relatively 
simple case for the assessment of extreme heat over Southeast South America, where most of the lines of 
evidence agree, and (2) ecological, agricultural and hydrological drought  in the Mediterranean, which is 
more complex due to the different definitions of ‘drought’ and the sometimes conflicting information arising 
from different lines of evidence and the example shown here is preceded by the decision to focus on these 
types of drought rather than, e.g., meteorological drought. </p>

<h4>a) Extreme heat in southeastern South America (SES)</h4>

<p><em>Observed past trends</em> <br />
Mean temperature and extreme maximum and minimum temperatures have shown an increasing trend (high 
confidence). An increase in the intensity and in the frequency of heatwave events between 1961 and 2014 is 
also observed. However, there is medium confidence that warm extremes have decreased in the last decades 
over the central region of SES during austral summer (Sections Atlas.7.2.2 and 11.9). </p>

<p>There is evidence of increasing heat stress during summertime in much of SES for the period 1973-2012 
(Section 12.4.4.1). </p>

<p><em>Attribution</em> <br />
Based on trend detection and attribution studies of maximum and minimum temperatures and event 
attribution of heat waves in the region, there is high confidence in a human contribution to the observed 
increase in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes (Section 11.9). </p>

<p>The increasing heat stress over summertime in much of SES has been attributed to human influence on the 
climate system (Section 12.4.4.1). </p>

<p><em>Projections</em> <br />
There is high confidence that by the end of century most regions in South America will undergo extreme heat 
stress conditions much more often than in the recent past, with about 50-100 more days per year under SSP1-
2.6 and more than 200 additional days per year under SSP5-8.5 (high confidence) (Section 12.4.4.1). </p>

<p>Based on different lines of evidence (GCMs, RCMs) an increase in the intensity and frequency of hot 
extremes is extremely likely for SES at all assessed warming levels (compared with pre-industrial) (Section 
11.9). </p>

<p><em>Synthesized assessment in the Technical Summary from multiple lines of evidence</em> <br />
There is high confidence that extreme temperatures have increased over SES over the last decades and that 
human influence likely contributed to the observed changes in extreme temperatures. An increase in the 
frequency and intensity of heatwave events has been observed. Most land regions will frequently undergo 
extreme heat stress conditions by the end of the 21st century, with an increase in the frequency of heatwaves 
and heat stress conditions (Technical Summary TS.4.3.2). </p>

<h4>b) Mediterranean ecological, agricultural and hydrological droughts</h4>

<p><em>Observed past trends</em> <br />
Hydrological modelling suggests that the recent decline in soil moisture in the Mediterranean is 
unprecedented in the last 250 years. Paleoclimate evidence extends this view, additionally indicating that 
dryness in the Mediterranean is approaching an extreme condition compared to the last millennium (Section 
8.3.1.6). </p>

<p>There is an increase in probability and intensity of agricultural and ecological droughts (medium confidence) 
and there is an increase in frequency and severity of hydrological droughts (high confidence) (Section 11.9). </p>

<p><em>Attribution</em> <br />
Global warming has contributed to drying in dry summer climates including the Mediterranean (high 
confidence). Records of soil moisture indicate that higher temperatures and increased atmospheric demand 
have played a strong role in driving Mediterranean aridity. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that 
anthropogenic forcings are causing increased aridity and drought severity in the Mediterranean region (high 
confidence) (Section 8.3.1.6). </p>

<p>An increasing trend towards agricultural and ecological droughts has been attributed to human-induced 
climate change in the Mediterranean (medium confidence). Model-based assessment shows with medium 
confidence a human fingerprint on increased hydrological drought, related to rising temperature and 
atmospheric demand, and frequency and intensity of recent drought events. There is medium confidence that 
change in land use and terrestrial water management contribute to trends in hydrological drought (Section 
11.9). </p>

<p><em>Projections</em> <br />
There is high confidence that drought severity and intensity will increase in the Mediterranean. Increased 
evapotranspiration due to growing atmospheric water demand will decrease soil moisture (high confidence). 
The seasonality of runoff and streamflow (the annual difference between the wettest and driest months of the 
year) is expected to increase with global warming (high confidence). Annual runoff is very likely to 
decrease. Under middle or high emissions scenarios, the likelihood of extreme droughts increases by 200–
300% in the Mediterranean. The paleoclimate record provides context for these future expected changes: 
climate change will shift soil moisture outside the range of observed and reconstructed values spanning the 
last millennium (high confidence) (Sections 8.4.1.5 and 8.4.1.6).  </p>

<p>There is medium confidence in the increase of agricultural and ecological drought at +1.5ºC, high confidence 
at +2ºC and very likely at +4ºC, with large decreases in soil water availability during drought events and 
increase in drought magnitude. There is medium confidence in the increase in hydrological drought at 
+1.5ºC, high confidence at +2ºC and very likely at +4ºC with very strong decrease (40-60%) of total runoff in 
the spring-summer half-year and a 50-60% increase in frequency of days under low flow (Section 11.9). </p>

<p>There is high confidence that agricultural, ecological and hydrological droughts will increase in the 
Mediterranean region by mid and far end of century under all RCPs (except RCP2.6/SSP1-2.6), or for GWLs 
equal to or higher than 2ºC (Section 12.4.5.2). </p>

<p><em>Synthesized assessment in the Technical Summary from multiple lines of evidence</em> <br />
There is high confidence that hydrological droughts have increased in the Mediterranean since the 1960s 
related to rising temperature and atmospheric demand, and medium confidence of a human fingerprint on this 
increase. There is medium confidence in the increase of ecological and agricultural droughts and in their 
attribution to human-induced climate change. There is high confidence of an increase in ecological, 
agricultural and hydrological droughts for warming levels exceeding 2°C, and medium confidence of an 
increase for lower warming levels (Technical Summary TS4.3.2). </p>
