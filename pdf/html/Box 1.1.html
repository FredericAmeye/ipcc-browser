<p>The AR6 follows the approach developed for AR5 (Box 1.1, Figure 1), as described in the ‘Guidance Notes 
for Lead Authors of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report on Consistent Treatment of Uncertainties’ 
(Mastrandrea et al., 2010). The uncertainty Guidance Note used in AR6 clarifies the relationship between the 
qualitative description of confidence and the quantitative representation of uncertainty expressed by the 
likelihood scale. The calibrated uncertainty language emphasizes traceability of the assessment throughout 
the process. Key chapter findings presented in the chapter Executive Summary are supported in the chapter 
text by a summary of the underlying literature that is assessed in terms of evidence and agreement, 
confidence, and also likelihood if applicable.  </p>

<p>In all three WGs, author teams evaluate underlying scientific understanding and use two metrics to 
communicate the degree of certainty in key findings. These metrics are: </p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>Confidence:</em> a qualitative measure of the validity of a finding, based on the type, amount, quality and 
consistency of evidence (e.g., data, mechanistic understanding, theory, models, expert judgment) and 
the degree of agreement. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Likelihood:</em> a quantitative measure of uncertainty in a finding, expressed probabilistically (e.g., 
based on statistical analysis of observations or model results, or both, and expert judgement by the 
author team or from a formal quantitative survey of expert views, or both).  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Throughout IPCC reports, the calibrated language indicating a formal confidence assessment is clearly 
identified by italics (e.g., medium confidence). Where appropriate, findings can also be formulated as 
statements of fact without uncertainty qualifiers.  </p>

<p><figref>Box 1.1,Figure1</boxref> </p>

<p>Figure 1 (adapted from Mach et al., 2017) shows the idealized step-by-step process by which IPCC 
authors assess scientific understanding and uncertainties. It starts with the evaluation of the available 
evidence and agreement (Steps 1–2). The following summary terms are used to describe the available 
evidence: limited, medium, or robust; and the degree of agreement: low, medium, or high. Generally, 
evidence is most robust when there are multiple, consistent, independent lines of high-quality evidence. </p>

<p>If the author team concludes that there is sufficient evidence and agreement, the level of confidence can be 
evaluated. In this step, assessments of evidence and agreement are combined into a single metric (Steps 3–5). 
The assessed level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high, and very 
high. Step 4 depicts how summary statements for evidence and agreement relate to confidence levels. For a 
given evidence and agreement statement, different confidence levels can be assigned depending on the 
context, but increasing levels of evidence and degrees of agreement correlate with increasing confidence. 
When confidence in a finding is assessed to be low, this does not necessarily mean that confidence in its 
opposite is high, and vice versa. Similarly, low confidence does not imply distrust in the finding; instead, it 
means that the statement is the best conclusion based on currently available knowledge. Further research and 
methodological progress may change the level of confidence in any finding in future assessments. </p>

<p>If the expert judgement of the author team concludes that there is sufficient confidence and 
quantitative/probabilistic evidence, assessment conclusions can be expressed with likelihood statements 
(Box.1.1, Figure 1, Steps 5–6). Unless otherwise indicated, likelihood statements are related to findings for 
which the authors’ assessment of confidence is ‘high’ or ‘very high’. Terms used to indicate the assessed 
likelihood of an outcome include: virtually certain: 99–100% probability, very likely: 90–100%, likely: 66–
100%, about as likely as not: 33–66%, unlikely: 0–33%, very unlikely: 0–10%, exceptionally unlikely: 0–1%. 
Additional terms (extremely likely: 95–100%, more likely than not >50–100%, and extremely unlikely 0–5%) 
may also be used when appropriate.  </p>

<p>Likelihood can indicate probabilities for single events or broader outcomes. The probabilistic information 
may build from statistical or modelling analyses, other quantitative analyses, or expert elicitation. The 
framework encourages authors, where appropriate, to present probability more precisely than can be done 
with the likelihood scale, for example with complete probability distributions or percentile ranges, including 
quantification of tails of distributions important for risk management (Mach et al., 2017; see also Sections 
1.2.2 and 1.4.4). In some instances, multiple combinations of confidence and likelihood are possible to 
characterize key findings. For example, a very likely statement might be made with high confidence, whereas 
a likely statement might be made with very high confidence. In these instances, the author teams consider 
which statement will convey the most balanced information to the reader. </p>

<p>Throughout this WGI report and unless stated otherwise, uncertainty is quantified using 90% uncertainty 
intervals. The 90% uncertainty interval, reported in square brackets [x to y], is estimated to have a 90% 
likelihood of covering the value that is being estimated. The range encompasses the median value and there 
is an estimated 10% combined likelihood of the value being below the lower end of the range (x) and above 
its upper end (y). Often the distribution will be considered symmetric about the corresponding best estimate 
(as in the illustrative example in the figure), but this is not always the case. In this report, an assessed 90% 
uncertainty interval is referred to as a ‘very likely range’. Similarly, an assessed 66% uncertainty interval is 
referred to as a ‘likely range’. </p>
