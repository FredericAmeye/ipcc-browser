# 4.es Executive Summary 

This chapter assesses simulations of future global climate change, spanning time horizons from the near term 
(2021–2040), mid-term (2041–2060), and long term (2081–2100) out to the year 2300. Changes are assessed 
relative to both the recent past (1995–2014) and the 1850–1900 approximation to the pre-industrial period. 

*The projections assessed here are mainly based on a new range of scenarios, the Shared Socio-
economic Pathways (SSPs) used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6).* 
Among the SSPs, the focus is on the five scenarios SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5. 
In the SSP labels, the first number refers to the assumed shared socio-economic pathway, and the second 
refers to the approximate global effective radiative forcing (ERF) in 2100. Where appropriate, this chapter 
also assesses new results from CMIP5, which used scenarios based on Representative Concentration 
Pathways (RCPs). Additional lines of evidence enter the assessment, especially for change in globally 
averaged surface air temperature (GSAT) and global mean sea level (GMSL), while assessment for changes 
in other quantities is mainly based on CMIP6 results. Unless noted otherwise, the assessments assume that 
there will be no major volcanic eruption in the 21st century. {1.6, 4.2.2, 4.3.2, 4.3.4, 4.6.2, BOX 4.1: Cross-
Chapter Box 4.1, Cross-Chapter Box 7.1, 9.6} 

## Temperature 

*Assessed future change in GSAT is, for the first time in an IPCC report, explicitly constructed by 
combining scenario-based projections with observational constraints based on past simulated 
warming, as well as an updated assessment of equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and transient 
climate response (TCR).* Climate forecasts initialized using recent observations have also been used for the 
period 2019–2028. The inclusion of additional lines of evidence has reduced the assessed uncertainty ranges 
for each scenario. {4.3.1, 4.3.4, 4.4.1, 7.5} 

*In the near term (2021–2040), a 1.5°C increase in the 20-year average of GSAT, relative to the average 
over the period 1850–1900, is very likely to occur in scenario SSP5-8.5, likely to occur in scenarios 
SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0, and more likely than not to occur in scenarios SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6.* The 
threshold-crossing time is defined as the midpoint of the first 20-year period during which the average GSAT 
exceeds the threshold. In all scenarios assessed here except SSP5-8.5, the central estimate of crossing the 
1.5°C threshold lies in the early 2030s. This is about ten years earlier than the midpoint of the likely range 
(2030–2052) assessed in the SR1.5, which assumed continuation of the then-current warming rate; this rate 
has been confirmed in the AR6. Roughly half of the ten-year difference between assessed crossing times 
arises from a larger historical warming diagnosed in AR6. The other half arises because for central estimates 
of climate sensitivity, most scenarios show stronger warming over the near term than was assessed as 
‘current’ in SR1.5 (medium confidence). It is more likely than not that under SSP1-1.9, GSAT relative to 
1850–1900 will remain below 1.6°C throughout the 21st century, implying a potential temporary overshoot 
of 1.5°C global warming of no more than 0.1°C. If climate sensitivity lies near the lower end of the assessed 
very likely range, crossing the 1.5°C warming threshold is avoided in scenarios SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 
(medium confidence). {2.3.1, Cross-chapter Box 2.3, 3.3.1, 4.3.4, BOX 4.1:, 7.5} 

*By 2030, GSAT in any individual year could exceed 1.5°C relative to 1850–1900 with a likelihood 
between 40% and 60%, across the scenarios considered here (medium confidence).* Uncertainty in near-
term projections of annual GSAT arises in roughly equal measure from natural internal variability and model 
uncertainty (high confidence). By contrast, near-term annual GSAT levels depend less on the scenario 
chosen, consistent with the AR5 assessment. Forecasts initialized from recent observations simulate annual 
GSAT changes for the period 2019–2028 relative to the recent past that are consistent with the assessed very 
likely range (high confidence). {4.4.1, BOX 4.1:} 

*Compared to the recent past (1995–2014), GSAT averaged over the period 2081–2100 is very likely to 
be higher by 0.2°C–1.0°C in the low-emission scenario SSP1-1.9 and by 2.4°C–4.8°C in the high-
emission scenario SSP5-8.5.* For the scenarios SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP3-7.0, the corresponding very 
likely ranges are 0.5°C–1.5°C, 1.2°C–2.6°C, and 2.0°C–3.7°C, respectively. The uncertainty ranges for the 
period 2081–2100 continue to be dominated by the uncertainty in ECS and TCR (very high confidence). 
Emissions-driven simulations for SSP5-8.5 show that carbon-cycle uncertainty is too small to change the 
assessment of GSAT projections (high confidence). {4.3.1, 4.3.4, 4.6.2, 7.5} 

*The CMIP6 models project a wider range of GSAT change than the assessed range (high confidence); 
furthermore, the CMIP6 GSAT increase tends to be larger than in CMIP5 (very high confidence).*
About half of the increase in simulated warming has occurred because higher climate sensitivity is more 
prevalent in CMIP6 than in CMIP5; the other half arises from higher ERF in nominally comparable 
scenarios (e.g., RCP8.5 and SSP5-8.5; medium confidence). In SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5, ERF changes also 
explain about half of the changes in the range of warming (medium confidence). For SSP5-8.5, higher 
climate sensitivity is the primary reason behind the upper end of the warming being higher than in CMIP5 
(medium confidence). {4.3.1, 4.3.4, 4.6.2, 7.5.6} 

*While high-warming storylines – those associated with GSAT levels above the upper bound of the 
assessed very likely range – are by definition extremely unlikely, they cannot be ruled out. For SSP1-2.6, 
such a high-warming storyline implies long-term (2081–2100) warming well above, rather than well 
below, 2°C (high confidence).* Irrespective of scenario, high-warming storylines imply changes in many 
aspects of the climate system that exceed the patterns associated with the central estimate of GSAT changes 
by up to more than 50% (high confidence). {4.3.4, 4.8} 

*It is virtually certain that the average surface warming will continue to be higher over land than over 
the ocean and that the surface warming in the Arctic will continue to be more pronounced than the 
global average over the 21st century.* The warming pattern likely varies across seasons, with northern high 
latitudes warming more during boreal winter than summer (medium confidence). Regions with increasing or 
decreasing year-to-year variability of seasonal mean temperatures will likely increase in their spatial extent. 
{4.3.1, 4.5.1, 7.4.4} 

*It is very likely that long-term lower-tropospheric warming will be larger in the Arctic than in the 
global mean.* It is very likely that global mean stratospheric cooling will be larger by the end of the 21st 
century in a pathway with higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations. It is likely that tropical upper tropospheric 
warming will be larger than at the tropical surface, but with an uncertain magnitude owing to the effects of 
natural internal variability and uncertainty in the response of the climate system to anthropogenic forcing. 
{4.5.1, 3.3.1.2} 

## Precipitation 

*Annual global land precipitation will increase over the 21st century as GSAT increases (high 
confidence). The likely range of change in globally averaged annual land precipitation during 2081–
2100 relative to 1995–2014 is –0.2–4.7% in the low-emission scenario SSP1-1.9 and 0.9–12.9% in the 
high-emission scenario SSP5-8.5, based on all available CMIP6 models.* The corresponding likely ranges 
are 0.0–6.6% in SSP1-2.6, 1.5–8.3% in SSP2-4.5, and 0.5–9.6% in SSP3-7.0. {4.3.1, 4.5.1, 4.6.1, 8.4.1} 

*Precipitation change will exhibit substantial regional differences and seasonal contrast as GSAT 
increases over the 21st century (high confidence).* As warming increases, a larger land area will experience 
statistically significant increases or decreases in precipitation (medium confidence). Precipitation will very 
likely increase over high latitudes and the tropical oceans, and likely increase in large parts of the monsoon 
region, but likely decrease over large parts of the subtropics in response to greenhouse gas-induced warming. 
Interannual variability of precipitation over many land regions will increase with global warming (medium 
confidence). {4.5.1, 4.6.1, 8.4.1} 

*Near-term projected changes in precipitation are uncertain, mainly because of natural internal 
variability, model uncertainty, and uncertainty in natural and anthropogenic aerosol forcing (medium 
confidence).* In the near term, no discernible differences in precipitation changes are projected between 
different SSPs (high confidence). The anthropogenic aerosol forcing decreases in most scenarios, 
contributing to increases in GSAT (medium confidence) and global-mean land precipitation (low 
confidence).  {4.3.1, 4.4.1, 4.4.4, 8.5} 
 
*In response to greenhouse gas-induced warming, it is likely that global land monsoon precipitation will 
increase, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, although Northern Hemisphere monsoon 
circulation will likely weaken.* In the long term (2081–2100), monsoon rainfall change will feature a north–
south asymmetry characterized by a greater increase in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern 
Hemisphere and an east–west asymmetry characterized by an increase in Asian-African monsoon regions 
and a decrease in the North American monsoon region (medium confidence). Near-term changes in global 
monsoon precipitation and circulation are uncertain due to model uncertainty and internal variability such as 
Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability and Pacific Decadal Variability (medium confidence). {4.4.1, 4.5.1, 8.4.1, 
10.6.3} 
 
*It is likely that at least one large volcanic eruption will occur during the 21st century. Such an eruption 
would reduce GSAT for several years, decrease global-mean land precipitation, alter monsoon 
circulation, modify extreme precipitation, and change the profile of many regional climatic impact-
drivers.* A low-likelihood, high-impact outcome would be several large eruptions that would greatly alter the 
21st century climate trajectory compared to SSP-based Earth system model projections. {Cross-Chapter Box 
4.1} 
 
## Large-scale Circulation and Modes of Variability 
 
*In the near term, the forced change in Southern Annular Mode in austral summer is likely to be 
weaker than observed during the late 20th century under all five SSPs assessed.* This is because of the 
opposing influence in the near- to mid-term from stratospheric ozone recovery and increases in other 
greenhouse gases on the Southern Hemisphere summertime mid-latitude circulation (high confidence). In the 
near term, forced changes in the Southern Annular Mode in austral summer are therefore likely to be smaller 
than changes due to natural internal variability. {4.3.3, 4.4.3} 
 
*In the long term, the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude jet is likely to shift poleward and strengthen 
under SSP5-8.5 relative to 1995–2014.* This is likely to be accompanied by an increase in the Southern 
Annular Mode index in all seasons relative to 1995–2014. For SSP1-2.6, CMIP6 models project no robust 
change in the Southern Annular Mode index in the long term. It is likely that wind speeds associated with 
extratropical cyclones will strengthen in the Southern Hemisphere storm track for SSP5-8.5. {4.5.1, 4.5.3} 
 
*The CMIP6 multi-model ensemble projects a long-term increase in the boreal wintertime Northern 
Annular Mode index under the high-emission scenarios of SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, but regional 
changes may deviate from a simple shift in the mid-latitude circulation.* Substantial uncertainty and thus 
low confidence remain in projecting regional changes in Northern Hemisphere jet streams and storm tracks, 
especially for the North Atlantic basin in winter; this is due to large natural internal variability, the competing 
effects of projected upper- and lower-tropospheric temperature gradient changes, and new evidence of 
weaknesses in simulating past variations in North Atlantic atmospheric circulation on seasonal-to-decadal 
timescales. One exception is the expected decrease in frequency of atmospheric blocking events over 
Greenland and the North Pacific in boreal winter in SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios (medium confidence). 
{4.5.1} 
 
*Near-term predictions and projections of the sub-polar branch of the Atlantic Multi-decadal 
Variability (AMV) on the decadal timescale have improved in CMP6 models compared to CMIP5 
(high confidence).* This is likely to be related to a more accurate response to natural forcing in CMIP6 
models. Initialization contributes to the reduction of uncertainty and to predicting subpolar sea surface 
temperature. AMV influences on the nearby regions can be predicted over lead times of 5–8 years (medium 
confidence). {4.4.3}   
 
*It is virtually certain that the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) will remain the dominant mode of 
interannual variability in a warmer world.* There is no model consensus for a systematic change in 
intensity of ENSO sea surface temperature (SST) variability over the 21st century in any of the SSP 
scenarios assessed (medium confidence). However, it is very likely that ENSO rainfall variability, used for 
defining extreme El Niños and La Niñas, will increase significantly, regardless of amplitude changes in 
ENSO SST variability, by the second half of the 21st century in scenarios SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-
8.5. {4.3.3, 4.5.3, 8.4.2} 
 
## Cryosphere and Ocean 
 
*Under the SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, it is likely that the Arctic Ocean in September, 
the month of annual minimum sea ice area, will become practically ice-free (sea ice area less than 1 
million km2) averaged over 2081–2100 and all available simulations.* Arctic sea ice area in March, the 
month of annual maximum sea ice area, also decreases in the future under each of the considered scenarios, 
but to a much lesser degree (in percentage terms) than in September (high confidence). {4.3.2} 
 
*Under the five scenarios assessed, it is virtually certain that global mean sea level (GMSL) will continue 
to rise through the 21st century.* For the period 2081–2100 relative to 1995–2014, GMSL is likely to rise 
by 0.46–0.74 m under SSP3-7.0 and by 0.30–0.54 m under SSP1-2.6 (medium confidence). For the 
assessment of change in GMSL, the contribution from land-ice melt has been added offline to the CMIP6-
simulated contributions from thermal expansion. {4.3.2. 9.6} 
 
*It is very likely that the cumulative uptake of carbon by the ocean and by land will increase through to 
the end of the 21st century.* Carbon uptake by land shows greater increases but with greater uncertainties 
than for ocean carbon uptake. The fraction of emissions absorbed by land and ocean sinks will be smaller 
under high emission scenarios than under low emission scenarios (high confidence). Ocean surface pH will 
decrease steadily through the 21st century, except for SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 where values decrease until 
around 2070 and then increase slightly to 2100 (high confidence). {4.3.2, 5.4} 
 
## Climate Response to Emission Reduction, Carbon Dioxide Removal, and Solar Radiation Modification 
 
*If strong mitigation is applied from 2020 onward as reflected in SSP1-1.9, its effect on 20-year trends 
in GSAT would likely emerge during the near term (2021–2040), measured against an assumed non-
mitigation scenario such as SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5. However, the response of many other climate 
quantities to mitigation would be largely masked by internal variability during the near term, 
especially on the regional scale (high confidence).* The mitigation benefits for these quantities would 
emerge only later during the 21st century (high confidence). During the near term, a small fraction of the 
surface can show cooling under all scenarios assessed here, so near-term cooling at any given location is 
fully consistent with GSAT increase (high confidence). Events of reduced and increased GSAT trends at 
decadal timescales will continue to occur in the 21st century but will not affect the centennial warming (very 
high confidence). {4.6.3, Cross-Chapter Box 3.1} 
 
*Because of the near-linear relationship between cumulative carbon emissions and GSAT change, the 
cooling or avoided warming from carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is proportional to the cumulative 
amount of CO2 removed by CDR (high confidence).* The climate system response to net negative CO2 
emissions is expected to be delayed by years to centuries. Net negative CO2 emissions due to CDR will not 
reverse some climate change, such as sea level rise, at least for several centuries (high confidence). The 
climate effect of a sudden and sustained CDR termination would depend on the amount of CDR-induced 
cooling prior to termination and the rate of background CO2 emissions at the time of termination (high 
confidence). {4.6.3, 5.5, 5.6} 
 
*Solar radiation modification (SRM) could offset some of the effects of anthropogenic warming on 
global and regional climate, but there would be substantial residual and overcompensating climate 
change at the regional scale and seasonal timescale (high confidence), and there is low confidence in 
our understanding of the climate response to SRM, specifically at the regional scale.* Since the AR5, 
understanding of the global and regional climate response to SRM has improved, due to modelling work 
with more sophisticated treatment of aerosol-based SRM options and stratospheric processes. Improved 
modelling suggests that multiple climate goals could be met simultaneously. A sudden and sustained 
termination of SRM in a high-emission scenario such as SSP5-8.5 would cause a rapid climate change (high 
confidence). However, a gradual phase-out of SRM combined with emissions reductions and CDR would 
more likely than not avoid larger rates of warming. {4.6.3} 

## Climate Change Commitment and Change Beyond 2100 

*Earth system modelling experiments since AR5 confirm that the zero CO2 emissions commitment (the 
additional rise in GSAT after all CO2 emissions cease) is small (likely less than 0.3°C in magnitude) on 
decadal time scales, but that it may be positive or negative.* There is low confidence in the sign of the zero 
CO2 emissions commitment. Consistent with SR1.5, the central estimate is taken as zero for assessments of 
remaining carbon budgets for global warming levels of 1.5°C or 2°C. {4.7.2, 5.5.2}. 

*Overshooting specific global warming levels such as 2°C has effects on the climate system that persist 
beyond 2100 (medium confidence).* Under one scenario including a peak and decline in atmospheric CO2 
concentration (SSP5-3.4-OS), some climate metrics such as GSAT begin to decline but do not fully reverse 
by 2100 to levels prior to the CO2 peak (medium confidence). GMSL continues to rise in all models up to 
2100 despite a reduction in CO2 to 2040 levels. {4.6.3, 4.7.1, 4.7.2} 

*Using extended scenarios beyond 2100, projections show likely warming by 2300, relative to 
1850−1900, of 1.0°C−2.2°C for SSP1-2.6 and 6.6°C−14.1°C for SSP5-8.5.* By 2300, warming under the 
SSP5-3.4-OS overshoot scenario decreases from a peak around year 2060 to a level very similar to SSP1-2.6. 
Precipitation over land continues to increase strongly under SSP5-8.5. GSAT projected for the end of the 
23rd century under SSP2-4.5 (2.3−4.6°C) has not been experienced since the mid-Pliocene, about 3 million 
years ago. GSAT projected for the end of the 23rd century under SSP5-8.5 (6.6−14.1°C) overlaps with the 
range estimated for the Miocene Climatic Optimum (5°C−10°C) and Early Eocene Climatic Optimum 
(10°C−18°C), about 15 and 50 million years ago, respectively (medium confidence). {2.3.1.1, 4.7.1} 

# 4.1  Scope and Overview of this Chapter 

This chapter assesses simulations of future climate change, covering both near-term and long-term global 
changes. The chapter assesses simulations of physical indicators of global climate change, such as global 
surface air temperature (GSAT), global land precipitation, Arctic sea-ice area (SIA), and global mean sea 
level (GMSL). Furthermore, the chapter covers indices and patterns of properties and circulation not only for 
mean fields but also for modes of variability that have global significance. The choice of quantities to be 
assessed is summarized in Cross-Chapter Box 2.2 and comprises a subset of the quantities covered in 
Chapters 2 and 3. This chapter provides consistent coverage from near-term to long-term global changes and 
provides the global reference for the later chapters covering important processes and regional change. 

Essential input to the simulations assessed here is provided by future scenarios of concentrations or 
anthropogenic emissions of radiatively active substances; the scenarios represent possible sets of decisions 
by humanity, without any assessment that one set of decisions is more probable to occur than any other set 
(see Chapter 1, Section 1.6). As in previous assessment reports, these scenarios are used for projections of 
future climate using global atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) and Earth system 
models (ESMs, see Chapter 1, Section 1.5.3); the latter include representation of various biogeochemical 
cycles such as the carbon cycle, the sulphur cycle, or ozone (e.g., Flato, 2011; Flato et al., 2013). This 
chapter thus provides a comprehensive assessment of the future global climate response to different future 
anthropogenic perturbations to the climate system.  

Every projection assessment is conditioned on a particular forcing scenario. If sufficient evidence is 
available, a detailed probabilistic assessment of a physical climate outcome can be performed for each 
scenario separately. By contrast, there is no agreed-upon approach to assigning probabilities to forcing 
scenarios, to the point that it has been debated whether such an approach can even exist (e.g., Grübler and 
Nakicenovic, 2001; Schneider, 2001, 2002). Although there were some recent attempts to ascribe subjective 
probabilities to scenarios (e.g., Ho et al., 2019; Hausfather and Peters, 2020), and although ‘feasibility’ along 
different dimensions is an important concept in scenario research (see AR6 WGIII Chapter 3), the scenarios 
used for the model-based projections assessed in this chapter do not come with statements about their 
likelihood of actually unfolding in the future. Therefore, it is usually not possible to combine responses to 
individual scenarios into an overall probabilistic statement about expected future climate. Exceptions to this 
limit in the assessment are possible only under special circumstances, such as for some statements about 
near-term climate changes that are largely independent of the scenario chosen (e.g., Section 4.4.1). Beyond 
this, no combination of responses to different scenarios can be assessed in this chapter but may be possible in 
future assessments. 

A central element of this chapter is a comprehensive assessment of the sources of uncertainty of future 
projections (see Chapter 1, Section 1.4.3). Uncertainty can be broken down into scenario uncertainty, model 
uncertainty involving model biases, uncertainty in simulated effective radiative forcing and model response, 
and the uncertainty arising from internal variability (Cox and Stephenson, 2007; Hawkins and Sutton, 2009). 
An additional source of projection uncertainty arises from possible future volcanic eruptions and future solar 
variability. Assessment of uncertainty relies on multi-model ensembles such as the Coupled Model 
Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6, Eyring et al., 2016), single-model initial-condition large 
ensembles (e.g., Kay et al., 2015; Deser et al., 2020), and ensembles initialized from the observed climate 
state (decadal predictions, e.g., Smith et al., 2013a; Meehl et al., 2014a; Boer et al., 2016; Marotzke et al., 
2016). Ensemble evaluation methods include assessment of model performance and independence (e.g., 
Knutti et al., 2017; Boe, 2018; Abramowitz et al., 2019); emergent and other observational constraints (e.g., 
Allen and Ingram, 2002; Hall and Qu, 2006; Cox et al., 2018); and the uncertainty assessment of equilibrium 
climate sensitivity and transient climate response in Chapter 7. Ensemble evaluation is assessed in Box 4.1 
through the inclusion of lines of evidence in addition to the projection ensembles, including implications for 
potential model weighting. 

The uncertainty assessment in this chapter builds on one particularly noteworthy advance since the IPCC 
Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). Internal variability, which constitutes irreducible uncertainty over much of 
the time horizon considered here (Hawkins et al., 2016; Marotzke, 2019), can be better estimated in models 
even under a changing climate through the use of large initial-condition ensembles (Kay et al., 2015). For 
many climate quantities and compared to the forced climate change signal, internal variability is dominant in 
any individual realization – including the one that will unfold in reality – in the near term (Kirtman et al., 
2013; Marotzke and Forster, 2015), is substantial in the mid-term, and is still recognizable in the long term in 
many quantities (Deser et al., 2012a; Marotzke and Forster, 2015). This chapter will use the strengthend 
information on internal variability throughout. 
 
The expanded treatment of uncertainty allows this chapter a more comprehensive assessment of the benefits 
from mitigation than in previous IPCC reports, as well as the climate response to Carbon Dioxide Removal 
(CDR) and Solar Radiation Modification (SRM), and how to detect them against the backdrop of internal 
variability. Important advances have been made in the detection and attribution of mitigation, CDR, and 
SRM (Bürger and Cubasch, 2015; Lo et al., 2016; Ciavarella et al., 2017); exploring the ‘time of emergence’ 
(ToE; see Annex VII: Glossary) of responses to assumed emissions reductions (Tebaldi and Friedlingstein, 
2013)(Samset et al., 2020) and the attribution of decadal events to forcing changes that reflect emissions 
reductions (Marotzke, 2019; Spring et al., 2020)(McKenna et al., 2021).  
 
The question of the potential crossing of thresholds relative to global temperature goals (Geden and 
Loeschel, 2017) is intimately related to the benefits of mitigation; a prerequisite is an assessment of how 
robustly magnitudes of warming can be defined (Millar et al., 2017). This chapter provides an update to the 
IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5, Masson-Delmotte et al., 2018) and constitutes a 
reference point for later chapters and AR6 WGIII on the effects of mitigation, including a robust uncertainty 
assessment.  
 
<figref>4.1</figref> 
 
The chapter is organized as follows (see Figure 4.1). After Section 4.2 on the methodologies used in the 
assessment, Section 4.3 assesses projected changes in key global climate indicators throughout the 21st 
century, relative to the period 1995–2014, which comprises the last twenty years of the historical simulations 
of CMIP6 (Eyring et al., 2016) and hence the most recent past simulated with the observed atmospheric 
composition. The global climate indicators assessed include GSAT, global land precipitation, Arctic sea-ice 
area (SIA), global mean sea level (GMSL), the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), global 
mean ocean surface pH, carbon uptake by land and ocean, the global monsoon, the Northern and Southern 
Annular Modes (NAM and SAM), and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Differently from the 
assessment for changes in other quantities only based on the range of CMIP6 projections, additional lines of 
evidence enter the assessment for GSAT and GMSL change. For most results and figures based on CMIP6, 
one realization from each model (the first of the uploaded set) is used. Section 4.3 finally synthesizes the 
assessment of GSAT change using multiple lines of evidence in addition to the CMIP6 projection 
simulations.  
 
Section 4.4 covers near-term climate change, defined here as the period 2021–2040 and taken relative to the 
period 1995–2014. Section 4.4 focuses on global and large-scale climate indicators, including precipitation 
and circulation indices and selected modes of variability (see Cross-chapter Box 2.2 and Annex AIV), as 
well as on the spatial distribution of warming. The potential roles of short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) and 
volcanic eruptions on near-term climate change are also discussed. Section 4.4 synthesizes information from 
initialized predictions and non-initialized projections for the near-term change.  

Section 4.5 then covers mid-term and long-term climate change, defined here as the periods 2041–2060 and 
2081–2100, respectively, again relative to the period 1995–2014. The mid-term period is thus chosen as the 
twenty-year period following the short-term period and straddling the mid-century point, year 2050; it is 
during the mid-term that differences between different scenarios are expected to emerge against internal 
variability. The long-term period is defined, as in the AR5, as the twenty-year period at the end of the 
century. Section 4.5 assesses the same set of indicators as Section 4.4, as well as changes in internal 
variability and in large-scale patterns, both of which are expected to emerge in the mid- to long-term. The 
chapter sub-division according to time slices (near term, mid-term, and long term) is thus to a large extent 
motivated by the different roles that internal variability plays in each period, compared to the expected 
forced climate-change signal.  
 
Section 4.6 assesses the climate implications of climate policies, as simulated with climate models. First, 
Section 4.6 assesses patterns of climate change expected for various levels of GSAT rise including 1.5°C, 
2°C, 3°C, and 4°C, compared to the approximation to the pre-industrial period 1850–1900 to facilitate 
immediate connection to the SR1.5 and the temperature goals specified in the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC, 
2016). Section 4.6 continues with climate goals, overshoot, and path-dependence, as well as the climate 
response to mitigation, CDR, and SRM. Section 4.6 also covers the consistency between RCPs and SSPs.  
 
Section 4.7 assesses very long-term changes in selected global climate indicators, from 2100 to 2300. 
Section 4.7 continues with climate-change commitment and the potential for irreversibility and abrupt 
climate change. The chapter concludes with Section 4.8 on the potential for low-probability–high-impact 
changes, followed by answers to three frequently asked questions (FAQs).  
 
 
# 4.2  Methodology 
 
## 4.2.1  Models, Model Intercomparison Projects, and Ensemble Methodologies  
 
Similar to the approach used in AR5 (Flato et al., 2013), the primary lines of evidence of this chapter are 
comprehensive climate models (atmosphere-ocean general circulation models, AOGCMs) and Earth system 
models (ESMs); ESMs differ from AOGCMs by including representations of various biogeochemical cycles. 
We also build on results from Earth system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs, Claussen et al., 
2002; Eby et al., 2013) and other types of models where appropriate. This chapter focuses on a particular set 
of coordinated multi-model experiments known as model intercomparison projects (MIPs). These 
frameworks recommend and document standards for experimental design for running AOGCMs and ESMs 
to minimise the chance of differences in results being misinterpreted. CMIP is an activity of the World 
Climate Research Programme (WCRP), and the latest phase is CMIP6 (Eyring et al., 2016). To establish 
robustness of results, it is vital to assess the performance of these models in terms of mean state, variability, 
and the response to external forcings. That evaluation has been undertaken using the CMIP6 ‘Diagnostic, 
Evaluation and Characterization of Klima’ (DECK) and historical simulations in AR6 Chapter 3, which 
concludes that there is high confidence that the CMIP6 multi-model mean captures most aspects of observed 
climate change well (Chapter 3, Section 3.8.3.1). 
 
This chapter draws mainly on future projections referenced both against the period 1850–1900 and the recent 
past, 1995–2014, performed primarily under ScenarioMIP (O’Neill et al., 2016). This allows us to assess 
both dimensions of integration across scenarios (Section 4.3) and global warming levels (Section 4.6) as 
discussed in Chapter 1, Section 1.6. Other MIPs also target future scenarios with a focus on specific 
processes or feedbacks and are summarised in Table 4.1. 
 
<tableref>4.1</tableref> 
 
Multi-model ensembles provide the central focus of projection assessment. While single-model experiments 
have great value for exploring new results and theories, multi-model ensembles additionally underpin the 
assessment of the robustness, reproducibility, and uncertainty attributable to model internal structure and 
processes variability (Hawkins and Sutton, 2009) (see Section 4.2.5). Techniques underlying the 
combination of evaluation and weighting that are applied in this chapter are synthesized in Box 4.1.  
 
Climate model simulations can be performed in either ‘concentration-driven’ or ‘emissions-driven’ 
configuration reflecting whether the CO2 concentration is prescribed to follow a pre-defined pathway or is 
simulated by the Earth system models in response to prescribed emissions of CO2 (see Box 6.4 in Ciais et al., 
2013). The majority of CMIP6 experiments are conducted in concentration-driven configurations in order to 
enable models without a fully interactive carbon cycle to perform them, and throughout most of this chapter 
we present results from those simulations unless otherwise stated. Concentrations of other greenhouse gases 
are always prescribed. However, the SSP5-8.5 scenario has also been performed in emissions-driven 
configuration (‘esm-ssp585’) by ten ESMs, and in Section 4.3.1.1 we assess the impact on simulated climate 
over the 21st century. 
 
Internal variability complicates the identification of forced climate signals, especially when considering 
regional climate signals over short timescales (up to a few decades), such as local trends over the satellite era 
(Hawkins and Sutton, 2009; Deser et al., 2012a; Xie et al., 2015; Lovenduski et al., 2016; Suárez-Gutiérrez 
et al., 2017). Large initial-condition ensembles, where the same model is run repeatedly under identical 
forcing but with initial conditions varied through small perturbations or by sampling different times of a pre-
industrial control run, have substantially grown in their use since the AR5 (Deser et al., 2012a; Kay et al., 
2015; Rodgers et al., 2015; Hedemann et al., 2017; Stolpe et al., 2018; Maher et al., 2019a). Such large 
ensembles have shown potential to quantify uncertainty due to internal variability (Hawkins et al., 2016; 
McCusker et al., 2016; Sigmond and Fyfe, 2016; Lehner et al., 2017; McKinnon et al., 2017; Marotzke, 
2019) and thereby extract the forced signal from the internal variability, which can be calibrated against 
observational data to improve the reliability of probabilistic climate projections over the near and mid-term 
(O’Reilly et al., 2020). Moreover, they allow the investigation of forced changes in internal variability (e.g., 
Maher et al., 2018). A key assumption is that a given model skilfully represents internal variability; 
structural uncertainty is not accounted for. 
 
A complementary approach that represents structural uncertainty in a given model is stochastic physics 
(Berner et al., 2017). The approach has proven useful in representing structural uncertainty on seasonal 
climate timescales (Weisheimer et al., 2014; Batté and Doblas-Reyes, 2015; MacLachlan et al., 2015). 
Stochastic physics can markedly improve the internal variability in a given model (Dawson and Palmer, 
2015; Wang et al., 2016; Christensen et al., 2017; Davini et al., 2017; Watson et al., 2017; Strømmen et al., 
2018; Yang et al., 2019). Stochastic physics can also correct long-standing mean-state biases (Sanchez-
Gomez et al., 2016) and can influence the predicted climate sensitivity (Christensen and Berner, 2019; 
Strommen et al., 2019; Meccia et al., 2020).  
 
Perturbed-physics ensembles (Murphy et al., 2004) are also used to systematically account for parameter 
uncertainty in a given model. Uncertain model parameters are identified and ranges in their values selected 
that conform to emergent observational constraints (see Chapter 1, Section 1.5.4.2). These parameters are 
then changed between ensemble members to sample the effect of parameter uncertainty on climate (Piani et 
al., 2005; Sexton et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2018; Regayre et al., 2018). It is possible to weight ensemble 
members according to some performance metric or emergent constraint (e.g., Fasullo et al., 2015; Section 
1.5.4.7) to improve the ensemble distribution (see also Box 4.1).  
 
 
## 4.2.2  Scenarios  
 
The AR5 drew heavily on four main scenarios, known as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs: 
Meinshausen et al., 2011; van Vuuren et al., 2011), and simulation results from CMIP5 (Taylor et al., 2012, 
see Section 4.2.1). The RCPs were labelled by the approximate radiative forcing reached at the year 2100, 
going from 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 to 8.5 W m-2. 
 
This chapter draws on model simulations from CMIP6 (Eyring et al., 2016) using a new range of scenarios 
based on Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs; O’Neill et al., 2016). The set of SSPs is described in 
detail in Chapter 1 (see Section 1.6) and recognizes that global radiative forcing levels can be achieved by 
different pathways of CO2, non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHGs), aerosols (Amann et al., 2013; Rao et al., 
2017), and land use; the set of SSPs therefore establishes a matrix of global forcing levels and socio-
economic storylines. ScenarioMIP (O’Neill et al., 2016) identifies four priority (tier-1) scenarios that 
participating modelling groups are asked to perform, SSP1-2.6 for sustainable pathways, SSP2-4.5 for 
middle-of-the-road, SSP3-7.0 for regional rivalry, and SSP5-8.5 for fossil-fuel-rich development. This 
chapter focuses its assessment on these, plus the SSP1-1.9 scenario, which is directly relevant the assessment 
of the 1.5°C Paris Agreement goal. Further, this chapter discusses these scenarios and their extensions past 
2100 in the context of the very long-term climate change in Section 4.7.1. Projections of short-lived climate 
forcers (SLCFs) are assessed in more detail in Chapter 6 (Section 6.7). 
 
In presenting results and evidence, this chapter tries to be as comprehensive as possible. In tables we show 
multi-model mean change and 5⎼95% range for all five SSPs, while in time series figures we show multi-
model mean change for all five SSPs but for clarity 5⎼95% range only for SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0. Where 

maps are presented, due to space restrictions we focus on showing multi-model mean change for SSP1-2.6 
and SSP3-7.0. SSP1-2.6 is preferred over SSP1-1.9 because the latter has far fewer simulations available.  
The high-end scenarios RCP8.5 or SSP5-8.5 have recently been argued to be implausible to unfold (e.g., 
(Hausfather and Peters, 2020); see Chapter 3 of the AR6 WGIII). However, where relevant we show results 
for SSP5-8.5, for example to enable backwards compatibility with AR5, for comparison between emission-
driven and concentration-driven simulations, and because there is greater data availability of daily output for 
SSP5-8.5. When presenting low-likelihood high-warming storylines we also show results from the high-end 
SSP5-8.5 scenario. 
 
ScenarioMIP simulations include advances in techniques to better harmonize with historical forcings relative 
to CMIP5. For example, projected changes in the solar cycle include long-term modulation rather than a 
repeating solar cycle (Matthes et al., 2017). Background natural aerosols are ramped down to an average 
historical level used in the control simulation by 2025 and background volcanic forcing is ramped up from 
the value at the end of the historical simulation period (2015) over 10 years to the same constant value 
prescribed for the piControl simulations in the DECK, and then kept fixed – both changes are intended to 
avoid inconsistent model treatment of unknowable natural forcing to affect the near-term projected warming.  
Complete backward comparability between CMIP5 and CMIP6 scenarios cannot be established for detailed 
regional assessments, because the SSP scenarios include regional forcings ⎼ especially from land use and 
aerosols ⎼ that are different from the CMIP5 RCPs. Even at a global level, a quantitative comparison is 
challenging between corresponding SSP and RCP radiative forcing levels due to differing contributions to 
the forcing (Meinshausen et al., 2020) and evidence of differing model responses (Wyser et al., 2020) 
(Section 4.6.2.2). The RCP scenarios assessed in the AR5 all showed similar, rapid reductions in SLCFs and 
emissions of SLCF precursor species over the 21st century; the CMIP5 projections hence did not sample a 
wide range of possible trajectories for future SLCFs (Chuwah et al., 2013). The SSP scenarios assessed in 
the AR6 offer more scope to explore SLCF pathways as they sample a broader range of air quality policy 
options (Gidden et al., 2019) and relationships of CO2 to non-CO2 greenhouse gases (Meinshausen et al., 
2020). Section 4.6.2.2 assesses RCP and SSP differences. Other MIPs (see Section 4.2.1) have been designed 
to explicitly explore some of the implications of the different socio-economic storylines for a given radiative 
forcing level.  
 
 
## 4.2.3  Sources of Near-Term Information 
 
This subsection describes the three main sources of near-term information used in Chapter 4. These are 1) 
the projections from the CMIP6 multi-model ensemble introduced in Section 4.2.1 (Eyring et al., 2016; 
O’Neill et al., 2016), 2) observationally constrained projections (Gillett et al., 2013; Stott et al., 2013), and 3) 
the initialized predictions contributed to CMIP6 from the Decadal Climate Prediction Project (DCPP, Boer et 
al., 2016). The projections under 1) and the observational constraints under 2) are used for all time horizons 
considered in this chapter, whereas the initialized predictions under 3) are relevant only in the near term.  
 
Observationally constrained projections (Gillett et al., 2013, 2021; Shiogama et al., 2016; Ribes et al., 2021) 
use detection and attribution methods to attempt to reach consistency between observations and models and 
thus provide improved projections of near-term change. Notable advances have been made since the AR5, 
for example the ability to observationally constrain estimates of Arctic sea-ice loss for global warming of 
1.5°C, 2.0°C, and 3.0°C above pre-industrial levels (Screen and Williamson, 2017; Jahn, 2018; Screen, 
2018; Sigmond et al., 2018). There is high confidence that these approaches can reduce the uncertainties 
involved in such estimates. 
 
The AR5 was the first IPCC report to assess decadal climate predictions initialized from the observed 
climate state (Kirtman et al., 2013), and assessed with high confidence that these predictions exhibit positive 
skill for near-term average surface temperature information, globally and over large regions, for up to ten 
years. Substantially more experience in producing initialized decadal predictions has been gained since the 
AR5; the remainder of this subsection assesses the advances made. 
 
Because the ‘memory’ that potentially enables prediction of multi-year to decadal internal variability resides 
mainly in the ocean, some systems initialize the ocean state only (e.g., Müller et al., 2012; Yeager et al., 
2018), whereas others incorporate observed information in the initial atmospheric states (e.g., Pohlmann et 
al., 2013; Knight et al., 2014) or other non-oceanic drivers that provide further sources of predictability 
(Alessandri et al., 2014; Weiss et al., 2014; Bellucci et al., 2015a). 
 
Ocean initialization techniques generally use one of two strategies. Under full-field initialization, estimates 
of observed climate states are represented directly on the model grid. A potential drawback is that 
predictions initialized using the full-field approach tend to drift toward the biased climate preferred by the 
model (Smith et al., 2013a; Bellucci et al., 2015c; Sanchez-Gomez et al., 2016; Kröger et al., 2018; Nadiga 
et al., 2019). Such drifts can be as large as, or larger than, the climate anomaly being predicted and may 
therefore obscure predicted climate anomalies (Kröger et al., 2018) unless corrected for through post-
processing. By contrast, anomaly initialization reduces drifts by adding observed anomalies (i.e., deviations 
from mean climate) to the mean model climate (Pohlmann et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2013a; Thoma et al., 
2015b; Cassou et al., 2018), but has the disadvantage that the model state is then further from the real world 
from the start of the prediction. For both approaches, unrealistic features in the observation data used for 
initialization may induce unrealistic transient behavior (Pohlmann et al., 2017; Teng et al., 2017; Nadiga et 
al., 2019), and non-linearity can reduce forecast skill (Chikamoto et al., 2019). As yet, neither of the 
initialization strategies has been clearly shown to be superior (Hazeleger et al., 2013; Magnusson et al., 
2013; Smith et al., 2013a; Marotzke et al., 2016), although such comparisons may be sensitive to the model, 
region, and details of the initialization and forecast assessment procedures considered (Polkova et al., 2014; 
Bellucci et al., 2015c). 
 
There is also a wide range of techniques employed to assimilate observed information into models in order to 
generate suitable initial conditions (Polkova et al., 2019). These range in complexity from simple relaxation 
towards observed time series of sea surface temperature (SST) (Mignot et al., 2016) or wind stress anomalies 
(Thoma et al., 2015a, 2015b), to relaxation toward three-dimensional ocean and sometimes atmospheric state 
estimates from various sources (e.g., Pohlmann et al., 2013; Knight et al., 2014; Dunstone et al., 2016), or 
hybrid relaxation combining surface and tri-dimensional restoring as function of ocean basins and depth 
(Sanchez-Gomez et al., 2016), to sophisticated data assimilation methods such as the ensemble Kalan filter  
(Nadiga et al., 2013; Counillon et al., 2014, 2016; Msadek et al., 2014; Karspeck et al., 2015; Brune et al., 
2018; Cassou et al., 2018; Polkova et al., 2019) the four-dimensional ensemble-variational hybrid data 
assimilation  (He et al., 2017, 2020) and the initialization of sea ice (Guemas et al., 2016; Kimmritz et al., 
2018). In addition, decadal predictions necessarily consist of ensembles of forecasts to quantify uncertainty 
as discussed in Section 4.2.1. A common way to generate an ensemble is through sets of initial conditions 
containing small variations that lead to different subsequent climate trajectories. A variety of methods and 
assumptions has been employed to generate and filter initial-condition ensembles for decadal prediction 
(e.g., Marini et al., 2016; Kadow et al., 2017). As yet, there is no clear consensus as to which initialization 
and ensemble generation techniques are most effective, and evaluations of their comparative performance 
within a single modelling framework are needed (Cassou et al., 2018). 
 
A consequence of model imperfections and resulting model systematic errors is that estimates of these errors 
must be removed from the prediction to isolate the predicted climate anomaly and the phase of the decadal 
modes of climate variability (see Annex IV, Sections AIV.2.6 and AIV.2.7 and Section 4.4.3.5 and 4.4.3.6). 
Because of the tendency for systematic drifts to occur following initialization, bias corrections generally 
depend on time since the start of the forecast, often referred to as lead time. In practice, the lead-time-
dependent biases are calculated using ensemble retrospective predictions, also known as hindcasts, and 
recommended basic procedures for such corrections are provided in previous studies (Goddard et al., 2013; 
Boer et al., 2016). The biases are also dynamically corrected during hindcasts and predictions by 
incorporating the multi-year monthly mean analysis increments from the initialization into the initial 
condition at each integration step (Wang et al., 2013b). Besides mean climate as a function of lead time, 
further aspects of decadal predictions may be biased, such as the modes of variability (see Annex IV and 
Chapter 3, Section 3.7) upon which drift patterns are projecting (Sanchez-Gomez et al., 2016), and additional 
correction procedures have thus been proposed to remove biases in representing long-term trends (Kharin et 
al., 2012; Kruschke et al., 2016; Balaji et al., 2018; Pasternack et al., 2018), as well as more general 
dependences of drift on initial conditions (Fučkar et al., 2014; Pasternack et al., 2018; Nadiga et al., 2019). 
 
Many skill measures exist that describe different aspects of the correspondence between predicted and 
observed conditions, and no single metric should be considered exclusively. Important aspects of forecast 
performance captured by different skill measures include: 1) the ability to predict the sign and phases of the 
main modes of decadal variability and their regional fingerprint through teleconnections; 2) the typical 
magnitude of differences between predicted and observed values, forecast reliability and resolution (Corti et 
al., 2012); and 3) whether the forecast ensemble appropriately represents uncertainty in the predictions. A 
framework for skill assessment that encompasses each of these aspects of forecast quality has been proposed 
(Goddard et al., 2013). A new, process-based method to assess forecast skill in decadal predictions is to 
analyse how well a specific mechanism is represented at each lead time (Mohino et al., 2016). 
 
One additional aspect of forecast quality assessment is that estimated skill can be degraded by errors in 
observational datasets used for verification, in addition to errors in the predictions (Massonnet et al., 2016; 
Ferro, 2017; Karspeck et al., 2017; Juricke et al., 2018). This suggests that skill may tend to be 
underestimated, particularly for climate variables whose observational uncertainties are relatively large, and 
that the predictions themselves may prove useful for assessing the quality of observational datasets 
(Massonnet, 2019).  
 
Skill assessments have shown that initialized predictions can out-perform their uninitialized counterparts  
(Doblas-Reyes et al., 2013; Meehl et al., 2014; Bellucci et al., 2015b; Smith et al., 2018; Yeager et al., 2018; 
Smith et al., 2019b), although such comparisons are sensitive to the region and variable considered, multi-
model predictions are generally more skilful than individual models (Doblas-Reyes et al., 2013; Smith et al., 
2013b, 2019b). Considerable skill, especially for temperature, can be attributed to external forcings such as 
changes in GHG, aerosol concentrations, and volcanic eruptions. On a global scale, this contribution to skill 
has been found to exceed that from the prediction of internal variability except in the early stages (about one 
year for global SST) of the forecast (Corti et al., 2015)(Sospedra-Alfonso and Boer, 2020)(Bilbao et al., 
2021), though idealized potential skill measures and observations-based studies suggest that improving the 
prediction of internal variability could extend this crossover to longer lead times (Boer et al., 2013; Årthun et 
al., 2017). In some cases, part of the skill arises from the ability of initialized predictions to capture observed 
transitions of major modes of climate variability (Meehl et al., 2016) such as the Pacific Decadal Variability 
(PDV) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV) (see  Sections 4.4.3.5 and 4.4.3.6, and Annex IV, 
Sections AIV.2.6 and AIV.2.7).  
 
Initialized predictions of near-surface temperature are particularly skilful over the North Atlantic, a region of 
high potential and realised predictability (Keenlyside et al., 2008; Pohlmann et al., 2009; Boer et al., 2013; 
Yeager and Robson, 2017). Much of this predictability is associated with the North Atlantic subpolar gyre 
(Wouters et al., 2013), where skill in predicting ocean conditions is typically high (Hazeleger et al., 2013; 
Brune and Baehr, 2020) and shifts in ocean temperature and salinity potentially affecting surface climate can 
be predicted up to several years in advance (Robson et al., 2012; Hermanson et al., 2014), although such 
assessments remain challenging due to incomplete knowledge of the state of the ocean during the hindcast 
evaluation periods (Menary and Hermanson, 2018). A substantial improvement of the sub-polar gyre SST 
prediction is found in CMIP6 models, which is attributed to a more accurate response to the AMOC-related 
delayed response to volcanic eruptions (Borchert et al., 2021) (see Section 4.4.3).  A significant 
improvement GSAT prediction skill is also found over some land regions including East Asia (Monerie et 
al., 2018), Eurasia (Wu et al., 2019), Europe (Müller et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2019b) and the Middle East 
(Smith et al., 2019b). 
 
Skill for multi-year to decadal precipitation forecasts is generally much lower than for temperature, although 
one exception is Sahel rainfall (Sheen et al., 2017), due to its dependence on predictable variations in North 
Atlantic SST through teleconnections (Martin and Thorncroft, 2014a) (Annex IV). Predictive skill on 
decadal timescales is found for extratropical storm-tracks and storm density (Kruschke et al., 2016; Schuster 
et al., 2019a), atmospheric blocking (Schuster et al., 2019b; Athanasiadis et al., 2020), the Quasi-Biennial 
Oscillation (QBO) (Scaife et al., 2014; Pohlmann et al., 2019) and over the tropical oceans (tropical trans-
basin variability) (Chikamoto et al., 2015). In addition, decadal predictions with large ensemble sizes are 
able to predict multi-annual temperature (Peters et al., 2011)(Sienz et al., 2016)(Borchert et al., 2019) 
(Sospedra-Alfonso and Boer, 2020), precipitation (Yeager et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2019b), and atmospheric 
circulation (Smith et al., 2020) anomalies over certain land regions, although the ensemble-mean magnitudes 
are much weaker than observed. This discrepancy may be symptomatic of an apparent deficiency in climate 
models that causes some predictable signal, such as that associated to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) 
(see Section AIV.2.1), to be much weaker than in nature (Eade et al., 2014; Scaife and Smith, 2018; 
Strommen and Palmer, 2019; Smith et al., 2020), while others, such as that linked to the Southern Annular 
Mode (SAM) (see Section AIV.2.2), are more consistent with observations (Byrne et al., 2019) 
 
Evidence is accumulating that additional properties of the Earth system relating to ocean variability may be 
skilfully predicted on multi-annual timescales. These include levels of Atlantic hurricane activity (Smith et 
al., 2010; Caron et al., 2017), winter sea-ice in the Arctic (Onarheim et al., 2015; Dai et al., 2020), drought 
and wildfire (Chikamoto et al., 2017; Paxian et al., 2019; Solaraju-Murali et al., 2019), and variations in the 
ocean carbon cycle including CO2 uptake (Li et al., 2016b, 2019; Lovenduski et al., 2019; Fransner et al., 
2020) and chlorophyll (Park et al., 2019).  
 
In summary, despite challenges (Cassou et al., 2018), there is high confidence that initialized predictions 
contribute information to near-term climate change for some regions over multiannual to decadal timescales.  
Furthermore, there are indications that initialized predictions can constrain near-term projections (Befort et 
al., 2020). The clearest improvements through initialization are seen in the North Atlantic and related 
phenomena such as hurricane frequency, Sahel and European rainfall. By contrast, there is medium or low 
confidence that uncertainty is reduced for other climate variables. 
 
 
## 4.2.4  Pattern Scaling  
 
Projected climate change is typically represented in this chapter for specific future periods. One important 
source of uncertainty in projections presented for fixed future epochs (time-slabs/time-slices) is the 
underlying scenario used; another is the structural uncertainty associated with model climate sensitivity. 
Presenting projections and associated measures of uncertainty for specific periods (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5) 
remains the most widely applied methodology towards informing climate change impact studies. It is 
becoming increasingly important from the perspective of climate change and mitigation policy, however, to 
present projections also as a function of the change in global mean temperature (i.e., global warming levels, 
GWLs). They are expressed either in terms of changes of global mean surface temperature (GMST) or 
GSAT (see Chapter 1, Section 1.6.2 and Cross-Chapter Box 2.3). For example, the IPCC SR1.5 (Hoegh-
Guldberg et al., 2018) assessed the regional patterns of warming and precipitation change for GMST 
increase of 1.5°C and 2°C above 1850–1900 levels. Techniques used to represent the spatial variations in 
climate at a given GWL are referred to as pattern scaling. 
 
In the ‘traditional’ methodology as applied in the AR5 (Collins et al., 2013), patterns of climate change in 
space are calculated as the product of the change in GSAT at a given point in time and a spatial pattern of 
change that is constant over time and the scenario under consideration, and which may or may not depend on 
a particular climate model (Allen and Ingram, 2002; Mitchell, 2003; Lambert and Allen, 2009; Andrews and 
Forster, 2010; Bony et al., 2013; Lopez et al., 2014).  This approach assumes that external forcing does not 
affect the internal variability of the climate system, which may be regarded a stringent assumption when 
taking into account decadal and multi-decadal variability (Lopez et al., 2014) and the potential nonlinearity 
of the climate change signal. Moreover, pattern scaling is expected to have lower skill for variables with 
large spatial variability (Tebaldi and Arblaster, 2014). Pattern scaling also fails to capture changes in 
boundaries that moves poleward such as sea-ice extent and snow cover (Collins et al., 2013), and temporal 
frequency quantities such as frost days that decrease under warming but are bounded at zero. Spatial patterns 
are also expected to be different between transient and equilibrium simulations because of the long 
adjustment timescale of the deep ocean. 
 
Further developments of the AR5 approach have since explored the role of aerosols in modifying regional 
climate responses at a specific degree of global warming and also the effect of different GCMs and scenarios 
on the scaled spatial patterns (Frieler et al., 2012; Levy et al., 2013). Furthermore, the modified forcing-
response framework (Kamae and Watanabe, 2012, 2013; Sherwood et al., 2015), which decomposes the total 
climate change into fast adjustments and slow response, identifies the fast adjustment as forcing-dependent 
and the slow response as forcing-independent, scaling with the change in GSAT.  
 
For precipitation change, there is near-zero fast adjustment for solar forcing but suppression during the fast-
adjustment phase for CO2 and black-carbon radiative forcing (Andrews et al., 2009; Bala et al., 2010; Cao et 
al., 2015). By contrast, the slow response in precipitation change is independent of the forcing. This indicates 
that pattern scaling is not expected to work well for climate variables that have a large fast-adjustment 
component. Even in such cases, pattern scaling still works for the slow response component, but a correction 
for the forcing-dependent fast adjustment would be necessary to apply pattern scaling to the total climate 
change signal. In a multi-model setting, it has been shown that temperature change patterns conform better to 
pattern scaling approximation than precipitation patterns (Tebaldi and Arblaster, 2014). 
 
(Herger et al., 2015) have explored the use of multiple predictors for the spatial pattern of change at a given 
degree of global warming, following the approach of Joshi et al. (2013) that explored the role of the land-sea 
warming ratio as a second predictor. They found that the land-sea warming contrast changes in a non-linear 
way with GSAT, and that it approximates the role of the rate of global warming in determining regional 
patterns of climate change. The inclusion of the land-sea warming contrast as the second predictor provides 
the largest improvement over the traditional technique. However, as pointed out by Herger et al. (2015), 
multiple-predictor approaches still cannot detect nonlinearities (or internal variability), such as the apparent 
dependence of spatial temperature variability in the mid- to high latitudes on GSAT (e.g. Screen, 2014; 
Fischer and Knutti, 2014).  
 
An alternative to the traditional pattern scaling approach is the time-shift method described by Herger et al. 
(2015) which is applied in this chapter (also called the epoch approach, see Section 4.6.1). When applied to a 
transient scenario such as SSP5-8.5, a future time-slab is referenced to a particular increase in the GSAT 
(e.g., 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels). The spatial patterns that result represent a 
direct scaling of the spatial variations of climate change at the particular level of global warming. An 
important advantage of this approach is that it ensures physical consistency between the different variables 
for which changes are presented (Herger et al., 2015). The internal variability does not have to be scaled and 
is consistent with the GSAT change. The time-shift method furthermore allows for a partial comparison of 
how the rate of increase in GSAT influences the regional spatial patterns of climate change. For example, 
spatial patterns of change for global warming of 2°C can be compared across the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 
scenarios. Direct comparisons can also be obtained between variations in the regional impacts of climate 
change for the case where global warming stabilizes at, for instance, 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming, as 
opposed to the case where the GSAT reaches and then exceeds the 1.5°C or 2°C thresholds (Tebaldi and 
Knutti, 2018). An important potential caveat is that forcing mechanisms such as aerosol radiative forcing are 
represented differently in different models, even for the same SSP. This may imply different regional aerosol 
direct and indirect effects, implying different regional climate change patterns. Hence, it is important to 
consider the variations in the forcing mechanisms responsible for a specific increase in GSAT towards 
understanding the uncertainty range associated with the variations in regional climate change. A minor 
practical limitation of this approach is that stabilization scenarios at 1.5°C or 2°C of global warming, such as 
SSP1-2.6, do not allow for spatial patterns of change to be calculated from these scenarios at higher levels of 
global warming, while it is possible in scenarios such as SSP5-8.5 (Herger et al., 2015).  
 
In this chapter, the spatial patterns of change as a function of GWLs (defined in terms of the increase in the 
GSAT relative to 1850–1900) are thus constructed using the time-shift approach, thereby accounting for 
various nonlinearities and internal variability that influence the projected climate change signal. This implies 
a reliance on large ensemble sizes to quantify the role of uncertainties in regional responses to different 
degrees of global warming. The assessment in Section 4.6.1 also explores how the rate of global warming (as 
represented by different SSPs), aerosol effects, and transient as opposed to stabilization scenarios influence 
the spatial variations in climate change at specific levels of global warming. 
 
 
## 4.2.5  Quantifying Various Sources of Uncertainty  
 
The AR5 assessed with very high confidence that climate models reproduce the general features of the 
global-scale annual mean surface temperature increase over the historical period, including the more rapid 
warming in the second half of the 20th century, and the cooling immediately following large volcanic 
eruptions. Furthermore, because climate and Earth system models are based on physical principles, 
they were assessed in the AR5 to reproduce many important aspects of observed climate. Both aspects were 
argued to contribute to our confidence in the models’ suitability for their application in quantitative future 
predictions and projections (Flato et al., 2013). The AR6 assesses in Chapter 3, Section 3.8.2, with high 
confidence that for most large-scale indicators of climate change, the recent mean climate simulated by the 
latest generation climate models underpinning this assessment has improved compared to the models 
assessed in the AR5, and with high confidence that the multi-model mean captures most aspects of observed 
climate change well. These assessments form the foundation of applying climate and Earth system models to 
the projections assessed in this chapter. Where appropriate, the assessment of projected changes is 
accompanied by an assessment of process understanding and model evaluation.  
 
That said, fitness-for-purpose of the climate models used for long-term projections is fundamentally difficult 
to ascertain and remains an epistemological challenge (Parker, 2009; Frisch, 2015; Baumberger et al., 2017). 
Some literature exists comparing previous IPCC projections to what has unfolded over the subsequent 
decades (Cubasch et al., 2013), and recent work has confirmed that climate models since around 1970 have 
projected global surface warming in reasonable agreement with observations once the difference between 
assumed and actual forcing has been taken into account (Hausfather et al., 2020). However, the long-term 
perspective to the end of the 21st century or even out to 2300 takes us beyond what can be observed in time 
for a standard evaluation of model projections, and in this sense the assessment of long-term projections will 
remain fundamentally limited.  
 
The spread across individual runs within a multi-model ensemble represents the response to a combination of 
different sources of uncertainties (see Chapter 1, Section 1.4.3), specifically: scenario uncertainties, climate 
response uncertainties (also referred to as model uncertainties) related to parametric and other structural 
uncertainties in the model representation of the climate system, and internal variability (e.g., Hawkins and 
Sutton, 2009; Kirtman et al., 2013). While the nature of these uncertainties was introduced in Section 1.4.3, 
this subsection assesses methods to disentangle different sources of uncertainties and quantify their 
contributions to the overall ensemble spread. 
 
As discussed extensively in the AR5 (Collins et al., 2013), ensemble spread in projections performed with 
different climate models accounts for only part of the entire model uncertainty, even when considering the 
uncertainty in the radiative forcing in projections (Vial et al., 2013) and forced response. The AR5 
uncertainty characterisation (Kirtman et al., 2013) followed Hawkins and Sutton (2009) and diagnosed 
internal variability through a high-pass temporal filter. This approach has deficiencies particularly if internal 
variability manifests on the multi-decadal timescales (Deser et al., 2012a; Marotzke and Forster, 2015) and is 
classified as (model) response uncertainty instead of internal variability. Single-model initial-condition large 
ensembles revealed that the AR5 approach underestimates the role of internal variability uncertainty and 
overestimates the role of model uncertainty (Maher et al., 2018; Stolpe et al., 2018; Lehner et al., 2020) 
particularly at the local scale while yielding a reasonable approximation for uncertainty separation for GSAT 
(Lehner et al., 2020).  
 
Single-model initial-condition large ensembles thus represent a crucial step towards a cleaner separation of 
model uncertainty and internal variability than available for the AR5 (Deser et al., 2014, 2016; Saffioti et al., 
2017; Sippel et al., 2019; Milinski et al., 2020; von Trentini et al., 2020; Maher et al., 2021). Novel 
approaches have been proposed to further quantify internal variability in multi-model ensembles (Hingray 
and Saïd, 2014; Evin et al., 2019; Hingray et al., 2019). For time horizons beyond the limit of decadal 
predictability (Branstator and Teng, 2010; Meehl et al., 2014; Marotzke et al., 2016), such as in the CMIP6 
projections, the simulations are starting from random rather than assimilated initial conditions. Internal 
variability constitutes an uncertainty in the projection of the climate in a future period of 10 or 20 years that 
is irreducible, but can be precisely quantified for individual models using sufficiently large initial-condition 
ensembles (Fischer et al., 2013; Deser et al., 2016; Hawkins et al., 2016; Pendergrass et al., 2017; Luo et al., 
2018; Dai and Bloecker, 2019; Maher et al., 2019a; Deser et al., 2020).   
 
Uncertainties in emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols that affect future radiative forcings are 
represented by selected SSP scenarios (Section 4.2.2, Section 1.6.1). In addition to emission uncertainties, 
SSPs represent uncertainties in land use changes (van Vuuren et al., 2011)(Ciais et al., 2013)(O’Neill et al., 
2016)(Christensen et al., 2018). Additional uncertainty comes from climate carbon-cycle feedbacks and the 
residence time of atmospheric constituents, and are at least partly accounted for in emission-driven 
simulations as opposed to concentration-driven simulations (Friedlingstein et al., 2014; Hewitt et al., 2016). 
The climate carbon-cycle feedbacks affect the transient climate response to emissions (TCRE). Constraining 
this uncertainty is crucial for the assessment of remaining carbon budgets consistent with global mean 
temperature levels (Millar et al., 2017; Masson-Delmotte et al., 2018) and is covered in Chapter 5 of this 
Report. Finally, there are uncertainties in future solar and volcanic forcing (see Cross-Chapter Box 4.1) 
 
The relative magnitude of model uncertainty and internal variability depends on the time horizon of the 
projection, location, spatial and temporal aggregation, variable, and signal strength (Rowell, 2012; Fischer et 
al., 2013; Deser et al., 2014; Saffioti et al., 2017; Kirchmeier‐Young et al., 2019). New literature published 
after the AR5 systematically discusses the role of different sources of uncertainty and shows that the relative 
contribution of internal variability is larger for short than for long projection horizons (Marotzke and Forster, 
2015; Lehner et al., 2020; Maher et al., 2021), larger for high latitudes than for low latitudes, larger for land 
than for ocean variables, larger at station level than continental than global means, larger for annual 
maxima/minima than for multi-decadal means, larger for dynamic quantities (and, by implication, 
precipitation) than for temperature (Fischer et al., 2014).  
 
The method introduced by Hawkins and Sutton (2009) and applied to GSAT projections reveals that by the 
end of the 21st century, the fraction contribution of the climate model response uncertainty to the total 
uncertainty is larger in CMIP6 than in CMIP5 whereas the relative contribution of scenario uncertainty is 
smaller (Lehner et al., 2020). This is the case even when sub-selecting pathways and scenarios that are most 
similar in CMIP5 and CMIP6, i.e. the range from RCP2.6 to RCP8.5 vs. SSP1-2.6 to SSP5-8-5, respectively 
(Lehner et al., 2020). The larger range of response uncertainty is further consistent with the larger range of 
TCR and GSAT warming for a comparable pathway in CMIP6 than CMIP5 (Forster et al., 2020; Tokarska et 
al., 2020).   
 
Some uncertainties are not, or only partially accounted for in the CMIP6 experiments, such as uncertainties 
in natural forcings from solar and volcanic forcings, long-term Earth system feedbacks including land-ice 
feedbacks, groundwater feedbacks (Smerdon, 2017) or some long-term carbon-cycle feedbacks (Fischer et 
al., 2018). Where appropriate, this chapter uses results from non-CMIP ESMs or EMICs to assess the role of 
these feedbacks.  Still other uncertainties ⎼ such as further pandemics, nuclear holocaust, global natural 
disaster such as tsunami or asteroid impact, or fundamental technological change such as fusion ⎼ are not 
accounted for at all. 
 
 
## 4.2.6  Display of Model Agreement and Spread 
 
Maps of multi-model mean changes provide an average estimate for the forced model climate response to a 
certain forcing. However, they do not include any information on the robustness of the response across 
models nor on the significance of the change with respect to unforced internal variability (Tebaldi et al., 
2011). Models can consistently show absence of significant change, in which case they should not be 
expected to agree on the sign of a change (e.g.,  Tebaldi et al., 2011; Knutti and Sedláček, 2012; Fischer et 
al., 2014). If a multi-model mean map of precipitation shows no change, it is unclear whether the models 
consistently project insignificant changes or whether projections span both significant increases and 
significant decreases. Several methods have been proposed to distinguish significant conflicting signals from 
agreement on no significant change (Tebaldi et al., 2011; Knutti and Sedláček, 2013; McSweeney and Jones, 
2013; Zappa et al., 2021). A set of different methods have been introduced in the literature to display model 
robustness and to put a climate change signal into the context of internal variability. AR5 Box 12.1 provides 
a detailed assessment of different methods of mapping model robustness and Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1 
provides an update of recent proposals including the methods used in this report.  
 
Most methods for quantifying robustness assume that only one realization from each model is applied. There 
are challenges that arise from having heterogeneous multi-model ensembles with many members for some 
models and single members for others (Olonscheck and Notz, 2017; Evin et al., 2019). Furthermore, the 
methods that map model robustness usually ignore that sharing parametrizations or entire components across 
coupled models can lead to substantial model interdependence (Fischer et al., 2011; Kharin et al., 2012; 
Knutti et al., 2013, 2017; Leduc et al., 2015; Sanderson et al., 2015, 2017; Annan and Hargreaves, 2017; 
Boe, 2018; Abramowitz et al., 2019). This may lead to a biased estimate of model agreement if a substantial 
fraction of models is interdependent. The methodologies and results in these literature since AR5 are higher 
in quality and clarity. However, quantifying and accounting for model dependence in a robust way remains 
challenging (Abramowitz et al., 2019). Furthermore, absence of significant mean change in a certain climate 
variable does not imply absence of substantial impact, because there may be substantial change in variability, 
which is typically not mapped (McSweeney and Jones, 2013). 
 
Chapter 4 uses the advanced approach, taking into account the sign and significance of the change (Cross-
Chapter Box Atlas.1, approach C). Where not applicable, such as due to a lack of the necessary model 
output, the simple method is used taking into account only agreement on the sign of the change across the 
multi-model ensemble (Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1, approach B). The advanced approach is similar to the 
method used in AR5 but isolates conflicting signals as proposed in (Zappa et al., 2021). It uses three 
mutually exclusive categories and distinguishes (a) areas with significant change and high model agreement 
(no overlay), (b) areas with no change or no robust change (diagonal lines), and (c) areas with significant 
change but low agreement (crossed lines). Category (a) marks areas where the climate change signals likely 
emerge from internal variability, where two-thirds or more of the models project changes greater than 
internal variability and 80% or more of the models agree on the sign of the change. Category (b) marks areas 
where fewer than two-thirds of the models project changes greater than internal variability, and category (c) 
marks areas with significant but conflicting signals, where two-thirds or more of the models project changes 
greater than internal variability but less than 80% agree on the sign of the change.  
 

In this chapter variability is defined as 1.645 ∙ √2 𝜎𝜎20𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦, where 𝜎𝜎20𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦 is the standard deviation of 20-year 
means in the pre-industrial control simulations (see Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1). Category (a) uses a 
definition very similar to the AR5 method for stippling except that the model signal is compared to its 
corresponding internal rather than the multi-model mean variability, to account for the substantial model 
differences in pre-industrial internal variability (Parsons et al., 2020). Changes smaller than internal 
variability can have potential impacts particularly if they persist over sustained periods such as several 
decades. Finally, even when changes do not exceed variability at the grid point level they may exceed 
variability if aggregated over catchment basins, regions, or continents (Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1). Maps of 
mean changes also ignore potential changes in variability addressed by a more comprehensive assessment of 
changes in temperature variability (Section 4.5.1) and modes of internal variability (Sections 4.4.3).

# 4.3  Projected Changes in Global Climate Indices in the 21st Century  
 
This section assesses the latest simulations of representative indicators of global climate change presented as 
time series and tabulated values over the 21st century and across the main realms of the global climate 
system. In the atmospheric realm (see Section 4.3.1), we assess simulations of GSAT (see Figure 4.2a) and 
global land precipitation (see Figure 4.2b). Across the cryospheric, oceanic, and biospheric realms (see 
Section 4.3.2), we assess simulations of Arctic SIA (see Figure 4.2c), GMSL (see Figure 4.2d), the AMOC, 
ocean and land carbon uptake, and pH. In Section 4.3.3 we assess simulations of several indices of climate 
variability, namely, the indices of the NAM, SAM, and ENSO. Finally, Section 4.3.4 assesses future GSAT 
change based on the CMIP6 ensemble in combination with other lines of evidence. An assessment of 
projected changes in related global extreme indices can be found in Chapter 11. 
 
<figref>4.2</figref>
 
From the CMIP6 multi-model ensemble we consider historical simulations with observed external forcings 
to 2014 and extensions to 2100 based on the five high-priority scenarios. We use the first realization (‘r1’) 
contributed by each modelling group. In tabular form, we show ensemble-mean changes and uncertainties 
for the near-term (2021–2040), mid-term (2041–2060), and the long-term (2081–2100), relative to present-
day (1995–2014) and the approximation to pre-industrial (1850–1900). Changes in precipitation over land 
near 1.5°C, 2.0°C, 3.0°C, and 4.0°C of global warming relative to 1850–1900 are also assessed. 
 
 
## 4.3.1  Atmosphere  
 
### 4.3.1.1  Surface Air Temperature 
 
The AR5 assessed from CMIP5 simulations and other lines of evidence that GSAT will continue to rise over 
the 21st century if GHG concentrations continue increasing (Collins et al., 2013). The AR5 concluded that 
GSAT for 2081–2100, relative to 1986–2005 will likely be in the 5–95% range of 0.3°C–1.7°C under 
RCP2.6 and 2.6°C–4.8°C under RCP8.5. The corresponding ranges for the intermediate emission scenarios 
with emissions peaking around 2040 (RCP4.5) and 2060 (RCP6.0) are 1.1°C–2.6°C and 1.4°C–3.1°C, 
respectively. The AR5 further assessed that GSAT averaged over the period 2081–2100 are projected to 
likely exceed 1.5°C above 1850–1900 for RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (high confidence) and are likely to 
exceed 2°C above 1850–1900 for RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (high confidence). Global surface temperature 
changes above 2°C under RCP2.6 were deemed unlikely (medium confidence). 
 
Here, for continuity’s sake, we assess the CMIP6 simulations of GSAT in a fashion similar to the AR5 
assessment of the CMIP5 simulations. From these, we compute anomalies relative to 1995–2014 and display 
the evolution of ensemble means and 5–95% ranges (see Figure 4.2). We also use the ensemble mean GSAT 
difference between 1850–1900 and 1995–2014, 0.82°C, to provide an estimate of the changes since 1850–
1900 (see the right axis on Figure 4.2). Finally, we tabulate the ensemble mean changes between 1995–2014 
and 2021–2040, 2041–2060, and 2081–2100 respectively (see Figure 4.2).  
 
The CMIP6 models show a 5–95% range of GSAT change for 2081–2100, relative to 1995–2014, of 0.6°C–
2.0°C under SSP1-2.6 where CO2 concentrations peak between 2040 and 2060 (see Table 4.2). The 
corresponding range under the highest overall emission scenario (SSP5-8.5) is 2.7°C–5.7°C. The ranges for 
the intermediate emission scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0), where CO2 concentrations increase to 2100, 
but less rapidly than SSP5-8.5, are 1.4°C–3.0°C and 2.2°C–4.7°C, respectively. The range for the lowest 
emission scenario (SSP1-1.9) is 0.2°C–1.3°C. 
 
In summary, the CMIP6 models show a general tendency toward larger long-term globally averaged surface 
warming than did the CMIP5 models, for nominally comparable scenarios (very high confidence). In SSP1-
2.6 and SSP2-4.5, the 5–95% ranges have remained similar to the ranges in RCP2.6 and RCP4.5, 
respectively, but the distributions have shifted upward by about 0.3°C (high confidence). For SSP5-8.5 
compared to RCP8.5, the 5% bound of the distribution has hardly changed, but the 95% bound and the range 
have increased by about 20% and 40%, respectively (high confidence). About half of the warming increase 
has occurred because of more models with higher climate sensitivity in CMIP6, compared to CMIP5; the 
other half of the warming increase arises from higher effective radiative forcing in nominally comparable 
scenarios (medium confidence, see Section 4.6.2).  
 
<tableref>4.2</tableref>  
 
With regards to global warming levels (GWL) of 1.5°C, 2.0°C, and 3.0°C, we note that there is unanimity 
across all of the CMIP6 model simulations that GSAT change relative to 1850–1900 will rise above: 1) 
1.5°C following SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, or SSP5-8.5 (on average around 2030); 2) 2.0°C following either 
SSP3-7.0 or SSP5-8.5 (on average around 2043), and 3) 3.0°C following SSP5-8.5 (on average around 
2062). Under SSP1-1.9, 55% and 36% of the model simulations rise above 1.5°C and 2.0°C, respectively, 
while for SSP1-2.6 those percentages increase to 87% and 58%, respectively. Here, the time of GSAT 
exceedance is determined as the first year at which 21-year running averages of GSAT exceed the given 
GWL. In Section 4.3.4, these values are reassessed using CMIP6 ensemble in combination with other lines 
of evidence. 
 
CMIP6 models project increases in area-weighted land, ocean, tropical (30°S–30°N), Arctic (67.7°N–90°N), 
and Antarctic (90°S–55°S) surface air temperature (see Table 4.2). Consistent with AR5, and earlier 
assessments, CMIP6 models project that annual average surface air temperature will warm about 50% more 
over land than over the ocean, and that the Arctic will warm about more than 2.5 times the global average 
(see Section 4.5.1). For 2081–2100, relative to 1995–2014, the CMIP6 models show 5–95% ranges of 
warming over land of 0.3°C–2.0°C and 3.5°C–7.6°C following SSP1-1.9 and SSP5-8.5, respectively. The 
corresponding ranges for Arctic surface air temperature change are 0.5°C–6.6°C and 6.2°C–15.2°C, 
respectively. 
 
The concentration-driven simulations presented above use a prescribed CO2 pathway calculated by the 
MAGICC7.0 model using the CMIP6 emissions (Meinshausen et al., 2020). This is compared here with the 
CO2 concentration simulated by CMIP6 ESMs in response to the SSP5-8.5 emissions (Figure 4.3). The 
1995–2014 mean simulated CO2 level is 375 ppm, very similar to the prescribed 378 ppm, but the ESM 5–

95% range is 357–391 ppm. By the end of the 21st century (2081–2100), the ESM mean is 953 ppm ⎼ below 

the prescribed CO2 pathway (1004 ppm), but with a large 5–95% range of 848–1045 ppm, which spans the 
prescribed concentration level. This result differs from CMIP5, which showed that ESMs typically simulated 
CO2 concentrations higher than the prescribed concentration-driven RCP pathways. Reduced spread in 
CMIP6 carbon cycle feedbacks compared to CMIP5 has been postulated to be due to the inclusion of 
nitrogen cycle processes in about half of CMIP6 ESMs (Arora et al., 2020). This means that the CMIP6 
spread in GSAT response to CO2 emissions is dominated by climate sensitivity differences between ESMs 
more than by carbon cycle differences (Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020; Williams et al., 2020) (high 
confidence).  
 
Simulated GSAT over 1995–2014, relative to 1850–1900 period, warms by very similar amounts in the two 
sets of simulations: 0.82°C (0.45–1.31) in emissions-driven compared with 0.75°C (0.53–1.09) in 
concentration-driven simulations. By the end of the 21st century, warming in emissions-driven simulations is 
very similar: 4.58°C (3.53–6.70), reflecting the slightly lower CO2 concentration simulated by the ESMs 
compared with warming under the prescribed CO2 pathway of 4.69°C (3.70–6.77). This difference in model-
mean response is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the 5–95% spread across model projections. 
The spread in CO2 concentration, compared with the prescribed default concentration, leads to a very small 
increase by about 0.1°C in the spread of GSAT projections, but it is not possible to tell if this is a direct 
consequence of the simulation configuration or internal variability of the model simulations. These 
differences due to experimental configuration would be smaller still under scenarios with lower CO2 levels, 
and so we assess that results from concentration-driven and emissions-driven configurations do not affect the 
assessment of GSAT projections (high confidence). 
 
<figref>4.3</figref>
 
 
### 4.3.1.2  Precipitation 
 
AR5 assessed from CMIP5 projections that global mean precipitation over the 21st century will increase by 
more than 0.05 mm day–1 (about 2% of global precipitation) and 0.15 mm day–1 (about 5% of global 
precipitation) under the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively (Collins et al., 2013). These changes are 
generally in line with those from the CMIP6 simulations following SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 (see Table 4.3). 
 
Unlike AR5, our focus here is on land rather than global precipitation because land precipitation has greater 
societal relevance. These are displayed as percent changes relative to 1995–2014 (see Figure 4.2b).  Based 
on these results, we conclude that global land precipitation is larger during the period 2081–2100 than during 
the period 1995–2014, under all scenarios considered here (see Table 4.3: high confidence). Global land 
precipitation for 2081–2100, relative to 1995–2014, shows a 5–95% range of –0.2–4.7% under SSP1-1.9 and 
0.9–12.9% under SSP5-8.5, respectively. The corresponding ranges under the other emission scenarios are 
0.0–6.6% (SSP1-2.6), 1.5–8.3% (SSP2-4.5), and 0.5–9.6% (SSP3-7.0). A detailed assessment of 
hydrological sensitivity, or change in precipitation per degree warming, can be found in Chapter 8, Section 
8.2.1.  
 
For scenarios where unanimity across all of the model simulations that GSAT change relative to 1850–1900 
rises above 1.5°C (SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, or SSP5-8.5), the ensemble-mean change in global land precipitation 
from 1850–1900 until the time of exceedance is on average about 1.6%. For scenarios with unanimous 
global warming above 2.0°C (SSP3-7.0, or SSP5-8.5) and 3.0°C (SSP5-8.5), the ensemble-mean increase in 
global land precipitation for those models that do exceed 2.0°C and 3.0°C is on average about 2.6% and 
4.9%, respectively. On average under SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6, the global land precipitation change for 
simulations where global warming exceeds 1.5°C and 2.0°C will be about 1.9% and 3.0%, respectively. 
 
<tableref>4.3</tableref> 
 
Relative to 1995–2014, and across all of the scenarios considered here, CMIP6 models show greater 
increases in precipitation over land than either globally or over the ocean (see Table 4.3; high confidence). 
Over the Northern Hemisphere Extratropics, the 5–95% changes in precipitation over land between 1995–
2014 and 2021–2040, 2041–2060, and 2081–2100, following SSP5-8.5, are 0.6–4.9%, 1.5–8.8%, and 4.7–
17.2%, respectively (Figure 4.4). At the other end of scenario spectrum, SSP1-1.9, the corresponding 
changes are 0.6–5.4%, 0.6–7.3%, and 0.2–7.7%, respectively. By contrast, over the North Atlantic 
subtropics, precipitation decreases by about 10% following SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8. There is no change in 
subtropical precipitation in the North Atlantic following SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, or SSP2-4.5 (high confidence); 
thereby highlighting the potential limitations of pattern scaling for regional hydrological changes (see also 
Section 8.5.3). The reasons for the opposing changes in these two regions are assessed in Chapter 8.

## 4.3.2  Cryosphere, Ocean, and Biosphere  
 
### 4.3.2.1  Arctic Sea Ice 
 
AR5 assessed from CMIP5 simulations that there will be year-round reductions of Arctic sea ice coverage by 
the end of this century (Collins et al., 2013). These range from 43% under RCP2.6 and 94% under RCP8.5 in 
September, and from 8% under RCP2.6 and 34% under RCP8.5 in March (medium confidence). Based on a 
five-member selection of CMIP5 models, AR5 further assessed that for RCP8.5, Arctic sea-ice coverage in 
September will drop below 1 million km2 and be practically ice free at some point between 2040 and 2060.  
SROCC further assessed that the probability of an ice-free Arctic in September for stabilized global warming 
of 1.5°C and 2.0°C is approximately 1% and 10–35%, respectively (IPCC, 2019). 
 
With regards to the model selection in AR5, model evaluation studies have since identified shortcomings of 
the CMIP5 models to match the observed distribution of sea-ice thickness in the Arctic (Stroeve et al., 2014; 
Shu et al., 2015) and the observed evolution of albedo on seasonal scales (Koenigk et al., 2014). It was also 
found that many models’ deviation from observed sea ice cover climatology cannot be explained by internal 
variability, whereas the models’ deviation from observed sea ice cover trend (over the satellite period) can 
often be explained by internal variability (Olonscheck and Notz, 2017). This hinders a selection of models 
according to their simulated trends, which additionally has been shown to only have a weak effect on the 
magnitude of simulated future trends (Stroeve and Notz, 2015).  
 
Based on results from the CMIP6 models, we conclude that on average the Arctic will become practically 
ice-free in September by the end of the 21st century under SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 (see Figure 
4.2c and Table 4.4; high confidence). Also, in the CMIP6 models, Arctic SIA in March decreases in the 
future, but to a much lesser degree, in percentage terms, than in September (Table 4.4; high confidence). A 
more detailed assessment of projected Arctic and also Antarctic sea ice change can be obtained in Chapter 9, 
Section 9.3.1. 
 
<tableref>4.4</tableref> 
 
Studies focusing on the relationship of sea-ice extent and changes in external drivers have consistently found 
a much-reduced likelihood of a practically ice-free Arctic Ocean during summer for global warming of 1.5°C 
than for 2.0°C (Screen and Williamson, 2017; Jahn, 2018; Niederdrenk and Notz, 2018; Notz and Stroeve, 
2018; Sigmond et al., 2018; Olson et al., 2019). This is shown here in a large initial-condition ensemble of 
observationally constrained model simulations where GSAT are stabilized at 1.5°C, 2.0°C and 3.0°C 
warming relative to 1850–1900 in the RCP8.5 scenario (Figure 4.5). Temperature stabilization is achieved 
by switching off all the anthropogenic emissions around the time that GSAT first reaches the stabilization 
thresholds.  Simulations have been observationally constrained to correct for a model bias in simulated 
historical September sea-ice extent. In these simulations, Arctic sea ice coverage in September is simulated, 
on average, to drop below 1 million km2 around 2040, consistent with the AR5 set of assessed models 
(Sigmond et al., 2018). The individual model simulations, for which there are twenty for each stabilized 
temperature level, show that the probability of the Arctic becoming practically ice free at the end of the 21st 
century is significantly higher for 2°C warming than for 1.5°C warming above 1850–1900 levels (high 
confidence).  

<figref>4.5</figref> 
 
### 4.3.2.2  Global Mean Sea Level 
 
AR5 assessed from CMIP5 process-based simulations that the rate of GMSL rise during the 21st century will 
very likely exceed the rate observed during 1971–2010 for all RCP scenarios due to increases in ocean 
warming and loss of mass from glaciers and ice sheets (Church et al., 2013). Further, AR5 concluded that for 
the period 2081–2100, compared to 1986–2005, GMSL rise is likely (medium confidence) to be in the 5–95% 
range of projections from process-based models, which give 0.26–0.55 m for RCP2.6, 0.32–0.63 m for 
RCP4.5, 0.33–0.63 m for RCP6.0, and 0.45–0.82 m for RCP8.5. For RCP8.5, the rise by 2100 is 0.52–0.98 
m with a rate during 2081–2100 of 8–16 mm yr-1. 
 
There have been substantial modelling advances since AR5, with most sea-level projections corresponding to 
one of three categories: 1) central-range projections, combining scenario-conditional probability distributions 
for the different contributions to estimate a central range under different scenarios; 2) probabilistic 
projections, which explicitly consider outcomes for a wide range of likelihoods, including low-likelihood 
high-impact outcomes, and 3) semi-empirical projections, based on statistical relationships between past 
GMSL changes and climate variables, which now calibrate individual contributions and are consistent with 
physical-model based estimates (Chapter 9, Section 9.6.3). 
 
Based on the assessment of the latest modelling information (see Figure 4.2d and Chapter 9, Section 9.6.3), 
we conclude that under the SSP3-7.0, the likely range of GMSL change averaged over 2081–2100 relative to 
1995–2014 is 0.46–0.74 m. Under SSP1-2.6, the likely range over the long-term is 0.30–0.54 m.  Further, in 
SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5, the rise in GMSL is projected to accelerate over the 21st century. A 
detailed assessment of the processes contributing to these projected rises and accelerations in GMSL, 
together with a comparison to AR5 and SROCC, can be found in Chapter 9, Section 9.6.3. Projected changes 
in the thermosteric component of GMSL beyond 2300 are assessed in Section 4.7.1. 
 
In summary, it is virtually certain that under any one of the assessed SSPs, there will be continued rise in 
GMSL through the 21st century.  
 
 
### 4.3.2.3  Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation 
 
AR5 assessed from CMIP5 simulations that the AMOC will very likely weaken over the 21st century, and 
the projected weakening of the AMOC is consistent with CMIP5 projections of an increase of high-latitude 
temperature and high-latitude precipitation, with both effects causing the surface waters at high latitudes to 
become less dense and therefore more stable (Collins et al., 2013). 
 
Based on CMIP6 models, we find that over the 21st century, AMOC strength, relative to 1995–2014, shows 
a multi-model mean decrease in each of the SSP scenarios but with a large spread across the individual 
simulations (Figure 4.6). We also note that the magnitude of the ensemble-mean strength decrease is 
approximately scenario independent up to about 2060 (Weijer et al., 2020). A more detailed assessment of 
these projected AMOC changes, and the mechanisms involved, can be found in Chapter 9, Section 9.2.3. 
 
In summary, we assess from the CMIP6 models that AMOC weakening over the 21st century is very likely; 
the rate of weakening is approximately independent of the emission scenario (high confidence).  
 
<figref>4.6</figref> 
 
Based on a large initial condition ensemble of simulations with a CMIP5 model (CanESM2) with emission 
scenarios leading to stabilization of global warming of 1.5°C, 2.0°C, or 3.0°C relative to 1850–1900, AMOC 
continues to decline for 5–10 years after GSAT is effectively stabilized at the given GWL (Sigmond et al., 
2020). This is followed by a recovery of AMOC strength for about the next 150 years to a level that is 
approximately independent of the considered stabilization scenario. These results are replicated in 
simulations in a CMIP6 model (CanESM5) with emissions cessation after diagnosed CO2 emissions reach 
750 Gt, 1000 Gt, or 1500 Gt. These emissions levels lead to global warming stabilization at 1.5°C, 2.0°C, or 
3.0°C relative to 1850–1900. In summary, in these model simulations the AMOC recovers over several 
centuries after the cessation of CO2 emissions (medium confidence). 
 
 
### 4.3.2.4  Ocean and Land Carbon Uptake 
 
AR5 concluded with very high confidence that ocean carbon uptake of anthropogenic CO2 will continue 
under all RCPs through the 21century, with higher uptake corresponding to higher concentration pathways. 
The future evolution of the land carbon uptake was assessed to be much more uncertain than for ocean 
carbon uptake, with a majority of CMIP5 models projecting a continued cumulative carbon uptake.  
 
Based on results from the CMIP6 models, we conclude that the flux of carbon from the atmosphere into the 
ocean increases continually through most of 21st century in the two highest emissions and decreases 
continually under the other emission scenarios (Figure 4.7a).  The flux of carbon from the atmosphere to 
land shows a similar 21st century behaviour across the scenarios but with much higher year-to-year variation 
than ocean carbon flux (Figure 4.7b). A more in-depth assessment and discussion of the mechanism involved 
can be found in Chapter 5, Section 5.4.5. 
 
In summary, we assess that the cumulative uptake of carbon by the ocean and by land will increase through 
the 21st century irrespective of the considered emission scenarios (very high confidence). 
 
<figref>4.7</figref> 
 
### 4.3.2.5  Surface Ocean pH 
 
AR5 assessed from CMIP5 simulations that it is virtually certain that increasing storage of carbon by the 
ocean under all four RCPs through to 2100 will increase ocean acidification in the future (Ciais et al., 2013). 
Specifically, AR5 reported that CMIP5 models project increased ocean acidification globally to 2100 under 
all RCPs, and that the corresponding model mean and model spread in the decrease in surface ocean pH from 
1986–2005 to 2081–2100 would be 0.065 (0.06–0.07) for RCP2.6, 0.145 (0.14–0.15) for RCP4.5, 0.203 
(0.20–0.21) for RCP6.0 and 0.31 (0.30–0.32) for RCP8.5.  
 
Based on results from the CMIP6 models we conclude that, except for the lower-emission scenarios SSP1-
1.9 and SSP1-2.6, ocean surface pH decreases monotonically through the 21st century (Figure 4.8; high 
confidence). 
 
<figref>4.8</figref>
 
## 4.3.3  Modes of Variability  
 
### 4.3.3.1  Northern and Southern Annular Modes 
 
#### Northern Annular Mode 
The Northern Annular Mode (NAM) is the leading mode of variability in the NH extratropical atmosphere 
(see Annex IV, Section AIV.2.1). Throughout this chapter, we use a simple fixed latitude-based NAM index 
defined as the difference in SLP between 35°N and 65°N (Li and Wang, 2003; Section AIV.2.1). The NAM 
index computed from the latitudinal gradient in SLP is strongly correlated with variations in the latitudinal 
position and strength of the mid-latitude westerly jets, and with the spatial distribution of Arctic sea ice 
(Caian et al., 2018). Projected changes in the position and strength of the mid-latitude westerly jets, storm 
tracks, and atmospheric blocking in both hemispheres are assessed in Section 4.5.1.6. AR5 referred to the 
NAM, and its synonym the Arctic Oscillation (AO), through its regional counterpart, the North Atlantic 
Oscillation (NAO). Here, we use the term NAM to refer also to the AO and NAO (see Section AIV.2.1), 
accepting that the AO and NAO are not identical entities. 
 
We first summarise the assessment of past NAM changes and their attribution from Chapters 2 and 3 to put 
into context the future projections described here. Strong positive trends for the NAM/NAO indices were 
observed since 1960, which have weakened since the 1990s (high confidence; Chapter 2, Section 2.4.1.1). 
The NAO variability in the instrumental record was likely not unusual in the millennial and multi-centennial 
context (Section 2.4.1.1). Climate models simulate the gross features of the NAM with reasonable fidelity, 
including its interannual variability, but models tend to systematically underestimate the amount of 
multidecadal variability of the NAM and jet stream compared to observations (Wang et al., 2017b; 
Bracegirdle et al., 2018; Simpson et al., 2018a); Chapter 3, Section 3.7.1), with the caveat of the 
observational record being relatively short to characterise decadal variability (Chiodo et al., 2019). A 
realistic simulation of the stratosphere and SST variability in the tropics and northern extratropics are 
important for a model to realistically capture the observed NAM variability. Despite some evidence from 
climate model studies that anthropogenic forcings influence the NAM, the balance of evidence indicates that 
there is little evidence for a significant role for anthropogenic forcings in driving the observed multidecadal 
variations of the NAM over the instrumental period (Section 3.7.1). 
 
AR5 assessed from CMIP5 simulations that the future boreal wintertime NAM is very likely to exhibit large 
natural variations and trends of similar magnitude to that observed in the past and is likely to become slightly 
more positive in the future (Collins et al., 2013). Based on CMIP6 model results displayed in Figure 4.9a, we 
conclude that the boreal wintertime surface NAM is more positive by the end of the 21st century under 
SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 (high confidence). For these high emission scenarios, the 5–95% range of NAM 
index anomalies averaged from 2081–2100 are 0.3–3.8 hPa and 0.32–5.2 hPa, respectively. On the other 
hand, under neither of the lowest emission scenarios, SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6, does the NAM show a robust 
change, by the end of the 21st century (high confidence). 
 
<figref>4.9</figref>  
 
Significant progress has been made since AR5 in understanding the physical mechanisms responsible for 
changes in the NAM, although uncertainties remain. It is now clear from the literature that the NAM 
response, and the closely-related response of the mid-latitude storm tracks, to anthropogenic forcing in 
CMIP5-era climate models is determined by a ‘tug-of-war’ between two opposing processes (Harvey et al., 
2014; Shaw et al., 2016a; Screen et al., 2018a); 1) Arctic amplification (see Section 4.5.1.1 and Chapter 7, 
Section 7.4.4.1), which decreases the low-level meridional temperature gradient, reduces baroclinicity on the 
poleward flank of the eddy-driven jet, and shifts the storm tracks equatorward and leading to a negative 
NAM (see Box 10.1; Harvey et al., 2015; Hoskins and Woollings, 2015; Peings et al., 2017; Screen et al., 
2018a); 2) and enhanced warming in the tropical upper-troposphere, due to GHG increases and associated 
water vapour and lapse rate feedbacks, which increases the upper-level meridional temperature gradient and 
causes a poleward shift of the storm tracks and a positive NAM (Harvey et al., 2014; Vallis et al., 2015; 
Shaw, 2019). The large diversity in projected NAM changes in CMIP5 multi-model ensemble (Gillett and 
Fyfe, 2013) appears to be at least partly explained by the relative importance of these two mechanisms in 
particular models (Harvey et al., 2014, 2015; Vallis et al., 2015; McCusker et al., 2017; Oudar et al., 2017). 
Models that produce larger Arctic amplification also tend to produce larger equatorward shifts of the mid-
latitude jets and associated negative NAM responses (Barnes and Polvani, 2015; Harvey et al., 2015; Zappa 
and Shepherd, 2017; McKenna et al., 2018; Screen et al., 2018a; Zappa et al., 2018). 
 
Another area of progress is new understanding the role of cloud radiative effects in shaping the mid-latitude 
circulation response to anthropogenic forcing. Through their non-uniform distribution of radiative heating, 
cloud changes can modify meridional temperature gradients and alter mid-latitude circulation and the 
annular modes in both hemispheres (Ceppi et al., 2014; Voigt and Shaw, 2015, 2016; Ceppi and Hartmann, 
2016; Ceppi and Shepherd, 2017; Lipat et al., 2018; Albern et al., 2019; Voigt et al., 2019). In addition to the 
effects of changing upper and lower tropospheric temperature gradients on the NAM, progress has been 
made since AR5 in understanding the effect of simulated changes in the strength of the stratospheric polar 
vortex on winter NAM projections (Manzini et al., 2014; Zappa and Shepherd, 2017; Simpson et al., 2018b).  

#### Southern Annular Mode 
The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is the leading mode of large-scale extratropical atmospheric variability 
in the SH and influences most of the southern extratropics (see Annex IV, Section AIV.2.2). In its positive 
phase, the SAM characterizes anomalously low pressure over the polar cap and high pressure in southern 
mid-latitudes (Marshall, 2003). While there are some zonal asymmetries to the structure of the SAM (see 
Section AIV.2.2), it is more symmetric than its NH counterpart (Fyfe et al., 1999). Throughout this chapter, 
we use a simple fixed latitude-based SAM index defined as the difference in zonal mean SLP between 40°S 
and 65°S (Gong and Wang, 1999) (see Section AIV.2.2 for discussion of other SAM indices). Although the 
SAM is often used as a proxy for the location of the mid-latitude westerly wind belt, trends in the SAM can 
reflect a combination of changes in jet position, width, and strength. The changes in the SH circulation 
associated with the SAM influence on surface wind stress (Wang et al., 2014) and hence affect the Southern 
Ocean. 
 
Over the instrumental period, there has been a robust positive trend in the SAM index, particularly since 
1970 (high confidence; Chapter 2, Section 2.4.1.2). There is medium confidence that the recent trend in the 
SAM is unprecedented in the past several Centuries (Section 2.4.1.2). There is high confidence that 
stratospheric ozone depletion and GHG increases have contributed to the positive SAM trend during the late 
20th century, with ozone depletion dominating in austral summer, following the peak of the Antarctic ozone 
hole in September–October, and GHG increases dominating in other seasons (Chapter 3, Section 3.7.2). To 
capture the effects of stratospheric ozone changes on the SAM, climate models must include a realistic 
representation of ozone variations (Section 3.7.2). In models that do not explicitly represent stratospheric 
ozone chemistry, which includes the majority of the CMIP6 model ensemble, an ozone dataset is prescribed. 
To properly capture the effects of ozone depletion and recovery on the stratosphere and surface climate, the 
prescribed ozone dataset must realistically capture observed stratospheric ozone trends with sufficiently high 
temporal resolution (Neely et al., 2014; Young et al., 2014). The CMIP6 experiment protocol recommended 
the use of a prescribed 4-D monthly mean ozone concentration field for models without stratospheric 
chemistry (Eyring et al., 2016).  
 
AR5 assessed that the positive trend in the austral summer/autumn SAM observed since 1970 (see Section 
2.4.1.2) is likely to weaken considerably as stratospheric ozone recovers through the mid-21st century, while 
in other seasons the SAM changes depend on the emission scenario, with a larger increase in SAM for higher 
emission scenarios. In CMIP6 models, the austral summer SAM is more positive by the end of the 21st 
century under SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 (Figure 4.9b). On the other hand, under SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6, the 
SAM is projected to be less positive, especially under SSP1-1.9 where the 5–95% ranges of anomalies 
relative to 1995–2014 are –3.1 to 0.0 hPa averaged from 2081–2100. In summary, under the highest 
emission scenarios in the CMIP6 models, the SAM in the austral summer becomes more positive through the 
21st century (high confidence). 
 
 
### 4.3.3.2  El Niño-Southern Oscillation  
 
ENSO is the most dominant mode of variability on interannual timescales and also the dominant source of 
seasonal climate predictability (Timmermann et al., 2018; see Chapter 11, Box 11.3 and Annex IV, Section 
AIV.2.3). AR5 assessed from CMIP5 simulations that ENSO variability will very likely remain the dominant 
mode of interannual climate variability in the future, and that associated ENSO precipitation variability on 
regional scales is likely to intensify (Christensen et al., 2013). However, they assessed there was low 
confidence in projected changes in ENSO variability in the 21st century due to a strong component of 
internal variability. 
 
<figref>4.10</figref> 
 
Among a range of indices proposed for representing ENSO, we use the most prominent one, the Niño 3.4 
index, defined as the average equatorial SST or precipitation across the central equatorial Pacific (5°S–5°N, 
170°W–120°W) (see Section AIV.2.3). Here, we consider the evolution of the amplitude of Niño3.4 index 
for SST and precipitation over the 21st century as projected by CMIP6 models. Analysis of CMIP6 models 
shows there is no robust model consensus on the forced changes in the amplitude of ENSO SST variability 
even under the high-emission scenarios SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, but a significant increasing trend in the 
amplitude of ENSO precipitation variability is projected across the 21st century in the four SSPs (Figure 
4.10). This is broadly consistent with results from CMIP5 models (Christensen et al., 2013)(Power et al., 
2013)(Cai et al., 2015)(Chen et al., 2017)(Wengel et al., 2018), recent studies with CMIP6 models (Brown et 
al., 2020)(Fredriksen et al., 2020a)(Freund et al., 2020a)(Yun et al., 2021), and large initial-condition 
ensemble experiments (Maher et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2018; Haszpra et al., 2020). 
 
It is therefore very likely that the amplitude of ENSO rainfall variability will intensify in response to global 
warming over the 21st century although there is no robust consensus from CMIP6 climate models for a 
systematic change in amplitude of ENSO SST variability even in the high-emission scenarios of SSP3-7.0 
and SSP5-8.5.  
 
 
## 4.3.4  Synthesis Assessment of Projected Change in Global Surface Air Temperature  
 
GSAT change is assessed using multiple lines of evidence including the CMIP6 projection simulations out to 
year 2100. The assessment combines CMIP6 projections driven by SSP scenarios with observational 
constraints on simulated past warming (Brunner et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2020; Nijsse et al., 2020; Tokarska 
et al., 2020; Ribes et al., 2021) (see BOX 4.1 and Figure 4.11:a,b), as well as the AR6-updated assessment of 
ECS and TCR in Section 7.5. The approaches of (Liang et al., 2020; Tokarska et al., 2020; Ribes et al., 2021) 
have first been extended to all 20-year averaging periods between 2000 and 2100. For each 20-year period, 
the 5%, 50%, and 95% percentile GSAT values of these three constrained CMIP6 results are averaged 
percentile by percentile (Figure 4.11c). Then, an emulator based on a two-layer energy balance model (e.g., 
Held et al., 2010) is driven by the Chapter 7-derived ERF. The emulator parameters are chosen such that the 
central estimate, lower bound of the very likely range, and upper bound of the very likely range of climate 
feedback parameter and ocean heat uptake coefficient take the values that map onto the corresponding 
combination of ECS (3°C, 2°C, and 5°C, respectively) and TCR (1.8°C, 1.2°C, and 2.4°C, respectively) of 
Section 7.5 (see Box 4.1). As a final step, the constrained-CMIP6 and the emulator-based 5%, 50%, and 95% 
percentile GSAT values are averaged percentile by percentile (Figure 4.11c, d; Table 4.5). Constrained 
CMIP6 results and the ECS- and TCR-based emulator thus contribute one-half each to the GSAT 
assessment. Because the emulator results and (Ribes et al., 2021) represent the forced response only, and 
averaging over the other two individual estimates (Liang et al., 2020; Tokarska et al., 2020) further reduces 
the contribution from internal variability, the assessed GSAT time series are assumed to represent purely the 
forced response.  
 
Averaged over the period 2081–2100, GSAT is very likely to be higher than in the recent past (1995–2014) 
by 0.3°C–0.9°C in the low-emission scenario SSP1-1.9 and by 2.6°C–4.7°C in the high-emission scenario 
SSP5-8.5. For the scenarios SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP3-7.0, the corresponding very likely ranges are 
0.6°C–1.4°C, 1.3°C–2.5°C, and 2.0°C–3.8°C, respectively (Figure 4.11, Table 4.5). Because the different 
approaches for estimating long-term GSAT change produce consistent results (Figure 4.11), there is high 
confidence in this assessment. These ranges of the long-term projected GSAT change generally correspond 
to AR5 ranges for related scenarios but the likelihood is increased to very likely ranges, in contrast to the 
likely ranges in AR5. Over the mid-term period 2041–2060, the very likely GSAT ranges of SSP1-1.9 and 
SSP5-8.5 are almost completely distinct (Table 4.5, high confidence, see also Section 4.3.1). 
 
CMIP6 models project a wider range of GSAT change than the assessed range (high confidence, see Section 
4.3.1). The CMIP6 models with a higher climate sensitivity simulate warming rates higher than assessed very 
likely here (see Section 4.3.1); these rates are very unlikely but not impossible to occur and hence cannot be 
excluded. The implications of these very unlikely warming rates for patterns of surface temperature and 
precipitation change are assessed in Section 4.8.  
 
For the near term, initialized decadal forecasts constitute another line of evidence over the period 2019–2028 
(see Box 4.1). The forecasts are consistent with the assessed GSAT very likely range (Box 4.1, Figure 1), 
strengthening the confidence in the near-term assessment.  
 
<figref>4.11</figref> 
 
The assessed ranges of GSAT change can be converted to change relative to mean GSAT over the period 
1850–1900 for a consistent comparison with AR5 (IPCC, 2013) and SR1.5 (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2018). 
GSAT was warmer in 1995–2014 (recent past) than 1850–1900 by 0.85°C [0.67–0.98°C]. GSAT diagnosed 
for 1986–2005 (AR5 recent past) relative to 1850–1900 is 0.08°C higher than was diagnosed in AR5, due to 
methodological and dataset updates (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3, Table 1).  
 
The uncertainty in GSAT relative to 1850–1900 includes the very likely ranges of assessed GSAT change 
relative to 1995–2014 (depending on scenario and period, between 0.5°C and 2.4°C, Figure 4.11d, Table 
4.5), the uncertainty in historical GSAT change from the mean over 1850–1900 to 1995–2014 (about 0.3°C, 
Cross-Chapter Box 2.3), and the estimate of internal variability in 20-year GSAT averages (5–95% range 
about 0.15°C, Box 4.1, (Maher et al., 2019a)). These uncertainties are assumed to be independent and are 
added in quadrature, meaning that the total uncertainty is only slightly larger than the dominating 
contribution by the GSAT change relative to 1995–2014 (Table 4.5). The addition is done by numerically 
sampling a normal distribution fitted to the 5%, 50%, and 95% percentiles of the internal variability, as well 
as sampling skew-normal distributions (e.g., O’Hagan and Leonard, 1976) fitted to the 5%, 50%, and 95% 
percentiles of both historical warming and GSAT relative to 1995–2014. The result is a joint probability 
distribution of GSAT change and 20-year period.  
 
Averaged over the period 2081–2100, GSAT is very likely to be higher than in the period 1850–1900 by 
1.0°C–1.8°C in the low-emission scenario SSP1-1.9 and by 3.3°C–5.7°C in the high-emission scenario 
SSP5-8.5. For the scenarios SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP3-7.0, the corresponding very likely ranges are 
1.3°C–2.4°C, 2.1°C–3.5°C, and 2.8°C–4.6°C, respectively (Table 4.5).  

Time series of assessed GSAT change are now used to assess the time when certain thresholds of GSAT 
increase are crossed (Table 4.5). The threshold-crossing time is defined as the midpoint of the first 20-year 
period during which the average GSAT exceeds the threshold. During the near term (2021–2040), a 1.5°C 
increase in the 20-year average of GSAT, relative to the average over the period 1850–1900, is very likely to 
occur in scenario SSP5-8.5, likely to occur in scenarios SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0, and more likely than not to 
occur in scenarios SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6. In all scenarios assessed here except SSP5-8.5, the central 
estimate of crossing the 1.5°C threshold lies in the early 2030s, about ten years earlier than the midpoint of 
the likely range (2030–2052) assessed in the SR1.5, which assumed continuation of the then-current warming 
rate. Roughly half of this ten-year difference arises from a larger historical warming diagnosed in AR6, 
while the other half arises because for central estimates of climate sensitivity, most scenarios show stronger 
warming over the near term than was estimated as ‘current’ in SR1.5 (medium confidence); this estimate has 
been confirmed in AR6 (Section 3.3.1).  If ECS and TCR lie near the lower end of the assessed very likely 
range, crossing the 1.5°C warming threshold is avoided in scenarios SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 (medium 
confidence). It is more likely than not that under SSP1-1.9, GSAT relative to 1850–1900 will remain below 
1.6°C throughout the 21st century, implying a potential temporary overshoot above 1.5°C of no more than 
0.1°C. All statements about crossing the 1.5°C threshold assume that no major volcanic eruption occurs 
during the near term.  
 
A warming level of 2°C in GSAT, relative to the period 1850–1900, is very likely to be crossed in the mid-
term period 2041–2060 under SSP5-8.5, likely to be crossed in the mid-term period under SSP3-7.0, and 
more likely than not to be crossed during the mid-term period under SSP2-4.5. During the entire 21st 
century, a warming level of 2°C in GSAT, relative to the period 1850–1900, will be crossed under SSP5-8.5 
and SSP3-7.0, will extremely likely be crossed under SSP2-4.5, will unlikely be crossed under SSP1-2.6, and 
will extremely unlikely be crossed under SSP1-1.9.

# 4.4  Near-term Global Climate Changes  
 
This section assesses changes in large-scale climate over the period 2021–2040 and includes information 
from both projections and initialized decadal predictions. The structure is similar to Section 4.3. Unless 
noted otherwise, the assessment assumes that there will be no major volcanic eruption in the near term. The 
climatic effects of volcanic eruptions are assessed in Section 4.4.4 and Cross-Chapter Box 4.1; Section 4.4.4 
also assesses the climate effects of short-lived climate forcers.  
 
 
## 4.4.1  Atmosphere  
 
### 4.4.1.1 Average Global Surface Air Temperature 
 
AR5 assessed that it is likely that GSAT will increase in the range 0.3°C–0.7°C over the period 2016–2035 
relative to 1986–2005 (medium confidence), and that there were not large differences in the GSAT change 
among different RCPs in this period (Kirtman et al., 2013). AR5 further assessed that it is more likely than 
not that the mean GSAT for the period 2016–2035 will be more than 1°C above the mean for 1850–1900, 
and it is very unlikely that it will be more than 1.5°C above the 1850–1900 mean (medium confidence). It 
was shown that in the period 2016–2035, differences in GSAT across RCP scenarios for a single climate 
model are typically smaller than differences between climate models under a single RCP scenario, indicating 
that model structural uncertainty is larger than scenario uncertainty over that period (Hawkins and Sutton, 
2009). 
 
Near-term (2021–2040) GSAT changes relative to 1995–2014 exhibit only minor dependence on SSP 
scenario, consistent with AR5 (Table 4.5). Averaged over the twenty years of the near term and across all 
scenarios, GSAT is very likely to be higher than over 1995–2014 by 0.4°C–1.0°C (Table 4.5), with most of 
the uncertainty arising from that in ECS and TCR (high confidence, e.g., Lehner et al., 2020, Section 4.3.4). 
The assessed near-term warming is thus larger than in AR5 by 0.1°C to 0.2°C. This upward revision has the 
same magnitude as the ad-hoc downward adjustment to near-term projected GSAT change that was 
performed in AR5 ((Kirtman et al., 2013); see Box 4.1).   
 
Averaged near-term GSAT is as likely as not at least 1.5°C higher than during 1850–1900, across the five 
SSP scenarios used here (Table 4.5, see Section 4.3.4). This much higher likelihood of near-term warming 
reaching 1.5°C than in AR5 arises both because surface warming has continued since AR5 (the period 1995–
2014 was warmer by 0.16°C than 1986–2005, Cross-Chapter Box 2.3, Table 1), and because of 
methodological and dataset updates (the AR6 assessment of 1986–2005 GSAT change relative to 1850–1900 
is 0.08°C higher than in the AR5; Cross-Chapter Box 2.3, Table 1).  
 
For annual-mean GSAT, uncertainty in near-term projections arises in roughly equal measure from internal 
variability and model uncertainty (high confidence, Box 4.1). Forecasts initialized from recent observations 
simulate GSAT changes for the period 2019–2028 relative to the recent past that are consistent with the 
assessed very likely range in annual-mean GSAT (Box 4.1, Figure 1, Table 4.5, high confidence). Because 
annual mean GSAT shows a higher level of internal variability than the 20-year mean, individual years are 
expected to cross the 1.5°C earlier than the assessed GSAT does. For example, Smith et al. (2018) apply a 
multi-model decadal-forecast ensemble to assess the likelihood that global warming of 1.5°C higher than 
over 1850–1900 will be temporarily exceeded in the near future.  
 
When we repeat the uncertainty quantification for GSAT as in Section 4.3.4 but with the corresponding 
higher level of internal variability for annual instead of 20-year averages added in quadrature, we can 
estimate the likelihood that an individual year would cross the GSAT 1.5°C threshold. By 2030, GSAT in 
any individual year could exceed 1.5°C relative to 1850–1900 with a likelihood between 40 and 60 percent, 
across the scenarios considered here (medium confidence). 

### 4.4.1.2 Spatial Patterns of Surface Warming 
 
Consistent with AR5 and earlier assessments, Figure 4.12 shows for SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0 that the largest 
warming occurs at high latitudes, particularly in boreal winter in the Arctic (see Section 4.5.1.1), and larger 
warming over land than over the ocean (see also Section 4.5.1.1). In both scenarios, the increase in seasonal 
mean surface temperatures over many NH land regions exceeds 1°C relative to 1995–2014. In the near term, 
the two scenarios show surface temperature changes that are similar in magnitude. The trajectories for well-
mixed GHGs, and as a consequence the effective radiative forcing, in the scenarios have not yet diverged 
that much (O’Neill et al., 2016; Riahi et al., 2017). Based on the currently available CMIP6 models, regions 
that do not show robust warming in the near-term include the northern North Atlantic, parts of India, parts of 
North America and Eurasia in winter, and the subtropical eastern Pacific in the Southern Hemisphere.  
 
<figref>4.12</figref> 
 
The ERF patterns from aerosols and well-mixed GHGs are distinct (Chapter 7), and warming patterns 
therefore depend on the precise mix of forcing agents in the scenarios. The spatial efficacies – the change in 
surface temperature per unit ERF – for CO2, sulphate and black carbon aerosols and solar forcing have been 
recently evaluated in climate models (Modak et al., 2016; Duan et al., 2018; Modak et al., 2018a; Modak and 
Bala, 2019; Richardson et al., 2019). On average, the spatial patterns of near-surface warming are largely 
similar for different external drivers (Xie et al., 2013; Richardson et al., 2019; Samset et al., 2020), despite 
the patterns of forcing being different and large spread across different models (Richardson et al., 2019). 
 
Internal variability in near-surface temperature change is large in many regions, particularly in mid-latitudes 
and polar regions (Hawkins and Sutton, 2012). Projections from individual realizations can therefore exhibit 
divergent regional responses in the near-term in areas where the amplitude of a forced signal is relatively 
small compared to internal variability (Deser et al., 2012b, 2014, 2016). 
 
 
### 4.4.1.3  Precipitation 
 
AR5 assessed that zonal mean precipitation will very likely increase in high and some of the mid latitudes 
and will more likely than not decrease in the subtropics. AR5 further assessed that the near-term changes in 
precipitation are largely uncertain at regional scales, and much of the non-robustness in near-term 
projections is attributable to internal variability and model uncertainty.  
 
The mean patterns of seasonal precipitation change in CMIP6 models are consistent with AR5, increasing at 
high latitudes, over oceanic regions, and in wet regions over the tropics; and decreasing in dry regions 
including large parts of the subtropics (Figure 4.13). The magnitude of projected changes in precipitation in 
the near term, especially on regional scales is small compared to the magnitude of internal variability 
(Hawkins and Sutton, 2011, 2016; Hoerling et al., 2011; Deser et al., 2012b; Power et al., 2012) (see Section 
10.4.3). Analyses of CMIP5, CMIP6, and single-model large-ensemble simulations show that for the 
uncertainty in near-term precipitation projections, model uncertainty and internal variability dominate while 
the scenario uncertainty is very small (Lehner et al., 2020)(also see Section 8.5). Based on large ensembles 
of climate change experiments, it was shown that internal variability decreases over time for both 
temperature and precipitation on decadal scales  (Zhang and Delworth, 2018; Tebaldi et al., 2021). The 
precipitation projections from CMIP6 models shows larger model uncertainty associated with the higher 
average transient climate response (Lehner et al., 2020).  
 
The ‘wet get wetter, dry get drier’ paradigm, which  has been used to explain the global precipitation pattern 
responding to global warming (Held and Soden, 2006a), might not hold, especially over subtropical land 
regions (Greve et al., 2014; Feng and Zhang, 2015; Greve and Seneviratne, 2015). Over the tropical oceans, 
precipitation changes are largely driven by the pattern of SST changes (He et al., 2018), and in the 
subtropics, precipitation response is driven primarily by the fast adjustment to CO2 forcing (He and Soden, 
2017). In addition to the response to GHG forcing, forcing from natural and anthropogenic aerosols exert 
impacts on regional patterns of precipitation (Ramanathan et al., 2005; Bollasina et al., 2011; Polson et al., 
2014; Krishnan et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018b; Shawki et al., 2018) (also see Section 10.3.1). The large 
uncertainties in near-term regional precipitation projections arise due to the interplay between internal 
variability and anthropogenic external forcing  (Endo et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2021). Uncertainties in future 
aerosol emission scenarios contribute to uncertinites in regional precipitation projections (Wilcox et al., 
2020). Aerosol changes induce a drying in the SH tropical band compensated by wetter conditions in the NH 
counterpart (Acosta Navarro et al., 2017). The spatially uneven distribution of the aerosol forcing may also 
induce changes in tropical precipitation caused by shifts in the mean location of the intertropical 
convergence zone (ITCZ) (Hwang et al., 2013; Ridley et al., 2015; Voigt et al., 2017). Because of the large 
uncertainty in the aerosol radiative forcing and the dynamical response to the aerosol forcing there is medium 
confidence in the impacts of aerosols on near-term projected changes in precipitation. Precipitation changes 
in the near term show seasonal amplification, precipitation increase in the rainy season and decrease in the 
dry season (Fujita et al., 2019).  
 
<figref>4.13</figref> 
 
Consistent with AR5, we conclude that projected changes of seasonal mean precipitation in the near term 
will increase at high latitudes. Near-term projected changes in precipitation are uncertain mainly because of 
natural internal variability, model uncertainty, and uncertainty in natural and anthropogenic aerosol forcing 
(medium confidence). 
 
 
### 4.4.1.4  Global Monsoon Precipitation and Circulation  

The global monsoon is a forced response of the coupled atmosphere-land-ocean system to the annual cycle 
of solar insolation and characterized by a seasonal reversal of circulation and a seasonal alternation of dry 
and wet conditions (see Chapter 8, Section 8.3.2, Figure 8.11; Annex V). The global monsoon concept helps 
to dissect the mechanisms and controlling factors of monsoon variability at various temporal-spatial scales 
(Wang and Ding, 2008; Wang et al., 2017c).  
 
<figref>4.14</figref> 
 
In AR5, there was no specific assessment on global monsoon changes in the near term, but information can 
be derived from CMIP5 projections of the spatial patterns of precipitation change. While the basic pattern of 
wet regions including global monsoon regions tending to get wetter and dry regions tending to get drier is 
apparent, large response uncertainty is evident in the substantial spread in the magnitude of projected change 
simulated by different simulations. Over the global land monsoon regions, model uncertainty and internal 
variability together explain 99.7% of the fraction of total variance (Zhou et al. 2020), near-term projected 
multi-model mean precipitation changes are almost everywhere smaller than the estimated standard deviation 
of internal variability (Figure 4.13). 
 
The global land monsoon precipitation index, defined as the area-weighted precipitation rate in the global 
land monsoon domain, tends to increase in the near term under all five core SSPs (Figure 4.14a) (Chen et al., 
2020), but changes are small compared to the intermodel spread in the historical period. The Northern 
Hemisphere summer monsoon circulation index, defined as the vertical shear of zonal winds between 850 
and 200 hPa averaged in a zone stretching from Mexico eastward to the Philippines (0°–20°N, 120°W–
120°E), tends to decrease under four of the five SSP scenarios (Figure 4.14b), potentially offsetting monsoon 
precipitation increase. Projected changes in the global monsoon circulation are also uncertain influenced by 
internal variability and structural differences across models. In the near-term, for CMIP6 projections (Figure 
4.14a), the multi-model mean (5–95% range) of global land monsoon precipitation change is 1.9% (–0.4–
4.9%), 1.6% (–1.0–5.2%), 1.3% (–1.7–3.7%), and 1.9% (–0.8–5.2%) under SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, 
and SSP5-8.5, respectively.  
 
In summary, we assess that near-term changes in global monsoon precipitation and circulation will be 
affected by the combined effects of model uncertainty and internal variability, which together are larger than 
the forced signal (medium confidence). 
 
 
## 4.4.2  Cryosphere, Ocean, and Biosphere  
 
### 4.4.2.1  Arctic Sea Ice 
 
AR5 assessed that for RCP8.5, Arctic sea-ice coverage in September will drop below 1 million km2, or 
become practically ice-free, at some point between 2040 and 2060 (Collins et al., 2013).  Since AR5, there 
has been substantial progress in understanding the response of Arctic sea ice to near-term changes in external 
forcing. In particular, it is very likely that different trajectories of the near-term evolution of anthropogenic 
forcing cause distinctly different likelihood ranges for very low sea-ice coverage to occur over the next two 
decades (Notz and Stroeve, 2018). For example, there is an unlikely drop of September Arctic sea-ice 
coverage to below 1 million km2 before 2040 for RCP 2.6, and a likely drop of September Arctic sea-ice 
coverage to below 1 million km2 before 2040 for RCP 8.5 (medium confidence given the single study). The 
much higher likelihood of a practically sea-ice free Arctic Ocean during summer before 2040 in RCP8.5 
compared to RCP2.6 is consistent with related studies assessed in SROCC that find a substantially increased 
likelihood of an ice-free Arctic Ocean for 2.0°C compared to 1.5°C mean global warming relative to pre-
industrial levels (Screen and Williamson, 2017; Jahn, 2018; Niederdrenk and Notz, 2018; Notz and Stroeve, 
2018; Sigmond et al., 2018; Olson et al., 2019). 

Based on results from CMIP6 models, we conclude that Arctic SIA will decrease in September in the near 
term (Figure 4.15, high confidence). In the case of 10-year trends ending in the near term, 79% of the 
simulations considered across all of the core SSPs project decreasing Arctic sea-ice area in September. Due 
to less of an influence from internal variability, this number rises to 98% in the case of 30-year trends. A 
more detailed assessment of near-term Arctic sea-ice changes can be found in Chapter 9, Section 9.3.1. A 
detailed assessment of Antarctic sea ice changes is in Chapter 9, Section 9.3.2. 

<figref>4.15</figref>

### 4.4.2.2  Ocean and Land Carbon flux 

Ocean carbon flux is both a key feature of the physical ocean in mitigating the rise of atmospheric CO2 and a 
driver of changes in the ocean biosphere, including changes in ocean acidity. Based on results from CMIP6 
models, we conclude that SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 all clearly lead to increasing 10-, 20-, and 30-
year trends in ocean carbon flux over the near term (Figure 4.16, high confidence). Increasing trends in ocean 
carbon flux are less obvious in the lower-emission scenarios. Ensemble-mean trends in land carbon flux over 
the near term are generally increasing, but these are unlikely to be detected given a large component of 
terrestrial variability combined with model uncertainty. A more detailed assessment is in Chapter 5 Section 
5.2.1. 

In summary, it is likely that ocean carbon flux will increase in the near term under the higher emission 
scenarios, while a large component of terrestrial variability makes it is unlikely that an increase in land 
carbon flux will be detected over this period. 

<figref>4.16</figref> 
 
## 4.4.3  Modes of Variability  
 
This subsection assesses the near-term evolution of the large-scale modes of climate variability. Assessment 
of the physical mechanisms and the individual feedbacks involved in the future change of each mode and 
their role on future regional climate variability are provided in Sections 8.4.2, 9.2.3, 10.1.3 and Cross-
Chapter Box 10.1. 
 
 
### 4.4.3.1 Northern and Southern Annular Modes

#### The Northern Annular Mode 

AR5 assessed from CMIP5 simulations that there is only medium confidence in near-term projections of a 
northward shift of NH storm track and westerlies, and an associated increase in the NAM index, because of 
the large response uncertainty and the potentially large influence of internal variability. A tendency in the 
near term towards a slightly more positive NAM in the three highest emission scenarios during boreal fall, 
winter, and spring is apparent in Figure 4.17a. However, in general the projected near-term multi-model 
mean change in the NAM is small in magnitude compared to the inter-model and/or multi-realization 
variability within the ensemble (Figure 4.17a and Deser et al., 2012; Barnes and Polvani, 2015; Deser et al., 
2017).  
 
<figref>4.17</figref> 
 
On seasonal to interannual timescales, there is new evidence since AR5 that initialized predictions show 
lower potential predictability for the boreal winter NAO than the correlation skill with respect to 
observations (Eade et al., 2014; Baker et al., 2018; Scaife and Smith, 2018; Athanasiadis et al., 2020). This 
has been referred to in the literature as a ‘signal-to-noise paradox’ and means that very large ensembles of 
predictions are needed to isolate the predictable component of the NAO. While the processes that contribute 
to predictability of the winter NAO on seasonal timescales may be distinct from the processes that drive 
multi-decadal trends, there is emerging evidence that initialized predictions also underrepresent the 
predictability of the winter NAO on decadal timescales (Smith et al., 2019b). Post-processing and 
aggregation of initialized predictions may therefore reveal significant skill for predicting the winter NAO on 
decadal timescales (Smith et al., 2020). Considering these new results since AR5, in the near-term it is likely 
that any anthropogenic forced signal in the NAM will be of comparable magnitude or smaller than natural 
internal variability in the NAM (medium confidence). 
 
#### The Southern Annular Mode

AR5 assessed that it is likely that increases in GHGs and the projected recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole 
will be the principal drivers of future SAM trends and that the positive trend in austral summer/autumn SAM 
observed over the past several decades (AR5 Chapter 2, Section 2.4.1.2) is likely to weaken considerably as 
stratospheric ozone recovers through to the mid-21st century. The effects of ozone depletion and recovery on 
the SH circulation primarily occur in austral summer, while GHGs influence the SH circulation year round 
(Gillett and Fyfe, 2013; Grise and Polvani, 2014b) and are therefore likely to be the dominant driver of 
projected circulation changes outside of austral summer (Gillett and Fyfe, 2013; Barnes et al., 2014; 
Solomon and Polvani, 2016). Based on current scenarios specifying future atmospheric decline of ozone 
depleting substances (World Meteorological Organization, 2011), chemistry-climate models project the 
Antarctic ozone hole in October to recover by around 2060 (Dhomse et al., 2018)(World Meteorological 
Organization, 2014)(WMO, 2018). Observational evidence since AR5 shows the onset of Antarctic ozone 
hole recovery (Solomon et al., 2016; WMO, 2018) that has been attributed to a pause in the summer SAM 
trend over the past couple of decades (Saggioro and Shepherd, 2019; Banerjee et al., 2020). In austral 
summer, ozone recovery and increasing GHGs will have opposing effects on the SAM over the next several 
decades (Barnes et al., 2014).  
 
Since AR5, there have been advances in understanding the role of internal climate variability for projected 
near-term SH circulation trends (Solomon and Polvani, 2016). A large initial-condition ensemble following 
the RCP4.5 emission scenario shows a monotonic positive SAM trend in austral winter. In austral summer, 
the SAM trend over the first half of the 21st century is weaker compared to the strongly positive trend 
observed and simulated over the late 20th century. In that model, the number of realizations required to 
identify a detectable change in decadal mean austral winter SAM index from a year 2000 reference state 
decreased to below five by around 2025–2030 (Solomon and Polvani, 2016). However, in DJF the same 
criterion is not met until the second half of the 21st century, owing to the near-term opposing effects of 
ozone recovery and GHGs on the austral-summer SAM. In austral summer, forced changes in the SAM 
index in the near-term are therefore likely to be smaller than changes due to internal variability (Figure 
4.17:b; Barnes et al., 2014; Solomon and Polvani, 2016). 
 
CMIP6 models show a tendency in the near-term towards a more positive SAM index especially in the 
austral winter (JJA; Figure 4.17b). In all seasons, the differences between the central estimates of the change 
in the SAM index for each SSP are much smaller than the inter-model ensemble spread. The number of 
CMIP6 realizations in Figure 4.17b is larger than the suggested threshold of five realizations needed to 
detect a significant near-term change in decadal-mean austral winter SAM index for a single CMIP5 model 
(Solomon and Polvani, 2016), and yet the 5–95% intervals on the CMIP6 ensemble spread encompass zero 
for all core SSPs. This suggests both internal variability and model uncertainty contribute to the CMIP6 
ensemble spread in near-term SAM index changes. Based on these results, it is more likely than not that in 
the near-term under all assessed SSP scenarios the SAM index would become more positive than in present-
day in austral autumn, winter and spring. 
 
An influence of forcing agents other than stratospheric ozone and GHGs, such as anthropogenic aerosols, on 
SAM changes over the historical period has been reported in some climate models (Rotstayn, 2013), but the 
response across a larger set of CMIP5 models is not robust (Steptoe et al., 2016) and depends on how 
tropospheric temperature response to aerosols (Choi et al., 2019). This gives low confidence in the potential 
influence of anthropogenic aerosols on the SAM in the future. 
 
 
### 4.4.3.2  El Niño-Southern Oscillation  
 
AR5 assessed that it is very likely that the ENSO will remain the dominant mode of interannual variability in 
the future but did not specify its change in near term. A subset of CMIP5 models that simulate the ENSO 
Bjerknes index most realistically show an increase of ENSO SST amplitude in the near-term future and 
decline thereafter (Kim et al., 2014). However, detection of robust near-term changes of ENSO SST 
variability in response to anthropogenic forcing is difficult to achieve due to pronounced unforced low-
frequency modulations of ENSO (Wittenberg, 2009; Maher et al., 2018; Wengel et al., 2018). Figure 4.10 in 
Section 4.3.3.2 using CMIP6 models also shows no robust change in ENSO SST variability in the near term.   
 
While there is no strong model consensus on the change in amplitude of ENSO SST variability, the 
amplitude of ENSO-associated rainfall variability likely increases (Power et al., 2013; Cai et al., 2015). 
Analysis of CMIP6 models shows a slight increasing trend in amplitude of rainfall variability over Niño3.4 
region in the near term attributable to mean moisture increase, regardless of changes in ENSO SST 

variability (Figure 4.10) However, there are no distinguishable changes in the rainfall variability among four 
SSPs with significant model spread in the near term. Hence, no robust change in amplitude of ENSO SST 
and rainfall variability is expected in the near term although the rainfall variability slightly increases 
(medium confidence).  
 
 
### 4.4.3.3 Indian Ocean Basin and Dipole Modes
 
Important modes of interannual climate variability with pronounced climate impacts in the Africa-Indo-
Pacific areas of the globe are the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), which is closely related to- and often coincides 
with ENSO phases (Stuecker et al., 2017), and the Indian Ocean Basin (IOB) mode, which is often described 
as a capacitor effect in response to ENSO (Xie et al., 2009; Du et al., 2013) and can feed back onto ENSO 
evolution (Cai et al., 2019a). IOD and IOB are extensively described in Annex IV, Section AIV2.4. 
 
The projected climate mean state changes in the tropical Indian Ocean resemble a positive IOD state, with 
faster warming in the west compared to the east. This mean state change will potentially lead to a reduction 
in the amplitude of IOD events, albeit with no robust change in IOD frequency (Cai et al., 2014b). There is 
no robust evidence yet suggesting a cessation of IOD variability or a significant change in the IOB mode in 
the near-term. 
 
 
### 4.4.3.4 Tropical Atlantic Modes
 
Interannual variability of the tropical Atlantic can be described in terms of two main climate modes: the 
Atlantic Equatorial Mode and the Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM) (Annex IV, Section AIV2.5). The 
Atlantic Equatorial Mode, also commonly referred to as the Atlantic Niño or Atlantic Zonal Mode, is 
associated with SST anomalies near the equator, peaking in the eastern basin, while the AMM is 
characterized by an inter-hemispheric gradient of SST and wind anomalies. Both modes are associated with 
changes in the ITCZ and related winds and exert a strong influence on the climate in adjacent and remote 
regions. 
 
Despite considerable improvements in CMIP5 with respect to CMIP3, most CMIP5 models have difficulties 
in simulating the mean climate of the tropical Atlantic (Mohino et al., 2019) and are not able to correctly 
simulate the main aspects of Tropical Atlantic Variability (TAV) and associated impacts. This is presumably 
the main reason why there is a lack of specific studies dealing with near-term changes in tropical Atlantic 
modes. Nevertheless, AR5 reported that the ocean is more predictable than continental areas at the decadal 
timescale (Kirtman et al., 2013). In particular, the predictability in the tropical oceans is mainly associated 
with decadal variations of the external forcing component. Since the AMV affects the tropical Atlantic, near-
term variations of the AMV can modulate the Equatorial Mode and the AMM as well as associated impacts.  
 
There are no specific studies focusing on near-term changes in tropical Atlantic modes; nevertheless, decadal 
predictions show that although the North Atlantic stands out in most CMIP5 models as the primary region 
where skill might be improved because of initialization, encouraging results have also been found in the 
tropical Atlantic (Meehl et al., 2014). The effect of initialization in the tropical Atlantic is not only visible in 
surface temperature but also in the subsurface ocean (Corti et al., 2015). In particular, initialization improves 
the skill via remote ocean conditions in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre and tropical Pacific, which 
influence the tropical Atlantic through atmospheric teleconnections (Dunstone et al., 2011; Vecchi et al., 
2014; García-Serrano et al., 2015a). Improvements of some aspects of climate prediction systems 
(initialization techniques, large ensembles, increasing model resolution) have also led to skill improvements 
over the tropical Atlantic (Pohlmann et al., 2013; Monerie et al., 2017; Yeager and Robson, 2017). 
 
Recent studies have shown that the AMV can modulate not only the characteristics of the Atlantic Niños, but 
also their inter-basin teleconnections (Indian and Pacific). In particular, the Atlantic Niño–ENSO 
relationship is strongest during negative AMV phases (Martín-Rey et al., 2014; Losada and Rodríguez-
Fonseca, 2016) when equatorial Atlantic SST variability is enhanced (Martín-Rey et al., 2017; Lübbecke et 
al., 2018).  
 
Based on CMIP5 and available CMIP6 results, we conclude that there is a lack of studies on the near-term 
evolution of TAV and associated teleconnections for a comprehensive assessment. However, some studies 
show that despite severe model biases there are skilful predictions in the mean state of tropical Atlantic 
surface temperature several years ahead (medium confidence), though skill in simulated variability has not 
been assessed yet. Decadal changes in the Atlantic Niño spatial configuration and associated teleconnections 
might be modulated by the AMV, but there is limited evidence and therefore low confidence in these results.  
 
 
### 4.4.3.5  Pacific Decadal Variability  
 
Climate variability of the Pacific Ocean on decadal and interdecadal timescales is described in terms of a 
number of quasi-oscillatory SST patterns such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) (Mantua et al., 
1997) and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) (Folland, 2002), which are referred to as the Pacific 
Decadal Variability (PDV) (Newman et al., 2016). PDV comprises an inter-hemispheric pattern that varies at 
decadal-to-interdecadal timescales (see Chapter 3, Figure 3.35). However, although the spatial domains to 
derive the IPO and PDO indices differ, and despite uncertainty related to trend removal and time-filtering 
(Newman et al., 2016; Tung et al., 2019), the IPO and PDO are highly correlated in time and they will be 
assessed together as the PDV (see Annex IV, Section AIV.2.6). 
 
AR5 assessed that near-term predictions of PDV (then referred to as PDO or IPO) were largely model 
dependent (Mochizuki et al., 2012; van Oldenborgh et al., 2012), not robust to sampling of initialization 
start-dates, overall not statistically significant, and worse than persistence (Doblas-Reyes et al., 2013), 
although some studies showed positive skill for PDV (Mochizuki et al., 2010; Chikamoto et al., 2013). The 
CMIP5 decadal-prediction ensemble yielded no prediction skill of SST over the key PDV centres of action in 
the Pacific Ocean, both at 2–5 year and 6–9 year forecast averages (Doblas-Reyes et al., 2013; Guemas et al., 
2013; Boer and Sospedra-Alfonso, 2019).  
  
Since AR5, the processes causing the multi-decadal variability in the Pacific Ocean have become better 
understood (Newman et al., 2016)(Henley, 2017). However, the relative importance of tropical and 
extratropical processes underlying PDV remains unclear; although it seems to be stochastically driven rather 
than self-excited (Liu, 2012; Liu and Di Lorenzo, 2018), the South Pacific being a key region for the tropical 
branch of PDV (Chung et al., 2019; Liguori and Di Lorenzo, 2019). 
 
Because PDV represents not one, but many dynamical processes, it represents a challenge as a target for 
near-term climate predictions and projections. The new generation of decadal forecast systems keeps 
showing poor (Shaffrey et al., 2017) to moderate (Smith et al., 2019b) multi-year prediction skill for PDV,  
although the potential for forecasting capabilities is demonstrated in case studies (Meehl and Teng, 2012; 
Meehl et al., 2014). For the near-term, a transition of PDV from the negative phase (1999–2012) towards a 
positive phase is predicted in the coming years (2013-2022) (Meehl et al., 2016). 
 
The PDV has been shown to influence the pace of global warming (see Cross Chapter Box 3.1), but the 
extent to which PDV is externally forced or internally generated (Mann et al., 2020) remains an open 
question, and there is still no robust evidence. Thus, there is low confidence on how the PDV will evolve in 
the near-term (Bordbar et al., 2019). 
 
 
### 4.4.3.6  Atlantic Multidecadal Variability 
 
The Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (AMV) is a large-scale climate mode accounting for the main 
fluctuations in North Atlantic SST on multi-decadal timescales (Annex IV, Section AIV.2.7). The AMV 
influences air temperatures and precipitation over adjacent and remote continents, and its undulations can 
partially explain the observed variations in the NH mean temperatures (Steinman et al., 2015). The origin of 
this variability is still uncertain. Ocean dynamics (e.g., changes in the AMOC), external forcing, and local 
atmospheric forcing all seem to play a role (Menary et al., 2015; Ruprich-Robert and Cassou, 2015; Brown 
et al., 2016; Cassou et al., 2018; Wills et al., 2019). Recent studies have discussed that the ocean dynamics 
play an active role in generating AMV (Oelsmann et al., 2020) and its interplay with the NAO (Vecchi et al., 
2017; Zhang et al., 2019a; Kim et al., 2020), although natural and anthropogenic external forcing might be 
crucial in modulating its amplitude and timing (Bellucci et al., 2017)(Bellomo et al., 2018; Andrews et al., 
2020; Borchert et al., 2021)(Mann et al., 2021) (see Section 3.7.7 and Section AIV.2.7). 
 
AR5 assessed with high confidence that initialized predictions can improve the skill for temperature over the 
North Atlantic, in particular in the sub-polar branch of AMV, compared to the projections, for the first five 
years (see WGI AR5 Figures 11.3 and 11.4). However, non-initialized predictions showed positive 
correlation over the same time-range as well, consistent with the notion that part of this variability is caused 
by external forcing (see Chapter 3 Section 3.7.7). 
 
Since AR5, near-term initialized predictions, both multi-model (Bellucci et al., 2015a; García-Serrano et al., 
2015b; Smith et al., 2019b) and single-model ensembles (Marotzke et al., 2016)(Simpson et al., 
2018c)(Yeager et al., 2018)(Hermanson et al., 2020)(Bilbao et al., 2021), confirm substantial skill in 
hindcasting North-Atlantic SST anomalies on a time range of 8–10 years. On the same time range, (Borchert 
et al., 2021) show a substantial improvement in the prediction of the subpolar gyre SST (the northern 
component of the AMV) in CMIP6 models compared to CMIP5, in both initialized and non-initialized 
simulations. The higher skill can be attributed to a more accurate response in CMIP6 models to natural 
forcing, possibly originating from the AMOC-related delayed response to volcanic eruptions, which 
contribute to the SST variations in the subpolar gyre (Hermanson et al., 2020).  
 
Initialization contributes to the reduction of uncertainty and to predicting subpolar SST amplitude (Borchert 
et al., 2021). Yet, skill in predicting the AMV is not always translated into equally successful predictions of 
temperature and precipitation over the nearby land and ocean regions (Langehaug et al., 2017). This might 
be related to systematic model errors in the simulation of the spatial and temporal structure of the AMV and 
too weak associated teleconnections (see Section 3.7.7), and also to the larger noise in regional land 
variables compared to the AMV index. However, AMV predictions can be used as proxies to predict other 
variables such as precipitation over Western Europe and Eurasia  and SAT over Mediterranean, northern 
Europe and northeast Asia (Årthun et al., 2018; Borchert et al., 2019; Ruggieri et al., 2021) whose 
relationship with North Atlantic SST is robust in observations, but not well captured in climate models.  
 
Encouraging results about the prediction of land precipitation linked to the warm AMV phase (see Chapter 3 
Section 3.7.7 and Annex IV, Figure AIV.2.7) on a 2-9 year timescale are reported in the multi-model study 
by (Smith et al., 2019b). Positive correlations with observations are found in the Sahel, South America, the 
Maritime Continent. Analyses from large-ensemble decadal prediction systems such as the community Earth 
system model decadal prediction large ensemble (CESM-DPLE) (Yeager et al., 2018) show an improvement 
with respect to the CMIP5 decadal hindcasts (Martin and Thorncroft, 2014b) in forecasting Sahel 
precipitation over three to seven years, which is consistent with the current understanding of AMV impact 
over Africa (Mohino et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2019b). CESM-DPLE predicts drought conditions over the 
Sahel through 2020, which is compatible with a shift towards a negative phase of AMV as a result of a 
weakening of the AMOC, advocated by a number of studies (Hermanson et al., 2014; Robson et al., 2014; 
Yeager et al., 2015). 
 
In summary, the confidence in the predictions of AMV and its effects is medium. However, there is high 
confidence that the AMV skill over 5–8-year lead times is improved by using initialized predictions, 
compared to non-initialized simulations.   
 
 
## 4.4.4  Response to Short-Lived Climate Forcers and Volcanic Eruptions  
 
Mitigation of SLCFs affects future climate projections and could alter the time of emergence of 
anthropogenic climate change signals. AR5 assessed that emission reductions aimed at decreasing local air 
pollution could have a near-term warming impact on climate (high confidence) (Kirtman et al., 2013). 

Because of their shorter lifetimes, reductions in emissions of SLCF species mainly influence near-term 
GSAT trends (Chalmers et al., 2012; Shindell et al., 2017; Shindell and Smith, 2019), but on decadal 
timescales the near-term response to even very large reductions in SLCFs may be difficult to detect in the 
presence of large internal climate variability (Samset et al., 2020). The changes in SLCF emissions during 
the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a small net radiative forcing without a discernible impact on GSAT 
(Cross-Chapter Box 6.1). SLCF mitigation also leads to a higher GSAT in the mid- to long-term (Smith and 
Mizrahi, 2013; Stohl et al., 2015; Hienola et al., 2018) and can influence peak warming during the 21st 
century (Hienola et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2014). This section focuses on the total effect of SLCF changes 
on GSAT projections in the SSP scenarios. A more detailed breakdown of the separate climate effects of 
SLCF species and precursor species can be found in Sections 6.7.2 and 6.7.3. 
 
A model experiment based on the SSP3-7.0 scenario with aerosols, their precursors, and non-methane 
tropospheric ozone precursors set to SSP1-1.9 abundances (SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF-highCH4; Collins et al., 
2017) shows a projected multi-model mean GSAT anomaly that is higher by 0.22ºC at mid-century (2045-
2054) compared to SSP3-7.0 (Figure 4.18:; Allen et al., 2020), but this difference is smaller than the 
intermodel spread of the SSP3-7.0 projections based on the CMIP6 models. Note the SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF-
highCH4 experiment does not perturb methane from SSP3-7.0 concentrations. A modified SSP3-7.0-
lowSLCF-lowCH4 scenario that also includes methane mitigation shows a lower GSAT by mid-century 
compared to SSP3-7.0 (Allen et al., 2021).  
 
<figref>4.18</figref> 
 
Building on CMIP6 results for the effects of reducing SLCF emissions from a baseline of SSP3-7.0, the 
overall contribution of SLCFs to GSAT changes in the marker SSPs are now quantified using a simple 
climate model emulator. For consistency with Section 6.7.2 and Figure 6.22, the basket of SLCF compounds 
considered includes aerosols, ozone, methane, black carbon on snow and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) with 
lifetimes of less than 50 years. In the five marker SSPs considered, the net effect of SLCFs contributes to a 
higher GSAT in the near, mid- and long term (Table 4.6, Section 6.7.2). In the SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 
scenarios, SLCFs contribute to a higher GSAT by a central estimate of around 0.3 °C compared to 1995–
2014 across the three-time horizons. In the long-term, the 0.3 °C warming due to SLCFs in SSP1-2.6 can be 
compared to the assessed very likely GSAT change for this period of 0.5–1.5 °C (Section 4.3.4; Table 4.5). 
The SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios all show a larger SLCF effect on GSAT in the long term 
relative to the near term. In SSP3-7.0, the long-term warming due to SLCFs by 0.7 °C can be compared with 
the assessed very likely GSAT anomaly for this period of 2.0–3.7 °C (Section 4.3.4). In summary, it is very 
likely that changes in SLCFs contribute to an overall warmer GSAT over the near, mid- and long term in the 
five SSP scenarios considered (Table 4.6, Section 6.7.2; Figure 6.22).    
 
<tableref>4.6</tableref> 
 
In addition to effects on GSAT, SLCFs affect other aspects of the global climate system (Section 6.7.2). The 
additional warming at high northern latitudes associated with projected reductions in aerosol emissions over 
the 21st century leads to a more rapid reduction in Arctic sea-ice extent in the RCP scenarios (Gagné et al., 
2015). Furthermore, mitigation of non-methane SLCFs in the SSP3-7.0-lowSLCF-highCH4 scenario causes 
an increase in global mean precipitation, with larger regional changes in southern and eastern Asia (Allen et 
al., 2020). 
 
The main uncertainties in climate effects of SLCFs in the future come from: (i) the uncertainty in 
anthropogenic aerosol ERF (Section 7.3.3); (ii) uncertainty in the relative emissions of different SLCFs that 
have warming and cooling effects in the current climate (Section 6.2); and (iii) physical uncertainty 
including the efficacy of the climate response to SLCFs compared to long-lived GHGs (Marvel et al., 2016; 
Richardson et al., 2019). One example of physical uncertainty is that the shortwave radiative forcing from 
methane was neglected in previous calculations (Etminan et al., 2016; Collins et al., 2018), which affects 
understanding of present-day and future methane ERF (Modak et al., 2018b). Another example of physical 
uncertainty is projected changes in lightning-NOx production, which contributes to future ozone radiative 
forcing (Banerjee et al., 2014, 2018; Finney et al., 2018).  
 
Another factor that could substantially alter projections in the near-term would be the occurrence of a large 
explosive volcanic eruption, or even a decadal to multi-decadal sequence of small-to-moderate volcanic 
eruptions as witnessed over the early 21st century (Santer et al., 2014; Cross-Chapter Box 4.1). An eruption 
similar to the last large tropical eruption, Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in June 1991, is expected to 
cause substantial Northern Hemisphere (NH) cooling, peaking between 0.09°C and 0.38°C and lasting for 
three to five years, as indicated by climate model simulations over the past millennium (e.g., Jungclaus et al., 
2010). Phase 3 of Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP3) simulated a significant NH 
cooling in response to individual volcanic events (peaks between 0.1°C and 0.5°C, depending on model, 
during the first year after the eruption) that lasts for three to five years. On a regional scale, the double 
volcanic events that occurred in 536 and 540 CE resulted in a cooling of 2°C (Büntgen et al., 2016a; Toohey 
et al., 2016a).  
 
Since AR5, there has been growing progress in understanding the climate impacts of volcanic eruptions. 
Volcanic forcing is regarded as the dominant driver of forced variability in preindustrial surface air 
temperature (Schurer et al., 2013a, 2014). Large eruptions in the tropics and high latitudes were primary 
drivers of interannual-to-decadal temperature variability in the Northern Hemisphere during the past 2,500 
years, with cooling persisting for up to ten years after some of the largest eruptive episodes (Sigl et al., 
2015).  Repeated clusters of volcanic eruptions can induce a net negative radiative forcing that results in a 
centennial and global scale cooling trend via a decline in mixed-layer oceanic heat content (McGregor et al., 
2015). The response to multi-decadal changes in volcanic forcing (representing clusters of eruptions) shows 
similar cooling in both simulations and reconstructions of NH temperature. Volcanic eruptions generally 
result in decreased global precipitation for up to a few years following the eruption (Iles and Hegerl, 2014, 
2015; Man et al., 2014), with climatologically wet regions drying and climatologically dry regions wetting 
(medium confidence), which is opposite to the response under global warming (Held and Soden, 2006b; Iles 
et al., 2013; Zuo et al., 2019a, 2019b). El Niño-like warming appears after large volcanic eruptions that is 
seen in both observations (Adams et al., 2003; McGregor et al., 2010a; Khodri et al., 2017) and climate 
model simulations (Ohba et al., 2013; Pausata et al., 2015; Colose et al., 2016; Stevenson et al., 2016; Khodri 
et al., 2017; Predybaylo et al., 2017; Zuo et al., 2018). The large tropical eruptions are coincident with 
positive Indian Ocean Dipole events (Maher et al., 2015).  
 
In AR5, uncertainty due to future volcanic activity was not considered in the assessment of the CMIP5 21st 
century climate projections (Taylor et al., 2012; O’Neill et al., 2016). Since AR5, there has been 
considerable progress in quantifying the impacts of volcanic eruptions on decadal climate prediction and 
longer-term climate projections (Meehl et al., 2015; Swingedouw et al., 2015, 2017; Timmreck et al., 2016; 
Bethke et al., 2017; Illing et al., 2018). By exploring 60 possible volcanic futures under RCP4.5, it has been 
demonstrated that the inclusion of time-varying volcanic forcing may enhance climate variability on annual-
to-decadal timescales (Bethke et al., 2017). Consistent with a tropospheric cooling response, the change in 
ensemble spread in the volcanic cases is skewed towards lower GSAT relative to the non-volcanic cases 
(Cross-Chapter Box 4.1 Figure 1). In these simulations with multiple volcanic forcing futures there is: 1) an 
increase in the frequency of extremely cold individual years; 2) an increased likelihood of decades with 
negative GSAT trend (decades with negative GSAT trends become 50% more commonplace); 3) later 
anthropogenic signal emergence (the mean time at which the signal of global warming emerges from the 
noise of natural climate variability is delayed almost everywhere) (high confidence); and 4) a 10% overall 
reduction in global land monsoon precipitation and a 20% overall increase in the ensemble spread (Man et 
al., 2021).

# 4.5  Mid- to Long-term Global Climate Change  
 
## 4.5.1  Atmosphere  
 
This section assesses how the global atmospheric indicators assessed in Section 4.3 manifest themselves in 
large-scale spatial patterns of atmospheric change in the mid-term (2041–2060) and long term (2081–2100). 
The patterns of change in any given future period represent a combination of unforced internal variability 
and a forced response including their interaction (Deser et al., 2016). The role of internal variability is much 
larger at the local to regional scale than in the global mean projections. We here assess multi-model mean 
patterns based on CMIP6 models without any weighting or emergent constraints. The mean represents an 
estimate of the forced response and is a more homogeneous pattern than the 20-year mean change patterns in 
any individual model realization (Knutti et al., 2010).  
 
 
### 4.5.1.1  Near-Surface Air Temperature  
 
Patterns of near-surface air temperature changes show widespread warming by 2041–2060 and 2081–2100 
(Figure 4.19) for all SSPs relative to 1995–2014. The area fraction experiencing warming increases with the 
level of global mean warming. As GSAT continues to increase, it is very likely that by the middle and the 
end of the 21st century most of the global land and ocean areas will be warmer than in 1995–2014 (high 
confidence) (see also Section 4.3.1.1).  
 
<figref>4.19</figref>
 
The multi-model mean temperature change pattern (Figure 4.19) shows some robust key characteristics that 
are independent of the time horizon and scenario, such as a land-ocean warming contrast, amplified warming 
over the Arctic region, assessed below, or the comparatively small warming or even cooling in the North 
Atlantic subpolar gyre (see Section 9.2.1.1). Changes in aerosol concentrations and land use and land 
management can furthermore have a direct imprint on the regional warming pattern (Bright et al., 2017; 
Kasoar et al., 2018). Note that the global average of the pattern shown in Figure 4.19 corresponds to CMIP6 
multi-model mean GSAT warming (see Section 4.3.1) and is thus somewhat warmer than the warming 
pattern consistent with the central estimate of the GSAT range assessed in Section 4.3.4. Since the regional 
mean warming scales well with global warming levels independent of the emission scenario (see Section 
4.2.4), the key characteristics of the spatial pattern assessed here are largely independent of the difference 
between CMIP6 multi-model global mean and assessed global GSAT change. 
 
#### Land–Ocean Warming Contrast 
It is virtually certain that future average warming will be higher over land than over the ocean. SRCCL, 
Section 2.2.1 (Jia et al., 2019b) assessed that it is certain that land temperatures have increased more than 
global mean temperatures since the pre-industrial period. This so-called land-ocean warming contrast is a 
striking feature of observed trends (Lambert and Chiang, 2007; Byrne and O’Gorman, 2018) and projected 
changes in surface-air temperature (Sutton et al., 2007; Joshi and Gregory, 2008; Dong et al., 2009; Lambert 
et al., 2011; Drost et al., 2012; Bayr and Dommenget, 2013; Byrne and O’Gorman, 2013b; Izumi et al., 
2013; Joshi et al., 2013). Between 1979 and 2016, average temperature over land increased by 42% more 
than over the ocean (Byrne and O’Gorman, 2018). A similar warming contrast is found in CMIP5 
projections though with large differences across models and latitudes (Sutton et al., 2007; Drost et al., 2012; 
Byrne and O’Gorman, 2013b; Joshi et al., 2013), which is also consistent with paleoclimate evidence (Izumi 
et al., 2013; Schmidt et al., 2014). The ratio of land-to-ocean warming is greater than one for almost all 
regions (high confidence) and is larger for dry subtropical continents (about 1.5) than for moist regions in the 
tropics and mid-latitudes (about 1.2) (Byrne and O’Gorman, 2013a). 
 
Since AR5, a robust physical understanding of the warming contrast been developed. A simple theory based 
on atmospheric dynamics and moisture transport shows that surface-air temperature and relative humidity 
over land are strongly coupled, and demonstrates that the warming contrast occurs because air over land is 
drier than over the ocean (Joshi et al., 2008; Byrne and O’Gorman, 2013a, 2013b, 2018). The warming 
contrast causes land relative humidity to decrease (Byrne and O’Gorman, 2016, 2018; Chadwick et al., 2016) 
and this feeds back on and strengthens the warming contrast. Differences in land relative humidity responses 
across models are the primary cause of uncertainty in the land-ocean warming contrast (Byrne and 
O’Gorman, 2013b). These land relative humidity changes are ultimately controlled by moisture transport 
between the land and ocean boundary layers (Byrne and O’Gorman, 2016; Chadwick et al., 2016) and are 
also sensitive to characteristics of land surfaces that are challenging to model, including stomatal 
conductance and soil moisture (Berg et al., 2016; Zarakas et al., 2020). 
 
#### Polar Amplification 
It is very likely that under all SSPs the warming in the Arctic will be more pronounced than in the global 
average over the 21st century. Since AR5 the understanding of the physical mechanisms driving polar 
amplification has improved. 
 
The Arctic surface is projected to warm more than the global average over the 21st century, with annual-
average Arctic warming of about 3°C (SSP1-2.6), 10°C (SSP3-7.0) and 12°C in (SSP5-8.5) by 2081–2100 
relative to 1995–2014 (Figure 4.19). This phenomenon, known as polar or Arctic amplification, is a 
ubiquitous feature of the response to GHG forcing simulated by climate models (Manabe and Wetherald, 
1975; Manabe and Stouffer, 1980; Manabe and Wetherald, 1980; Robock, 1983; Hansen et al., 1984; 
Manabe et al., 1991; Holland and Bitz, 2003; Winton, 2006; Pithan and Mauritsen, 2014) and has been 
observed over recent decades concurrent with Arctic sea-ice loss (Serreze and Barry, 2011) (Chapter 2 
Section 2.3.2.1). Based on robust scientific understanding and agreement across multiple lines of evidence 
(Chapter 7 Section 7.4.4.1), there is high confidence that the rate of Arctic surface warming will continue to 
exceed the global average over the 21st century. 
 
A variety of mechanisms contribute to Arctic amplification (see Chapter 7 Section 7.4.4.1.1). While surface-
albedo feedbacks associated with the loss of sea ice and snow have long been known to play important roles 
(Arrhenius, 1896; Manabe and Stouffer, 1980; Robock, 1983; Hall, 2004), it is now recognized that 
temperature (lapse-rate and Planck) feedbacks also contribute to Arctic amplification through a less efficient 
longwave radiative damping to space with warming at high latitudes (Winton, 2006; Pithan and Mauritsen, 
2014; Goosse et al., 2018; Stuecker et al., 2018). Increases in poleward atmospheric latent heat transport and 
oceanic heat transport also contribute to Arctic warming (Holland and Bitz, 2003; Bitz et al., 2006; Lee et 
al., 2011, 2017; Alexeev and Jackson, 2013; Marshall et al., 2014, 2015; Woods and Caballero, 2016; Singh 
et al., 2017; Nummelin et al., 2017; Oldenburg et al., 2018; Merlis and Henry, 2018; Armour et al., 
2019)(Beer et al., 2020). Projected reduction in the strength of the AMOC over the 21st century is expected 
to reduce Arctic warming, but even a strong AMOC reduction would not eliminate Arctic amplification 
entirely (Liu et al., 2017, 2018d; Wen et al., 2018) (medium confidence).  
 
There remains substantial uncertainty in the magnitude of projected Arctic amplification (Smith et al., 2020), 
with the Arctic warming ranging from two to four times the global average in models (Holland and Bitz, 
2003; Nummelin et al., 2017). This uncertainty primarily stems from different representations of polar 
surface-albedo, lapse-rate, and cloud feedbacks, and from different projected poleward energy transport 
changes (Holland and Bitz, 2003; Crook et al., 2011; Mahlstein and Knutti, 2011; Pithan and Mauritsen, 
2014; Bonan et al., 2018). The magnitude of Arctic amplification may also depend on the mix of radiative 
forcing agents (Najafi et al., 2015; Sand et al., 2016; Stjern et al., 2019) such as the contribution of ozone 
depleting substances (Polvani et al., 2020). Tropospheric aerosol emissions tend to reduce simulated Arctic 
warming over the middle of the 20th century (Gagné et al., 2017a) and consequently aerosol emission 
reductions in observations and SSP scenarios enhance simulated Arctic warming over recent and future 
decades (Gagné et al., 2015; Acosta Navarro et al., 2016; Wobus et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018) (also see 
Chapter 6 Section 6.4.3). 
 
Climate models project weakly polar amplified warming in the SH under transient warming (Figure 4.19). 
Model simulations (Hall, 2004; Danabasoglu and Gent, 2009; Li et al., 2013) and paleoclimate proxies 
indicate polar amplification in both hemispheres near equilibrium, but generally with less warming in the 
Antarctic than the Arctic (Chapter 7, Section 7.4.4.1.2). The primary driver of delayed warming of the 
southern high latitudes is the upwelling in the Southern Ocean and associated ocean heat uptake that is then 
transported away from Antarctica by northward flowing surface waters (Froelicher et al., 2015; Marshall et 
al., 2015; Armour et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018c), although asymmetries in feedbacks between the poles also 
play a role (Chapter 7, Section 7.4.4.1.1). Changes in westerly surface winds over the Southern Ocean have 
the potential to affect the rate of sea-surface warming, but there is currently low confidence in even the sign 
of the effect based on a diverse range of climate model responses to wind changes (Marshall et al., 2014; 
Ferreira et al., 2015; Kostov et al., 2017; Seviour et al., 2019). A substantial increase in freshwater input to 
the ocean from the Antarctic ice sheet could further slow the emergence of SH polar amplification by 
cooling the Southern Ocean surface (Bronselaer et al., 2018; Golledge et al., 2019; Schloesser et al., 2019), 
but this process is not represented in current climate models which lack dynamic ice sheets. Thus, while 
there is high confidence that the SH high latitudes will warm by more than the tropics on centennial 
timescales, there is low confidence that such a feature will emerge this century (Chapter 7, Section 7.4.4.1). 
 
#### Seasonal Warming Patterns  
The warming pattern shows distinct seasonal characteristics. The majority of models show a stronger 
hemispheric winter than summer warming over land poleward of about 55°N and 55°S (Figure 4.20) and 
thereby a reduced amplitude of the temperature cycle (Dwyer et al., 2012; Donohoe and Battisti, 2013). On 
the other hand, over most of the subtropics and mid-latitudinal land regions except for parts of Asia, models 
project stronger warming in hemispheric summer than winter (Donohoe and Battisti, 2013; Santer et al., 
2018), leading to an amplification of the seasonal cycle. This phenomenon has been studied particularly in 
the case of the amplified summer warming over the Mediterranean region (Seager et al., 2014a; Kröner et al., 
2017; Brogli et al., 2019).  
 
<figref>4.20</figref> 
 
#### Changes in Temperature Variability 
It has long been recognized that along with mean temperatures also variance and skewness of the 
temperature distribution may be changing (Gregory and Mitchell, 1995; Mearns et al., 1997). By amplifying 
or dampening changes in the tail of temperature distribution such changes are potentially highly relevant to 
extremes (Chapter11, Section 11.3.1) and pose a serious challenge to adaptation measures. Changes in 
temperature variability can occur from diurnal to multi-decadal timescales and from the local to the global 
scale with potentially even opposing signals in different seasons and at the different spatial scales 
 
Changes in GSAT variability are poorly understood. Based on model experiments it has been suggested that 
unforced variability of GSAT tends to decrease in a warmer world as a result of reduced albedo variability in 
high latitudes resulting from melting snow and sea ice (Huntingford et al., 2013; Brown et al., 2017), but 
confidence remains low and an observed change has not been detected. An assessment of changes in global 
temperature variability is inherently challenging due to the interplay of unforced internal variability and 
forced changes.  
 
Changes in tropical temperature variability may arise from changes in the amplitude of ENSO (see Section 
4.5.3.2). Over the extratropics, several studies have identified robust large-scale patterns of changes in 
variability of annual and particularly seasonal mean temperature, including (a) a reduction in mid- to high-
latitude winter temperature variability and (b) an increase in summer temperature variability over land in the 
tropics and subtropics (Huntingford et al., 2013; Holmes et al., 2016)(Figure 4.21). The multi-ensemble 
average across seven single-model initial-condition large ensembles projects a consistent reduction in year-
to-year DJF variability around about 50-70°N and JJA variability around 55°–70°S along the edge of the sea 
ice- and snow-covered region (Figure 4.21). There is growing evidence that year-to-year and day-to-day 
temperature variability decreases in winter over northern mid- to high-latitudes (Fischer et al., 2011; De 
Vries et al., 2012; Screen, 2014; Schneider et al., 2015; Holmes et al., 2016; Borodina et al., 2017; Tamarin-
Brodsky et al., 2020) which implies that the lowest temperatures rise more than the respective climatological 
mean temperatures (medium confidence). Over the Northern Hemisphere, reduced high-latitude temperature 
variability is associated with disproportionally large warming in source region of cold-air advection due to 
Arctic amplification and land-sea contrast (De Vries et al., 2012; Screen, 2014; Holmes et al., 2016). It has 
further been argued that a reduction in snow and sea-ice coverage from partly to completely snow- and ice-
free ocean and land surface would substantially reduce cold-season temperature variability (Gregory and 
Mitchell, 1995; Fischer et al., 2011; Borodina et al., 2017) and lead to a shortening of the cold season and 
earlier onset of the warm season (Cassou and Cattiaux, 2016). Mid-latitudinal winter temperature variability 
is further affected by a complex interplay of a multitude of processes including potential changes in 
atmospheric circulation, but there is low confidence in the dominant contribution of Arctic warming 
compared to other drivers (see Cross-Chapter Box 10.1).   
 
<figref>4.21</figref> 
 
In JJA, the multi-model average projects an increase in year-to-year JJA variability over Central Europe and 
North America (Figure 4.21). In particular an increase in daily to interannual summer temperature variability 
has been projected over central Europe as a result of larger year-to-year variability in soil moisture 
conditions varying between a wet and dry regime and leading to enhanced land-atmosphere interaction 
(Seneviratne et al., 2006; Fischer et al., 2012; Holmes et al., 2016). Furthermore, the amplified warming in 
the source regions of warm-air advection due to land-ocean warming contrast and amplified Mediterranean 
warming (Seager et al., 2014a; Brogli et al., 2019), may lead to disproportionally strong warming of the 
hottest days and summers and thereby increased variability. Enhanced temperature variability is further 
projected over some land regions in the subtropics and tropics (Bathiany et al., 2018). 
 
In summary, there is medium confidence that continued warming will regionally lead to increased and 
decreased year-to-year temperature variability in the extratropics and there is medium confidence that year-
to-year temperature variability will decrease over parts of the mid- to high- latitudes of the winter 
hemisphere. 
 
 
### 4.5.1.2 Annual Mean Atmospheric Temperature
 
Section 12.4.3.2 of the AR5 assessed that there is high confidence in the overall pattern of projected end of 
21st century tropospheric temperature change and that it is very likely that some of the largest warming will 
occur in the northern high latitudes. They further assessed that proportionately larger warming is likely to 
occur in the tropical upper troposphere than at the tropical surface, but with medium confidence owing to the 
relatively large observational uncertainties and contradictory analyses regarding model accuracy in 
simulating tropical upper tropospheric temperature trends.  
 
<figref>4.22</figref> 
 
CMIP6 projections show warming throughout the troposphere by the end of this century and a mix of 
warming and cooling in the stratosphere depending on the emission scenario (Figure 4.22). The patterns of 
tropospheric temperature change are highly consistent with those derived from earlier generations of climate 
models as assessed in AR5, AR4 and TAR. In SSP1-2.6, the multi-model mean warming remains below 3°C 
everywhere in the troposphere except near the surface in the Arctic; this is similar to the findings in AR5 
based on CMIP5 models for RCP2.6. In SSP3-7.0, the zonal mean tropospheric warming is also largest in 
the tropical upper troposphere, reaching more than 5 °C, and near the surface in the Arctic where warming 
exceeds 8°C (Figure 4.22). It is likely that the warmer projected GSAT in the unconstrained CMIP6 model 
ensemble contributes to larger warming in the tropical upper troposphere and in the Arctic lower 
troposphere. This assessment is based on the understanding of polar amplification assessed in Chapter 7, 
Section 7.4.4.1, and at low latitudes is based on the understanding of moist convective processes as well as 
the relationship between CMIP5- and CMIP6-simulated surface temperatures and tropical upper tropospheric 
warming over the historical period (Section 3.3.1.2).  
 
Projected stratospheric temperature trends are determined by a balance between the major radiative drivers 
from ozone recovery, rising CO2 and other greenhouse gases (including stratospheric water vapour) 
(Maycock, 2016), as well as future changes in the Brewer Dobson circulation, which can alter the latitudinal 
pattern of stratospheric temperature trends (Fu et al., 2015, 2019). In the lower stratosphere, the CMIP6 
models project a weak cooling in the inner tropics in SSP1-2.6 and a warming at other latitudes (Figure 
4.22). There is enhanced lower stratospheric warming over the Antarctic pole owing to the effects of ozone 
hole recovery on polar temperatures (Maycock, 2016; Solomon et al., 2017). The projected strengthening of 
the Brewer Dobson circulation in the future (Hardiman et al., 2014) also affects stratospheric temperature 
trends, with adiabatic cooling at low latitudes and warming in middle and high latitudes (Fu et al., 2015, 
2019). In SSP3-7.0, there is widespread cooling across much of the stratosphere, as expected from the higher 
GHG emissions, with a smaller warming in the Antarctic lower stratosphere. Owing to the importance of 
ozone recovery for the radiative balance of the stratosphere, future global and local stratospheric temperature 
trends do not scale with projected GSAT change. 
 
In summary, new results since AR5 do not generally alter the understanding of projected zonal mean 
atmospheric temperature changes. There is high confidence in the overall pattern of projected tropospheric 
temperature changes given its robustness across many generations of climate models. It is further very likely 
that projected long-term tropospheric warming will be larger than the global mean in the Arctic lower 
troposphere. It is likely that tropical upper tropospheric warming will be larger than at the tropical surface, 
however with an uncertain magnitude owing to the potentially large role of natural internal variability and 
differences across models in the simulated free tropospheric temperature response to a given forcing scenario 
(Section 3.3.1.2). It is very likely that global mean stratospheric cooling will be larger by the end of the 21st 
century in a pathway with higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations. 
 
 
### 4.5.1.3  Near-Surface Relative Humidity  
 
AR5 contrasted future changes in near-surface relative humidity (RH) over land and ocean, concluding with 
medium confidence that reductions in near-surface RH over many land areas are likely. The decrease in near-
surface RH over most land areas is associated with the larger warming rates over land than over the ocean 
and is termed the last-saturation-temperature constraint, as explained in AR5. 
 
Since AR5, significant effort has been devoted to understanding the mechanisms for the decrease in near-
surface land RH under global warming, and the relevance of RH changes for the land–sea warming contrast 
and the water cycle. For the near-surface RH decrease over land, both the moisture transport from the ocean 
and land-atmosphere feedback processes contribute. For changes in specific humidity over land, the moisture 
transport from the ocean is dominant while the role of evapotranspiration is secondary (Byrne and 
O’Gorman, 2016; Chadwick et al., 2016). Nevertheless, the changes in near-surface land RH are also 
strongly influenced by evapotranspiration, which is suppressed by the drying of soils and plant responses to 
increasing CO2 related to stomatal closure under climate change (Byrne and O’Gorman, 2015; Berg et al., 
2016; Chadwick et al., 2016; Swann et al., 2016; Lemordant et al., 2018). The combination of oceanic and 
continental influences can explain the spatially diverse trends in the near-surface RH over land in the 
observations for the recent decades, with a generally dominant negative trend at the global scale (Vicente-
Serrano et al., 2018). There is a strong feedback between the near-surface land RH decrease and land-ocean 
warming contrast under future warming projections (see Section 4.5.1.1).  
 
Changes in land RH can modulate the response of the water cycle to global warming (Chadwick et al., 2013; 
Byrne and O’Gorman, 2015). Most CMIP5 models project higher precipitation associated with higher near-
surface RH and temperature under climate change (Lambert et al., 2017). Over land, the spatial gradients of 
fractional changes in near-surface RH contribute to a drying tendency in precipitation minus 
evapotranspiration with warming, which partly explains why the ‘wet-gets-wetter, dry-gets-drier’ principle 
does not hold over land (Byrne and O’Gorman, 2015). Terrestrial aridity is projected to increase over land, 
as manifested by a decrease in the ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration, in which the decrease 
in near-surface land RH has a contribution of about 35% in CMIP5 models under doubled CO2 forcing (Fu 
and Feng, 2014). The aridity can be further amplified by the feedbacks of projected drier soils on land 
surface temperature, RH, and precipitation (Berg et al., 2016). 
 
The CMIP6 multi-model ensemble projects general decreases in near-surface relative humidity over a large 
fraction of land areas, but moderate increases over the ocean (Figure 4.23). The projected changes depend on 
emission scenario and season. Changes in near-surface RH under SSP1-2.6 are insignificant compared to 
natural variability. Under SSP3-7.0, during boreal summer, significant decreases relative to natural 
variability are projected in continental Europe and the Middle East, North America, South America and 
South Africa. 
 
In summary, there is medium confidence that continued warming will lead to decreased near-surface relative 
humidity over a large fraction of land areas, but moderate increases over the ocean. There is high confidence 
that near-surface relative humidity will decrease over parts of the tropical and subtropical latitudes over land. 
 
<figref>4.23</figref> 
 
### 4.5.1.4  Precipitation  
 
AR5 assessed that changes in mean precipitation in a warmer world will exhibit substantial spatial variation 
and the contrast of mean precipitation between dry and wet regions and between dry and wet seasons will 
increase over most of globe as temperature increase. The general pattern of change indicates that high 
latitude land masses are likely to experience greater amounts of precipitation due to the increased specific 
humidity of the warmer troposphere as well as increased transport of water vapour from the tropics by the 
end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario. Many mid-latitude and subtropical arid and semi-arid regions 
will likely experience less precipitation and many moist mid-latitude regions will likely experience more 
precipitation by the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario.  
 
Since AR5, progress has been achieved in understanding changes in patterns and rates of precipitation with 
GSAT rise. The projected precipitation changes can be decomposed into a part that is related to atmospheric 
circulation referred to as dynamical component and a part related to water vapour changes, the 
thermodynamic component. Based on process understanding and modelling (Fläschner et al., 2016; Samset 
et al., 2016), global mean precipitation will very likely increase by 1–3% per °C of GSAT warming (see 
Section 8.2.1). The increase in atmospheric water vapour is a robust change under global warming, the 
sensitivity of global precipitation change to warming is smaller (2% °C-1) as compared to water vapour 
change (7% °C-1) (Held and Soden, 2006a). Global energy balance places a strong constraint on the global 
mean precipitation (Allen and Ingram, 2002; Pendergrass and Hartmann, 2014; Myhre et al., 2018; Siler et 
al., 2019). Tropospheric radiative cooling constrains global precipitation (Pendergrass and Hartmann, 2014), 
leading to a slow SST-dependent response and a forcing-dependent rapid adjustment. Rapid adjustments 
account for large regional differences in hydrological sensitivity across multiple drivers (Samset et al., 2016; 
Myhre et al., 2017). The rapid regional precipitation response to increased CO2 is robust across models, 
implying that the uncertainty in long-term changes is mainly associated with the response to SST-mediated 
feedbacks (Richardson et al., 2016). Precipitation response to fast adjustments and slow temperature-driven 
responses are assessed in detail in Chapter 8 Section 8.2.1. 
 
The thermodynamic response to global warming is associated with a wet-get-wetter mechanism, with 
enhanced moisture flux leading to subtropical dry regions getting drier and tropical and mid-latitude wet 
regions getting wetter (Held and Soden, 2006a; Chou et al., 2009). Recent studies suggest that the dry-get-
drier argument does not hold, especially over subtropical land regions (Greve et al., 2014; Feng and Zhang, 
2015; Greve and Seneviratne, 2015). The discrepancy may be partly arising due to differences in model 
climatologies and by change in the location of  wet and dry regions (Polson and Hegerl, 2017). Over the 21st 
century, significant rate of precipitation change is associated with a spatial stabilization and intensification of 
moistening and drying patterns (Chavaillaz et al., 2016a). In the tropics, weakening of circulation leads to a 
wet-gets-drier and dry-gets-wetter pattern (Chadwick et al., 2013). Climate model agreement for 
precipitation change in the tropics is lower than for other regions (Knutti and Sedláček, 2013; McSweeney 
and Jones, 2013). Sources of inter-model uncertainty in regional rainfall projections arise from circulation 
changes (Kent et al., 2015; Chadwick, 2016) and spatial shifts in convection and convergence, associated 
with SST pattern change and land–sea thermal contrast change (Kent et al., 2015; Chadwick et al., 2017) 
with a secondary contribution from the response to direct CO2 forcing (Chadwick, 2016). Factors governing 
changes in large-scale precipitation patterns are assessed in detail in Section 8.2.2 and Section 10.4.1. 
 
Long-term multi-model mean change in seasonal precipitation (JJA and DJF) from CMIP6 models (Figure 
4.24) shows substantial regional differences and seasonal contrast. Changes in seasonal precipitation under 
SSP1-2.6 are small compared to internal variability. Consistent with the AR5, patterns of precipitation 
change show very likely increase in the high latitudes especially during local winter and over tropical 
oceanoceans under SSP3-7.0 (high confidence). CMIP6 projections show an increase in precipitation over 
larger parts of the monsoon regions and decreases in many subtropical regions including the Mediterranean, 
southern Africa and southwest Australia (medium confidence). The large-scale patterns of precipitation 
shown in Figure 4.24 are consistent with the patterns presented in Section 8.4.1.3. Precipitation changes 
exhibit strong seasonal characteristics (Box 8.2), and, in many regions, the sign of the precipitation changes 
varies with season. Precipitation variability is projected to increase over a majority of global land area, as 
assessed in Chapter 8 Section 8.4.1.3.3, over a wide range of timescales in response to warming (Pendergrass 
et al., 2017).    
 
<figref>4.24</figref> 
 
Most of the projected changes in precipitation exhibit a sharp contrast between land and ocean (see Sections 
8.2.1 and 8.4.1). Temperature-driven intensification of land-mean precipitation during the 20th century has 
been masked by fast precipitation responses to anthropogenic sulphate and volcanic forcing (Allen and 
Ingram, 2002; Richardson et al., 2018b). Based on the Precipitation Driver and Response Model 
Intercomparison Project (PDRMIP),  land-mean precipitation is expected to increase more rapidly with the 
projected decrease in sulphate forcing and continued warming, contributing to increase global mean 
precipitation (Table 4.3) and will be clearly observable by the mid-21st century based on RCP4.5 and 
RCP8.5 scenarios (Richardson et al., 2018b).  
 
Consistent with the findings of AR5, a gradual increase in global mean precipitation is projected over the 
21st century with an increase of approximately 2.9% (1.0–5.2%) under SSP1-2.6 and 4.7% (2.3–8.2%) under 
SSP3-7.0 during 2081–2100 relative to 1995–2014. The corresponding increase in annual mean global land 
precipitation is 3.3% (0–6.6%), in the SSP1-2.6 and 5.8% (0.5–9.6%) in the SSP3-7.0. (See also Table 4.3). 
CMIP6 models show greater increases in precipitation over land than either globally or over the ocean (high 
confidence). 
 
Based on the assessment of CMIP6 models, we conclude that it is very likely that, in the long term, global 
mean land and global mean ocean precipitation will increase with increasing GSAT. Annual mean and global 
mean precipitation will very likely increase by 1–3% per °C GSAT warming. The patterns of precipitation 
change will exhibit substantial regional differences and seasonal contrast as GSAT increases over the 21st 
century (high confidence). Precipitation will very likely increase over high latitudes and the tropical ocean 
and likely increase in large parts of the monsoon regions, but likely decrease over the subtropics, including 
Mediterranean, southern Africa and southwest Australia, in response to GHG-induced warming. 
  
 
### 4.5.1.5  Global Monsoon Precipitation and Circulation  
 
AR5 assessed changes of the global monsoon in the context of long-term trends across the 21st century and 
the change by 2081–2100. AR5 showed growing evidence of improved skill of climate models in 
reproducing the climatological features of the global monsoon. Taken together with identified model 
agreement on future changes, the global monsoon precipitation, aggregated over all regional monsoon 
regions, is likely to strengthen in the 21st century with increases in its area and intensity, while the monsoon 
circulation weakens. In all RCP scenarios, the global monsoon area is very likely to increase, and the global 
monsoon precipitation intensity is likely to increase, resulting in a very likely increase in the global monsoon 
total precipitation, by 2081–2100 (Kitoh et al., 2013). 
 
Since AR5, there has been progress in understanding physical mechanisms for the projected changes in 
global monsoon and quantifying the sources of uncertainty in projections. The increase in global monsoon 
precipitation under warming is primarily attributed to the increase of moisture convergence, which comes 
mainly from the thermodynamic effect due to increasing atmospheric moisture but is partly offset by reduced 
convergence (Zhang et al., 2019b; Chen et al., 2020). The dynamic effect, such as monsoon circulation 
changes, dominates regional differences in the projected monsoon precipitation changes (Chen et al., 2020). 
Specifically, NH monsoon precipitation will increase more strongly than its SH counterpart, due to an 
increase in hemispheric temperature difference between the NH and SH, enhancement of the Hadley 
circulation, and atmospheric moistening, countered by stabilization of the troposphere (Lee and Wang, 
2014). The seasonality of global monsoon rainfall is projected to enhance in response to warming, featuring 
a greater wet-dry season contrast (Lee and Wang 2014; Zhang et al. 2019). In addition, the interannual 
variability of global monsoon rainfall is projected to intensify mainly over land, with a strengthened 
relationship between global monsoon and ENSO (Hsu et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2020, 2021). 
 
For the uncertainty in mean monsoon precipitation projections, the model uncertainty is the dominant 
contributor throughout the century and explains more than 70% of the inter-model variance during near term, 
mid-term, and long term. The contribution of internal variability is only important at the beginning in early 
decades, while scenario uncertainty becomes important at the end of the 21st century. The sources of 
uncertainty for the mean and extreme monsoon precipitation mainly differ in the long-term projection, when 
the contribution of scenario uncertainty is comparable to the model uncertainty for extreme precipitation 
(Zhou et al., 2020). Although the magnitude of internal variability differs between CMIP5 models and 
single-model initial-condition large ensembles, the impact is only evident in the beginning decades. For the 
mid- and long term, the magnitude difference does not alter that model uncertainty is the dominant source of 
uncertainty in the projections of global land monsoon precipitation (Zhou et al., 2020). 
 
Based on the projections of changes in precipitation from CMIP6 under the four SSPs, the global monsoon 
precipitation is likely to strengthen in the 21st century with increases in its intensity, while NH summer 
monsoon circulation weakens (Figure 4.14). Global land monsoon precipitation will likely increase by 1.3–
2.4 % per °C GSAT warming among the four scenarios considered here. In the long term, the multi-model 
mean change (5–95% range of the available 41 projections) of global land monsoon precipitation index is 
2.9% (–0.8–7.8%), 3.7% (–2.5–8.6%), 3.77% (–3.2–8.1%), and 5.7% (–2.8–12.3%) under SSP1–2.6, SSP2–
4.5, SSP3–7.0, and SSP5–8.5, respectively. This enhancement is caused by thermodynamic responses due to 
increased moisture, which is partly offset by dynamic responses due to a weakened circulation (Chen et al., 
2020). The patterns of monsoon rainfall changes in the mid- to long-term include a North–South asymmetry 
characterized by greater increase in the NH than the SH, and an East–West asymmetry characterized by 
enhanced Asian-African monsoons and weakened North American monsoon (medium confidence) (Lee and 
Wang, 2014; Mohtadi et al., 2016; Pascale et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2021).  
 
Based on the assessment of CMIP6 models, we conclude that it is likely that, in the mid- to long term, the 
global land monsoon precipitation will increase with GSAT rise despite a weakened monsoon circulation. 
The global land monsoon precipitation will likely increase by 1.3–2.4 % per °C GSAT warming among the 
four scenarios. Monsoon precipitation responses depend on region and emission scenario (high confidence). 
 
 
### 4.5.1.6 Sea Level Pressure, Large-scale Atmospheric Circulation, Storm Tracks and Blocking
 
This subsection provides a global overview of long-term changes in atmospheric dynamical features that is 
complementary to the regional assessment of links to the hydrological cycle in Chapter 8, Section 8.4.2, and 
assessment of the connections to extreme events in Chapter 11, Section 11.7.2. 
 
#### Sea level pressure 

AR5 assessed that mean sea level pressure is projected to decrease in high latitudes and to increase in mid-
latitudes. Such a pattern is associated with a poleward shift in the storm track and an increase in the annular 
mode index. This broad pattern is also found in CMIP6 models (Figure 4.25). Under SSP1-2.6, the pattern in 
sea level pressure change resembles that for SSP3-7.0, but the amplitudes are small compared to internal 
variability in 20-year means (Figure 4.25). One exception is found in the SH mid-latitudes, where pressure 
robustly increases in SSP3-7.0 in both austral summer and winter, but shows no robust change in SSP1-2.6. 
This is likely attributable to the larger GHG forcing in SSP3-7.0 compared to SSP1-2.6, which contributes to 
a poleward shift of the SH mid-latitude circulation and becomes relatively more important than the effect of 
ozone recovery which drives an equatorward shift in the circulation (Barnes and Polvani, 2013; Barnes et al., 
2014; Bracegirdle et al., 2020b) (see Section 4.5.3.1 on the Southern Annular Mode). The poleward shift in 
SH mid-latitude circulation in SSP3-7.0 likely contributes to the wetting trend at high southern latitudes 
(Figure 4.25).  
 
As was found in AR5, several regional sea level pressure features stand out from the zonal-mean change. Sea 
level pressure markedly decreases in northeastern North America and northeastern Asia in boreal winter. In 
boreal summer, sea level pressure robustly decreases in the Mediterranean and the Middle-East, a decrease 
that has been linked to a large-scale heat low forced by the amplified warming of the region (Haarsma et al., 
2009). It is likely that sea level pressure will increase across the southwestern North America and Central 
America in boreal summer under SSP3-7.0 due to an intensification of the eastern North Pacific subtropical 
summer high (Li et al., 2012) and a weakening of the North American monsoon (Wang et al., 2020)(Pascale 
et al., 2017)(see Section 4.5.1.5). These changes in circulation are connected to drying across the eastern 
subtropical Pacific and Central America regions (Figure 4.24:).  
 
<figref>4.25</figref> 
 
#### Zonal wind and westerly jets 
 
Storm tracks and mid-latitude westerly jets are dynamically related aspects of mid-latitude circulation. AR5 
assessed that a poleward shift of the SH westerlies and storm track is likely by the end of the 21st century 
under RCP8.5 (medium confidence). In contrast, low confidence was assessed for the storm-track response in 
the NH. 
 
Under both SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0 there is a strengthening and lifting of the subtropical jets in both 
hemispheres (Figure 4.26), consistent with the response to large-scale tropospheric warming found in earlier 
generations of climate models (Collins et al., 2013). In the SH, GHG emissions tend to force a poleward shift 
of the jet, but this is opposed, particularly in austral summer, by the stratospheric ozone hole recovery 
(Barnes and Polvani, 2013; Barnes et al., 2014; Bracegirdle et al., 2020b). Consistent with sea level pressure 
changes, CMIP6 models project a strengthening and poleward shift of the SH jet in austral summer and 
winter under SSP3-7.0, but smaller and non-robust changes in SH mid-latitude zonal winds under SSP1-2.6 
(Figure 4.26, see also Section 4.5.3.1). CMIP6 models show an improved simulation of the SH jet stream 
latitude (Bracegirdle et al., 2020a; Curtis et al., 2020). This has been linked to a reduction in the projected 
poleward shift of the SH jet in austral summer compared to the CMIP5 models (Curtis et al., 2020; Goyal et 
al., 2021), although differences in the pattern of SST response may also play a role (Wood et al., 2020). In 
the NH extratropics, the changes in lower tropospheric zonal mean zonal winds by the end of the century are 
generally smaller than in the SH. In boreal winter, there is a weak poleward shift of the NH zonal mean 
westerly jet maximum in SSP3-7.0.  
 
CMIP5 and CMIP6 models show a strong seasonal and regional dependence in the response to climate 
change of NH westerlies (Barnes and Polvani, 2013; Grise and Polvani, 2014b; Simpson et al., 2014; Zappa 
et al., 2015; Harvey et al., 2020; Oudar et al., 2020). CMIP5 projections indicate a poleward shift of the 
westerlies in the North Atlantic in boreal summer, while the North Pacific jet weakens in this season 
(Simpson et al., 2014; Davini and D’Andrea, 2020; Harvey et al., 2020). There is a poleward shift in the 
westerlies in both the North Pacific and North Atlantic in Autumn (Barnes and Polvani, 2013; Simpson et al., 
2014). However, the shift of the westerlies is more uncertain in the other seasons particularly in the North 
Atlantic in winter (Simpson et al., 2014; Zappa and Shepherd, 2017). Here, the circulation response is not 
well described as a simple shift, since the North Atlantic jet tends to be squeezed on both its equatorward and 
poleward flanks, together with an eastward extension into Europe (Li et al., 2018; Peings et al., 2018; 
Simpson et al., 2019b; Harvey et al., 2020; Oudar et al., 2020). Simulations indicate that most of the changes 
in winter storminess over the Euro-Atlantic region will occur only after exceeding the 1.5°C warming level 
(Barcikowska et al., 2018).  
 
<figref>4.26</figref> 
 
Progress since AR5 has improved understanding of the climate change aspects that can drive these different, 
and potentially opposite, responses in the mid-latitude jets and storm tracks. A poleward shift of the jets and 
storm tracks is expected in response to an increase in the atmospheric stratification and in the upper-
tropospheric equator-to-pole meridional temperature gradient, while it is opposed by the decrease in the 
meridional temperature gradient in the lower troposphere associated with the polar amplification of global 
warming (Harvey et al., 2014; Shaw et al., 2016b). Recent analyses have identified additional climate aspects 
that can drive mid-latitude jet changes, including patterns in sea surface warming (Mizuta et al., 2014; 
Langenbrunner et al., 2015; Ceppi et al., 2018; Wood et al., 2020), land-sea warming contrast (Shaw and 
Voigt, 2015),  loss of sea ice (Zappa et al., 2018)(Deser et al., 2015)(Harvey et al., 2015)(Screen et al., 
2018b), and changes in the strength of the stratospheric polar vortex (Simpson et al., 2018b)(Manzini et al., 
2014)(Grise and Polvani, 2017)(Ceppi and Shepherd, 2019a). From an energetics perspective, the 
uncertainty in the response of the jet streams depends on the response of clouds, their non-spatially uniform 
radiative feedbacks shaping the meridional profile of warming (Ceppi et al., 2014; Voigt and Shaw, 2015, 
2016; Ceppi and Hartmann, 2016; Ceppi and Shepherd, 2017; Lipat et al., 2018; Albern et al., 2019; Voigt et 
al., 2019). Climate models seem to underestimate the forced component of the year-to-year variability in the 
atmospheric circulation, particularly in the North Atlantic sector (Scaife and Smith, 2018), which suggests 
some relevant dynamical processes may not be well represented. Whether and how this may affect long-term 
projections is unknown. In conclusion, due to the influence from competing dynamical drivers and the 
absence of observational evidence, there is medium confidence in a projected poleward shift of the NH 
zonal-mean low-level westerlies in autumn and summer and low confidence in the other seasons. There is 
also overall low confidence in projected regional changes in the NH low-level westerlies, particularly for the 
North Atlantic basin in boreal winter. 
 
The anthropogenic forced signal in extratropical atmospheric circulation may well be small compared to 
internal variability (Deser et al., 2012b, 2014) and, as assessed in AR5, there is generally low agreement 
across models in many aspects of regional atmospheric circulation change particularly in the NH (Shepherd, 
2014). The latter means that, in some regions, a multi-model average perspective of atmospheric circulation 
change represents a small residual after averaging over large intermodel spread. This is in strong contrast to 
thermodynamic aspects of climate change, such as surface temperature change, for which model results are 
generally highly consistent (see, e.g., Figure 4.19). Furthermore, models share systematic biases in some 
aspects of extratropical atmospheric circulation such as mid-latitude jets, which can have complex 
implications for understanding forced changes (Simpson and Polvani, 2016a). Given these issues, an 
emerging field of research since AR5 has focused on the development of ‘storylines’ for regional 
atmospheric circulation change (Shepherd, 2019). The storyline approach is grounded in the identification of 
a set of physical predictors of atmospheric circulation change, such as those described above (Harvey et al., 
2014; Manzini et al., 2014; Shepherd et al., 2018), which act together to determine a specific outcome in 
theprojected atmospheric circulation change. The consequences of multi-model spread in the physical 
predictors of atmospheric circulation change can be investigated, conditioned on a specified level of global 
warming (Zappa and Shepherd, 2017; Zappa, 2019; Mindlin et al., 2020) (also see Chapter 1, Section 
1.4.4.2).  
 
#### Storm tracks 
As stated in AR5, the number of extratropical cyclones (ETC) composing the storm tracks is projected to 
weakly decline in future projections, but by no more than a few percent change. The reduction is mostly 
located on the equatorward flank of the storm tracks, which is associated with the Hadley cell expansion and 
a poleward shift in the mean genesis latitude of ETCs (Tamarin-Brodsky and Kaspi, 2017). Furthermore, the 
poleward propagation of individual ETCs is expected to increase with warming (Graff and LaCasce, 2014; 
Tamarin-Brodsky and Kaspi, 2017), thus contributing to a poleward shift in the mid-latitude transient-eddy 
kinetic energy. The increased poleward propagation results from the strengthening of the upper tropospheric 
jet and increased cyclone-associated precipitation (Tamarin-Brodsky and Kaspi, 2017), which are robust 
aspects of climate change.  
 
In the NH boreal winter, CMIP6 models show a northward shift of the ETC density in the North Pacific, a 
tripolar pattern in the North Atlantic, and a weakening of the Mediterranean storm track (Figure 4.27a). 
CMIP6 models show overall low agreement on changes in ETC density in the North Atlantic in boreal 
winter (Figure 4.27a). A poleward shift of the storm track is evident in the SH (Figure 4.27b), particularly in 
the Indian and Pacific Ocean sectors. CMIP6 models still feature long-standing biases in the representation 
of storm tracks, such as a too zonal winter storm track into Europe, though different measures of storm track 
activity indicate some improvements compared to the previous generations of models (Harvey et al., 2020; 
Priestley et al., 2020) 
 
Regarding the dynamical intensity of the storm tracks (see also Chapter 11, Section 11.7.2), the number of 
ETCs associated with intense surface wind speeds and undergoing explosive pressure deepening are 
projected to strongly decrease in the NH winter (Seiler and Zwiers, 2016; Chang, 2018). The weakening of 
surface winds of ETCs in the NH is attributed to the reduced low-level baroclinicity from SST and sea ice 
changes (Harvey et al., 2014; Seiler and Zwiers, 2016; Wang et al., 2017a).  There are, however, regional 
exceptions such as in the northern North Pacific, where explosive and intense ETCs are projected to increase 
in association with the poleward shift of the jet and increased upper-level baroclinicity (Seiler and Zwiers, 
2016). Eddy kinetic energy and intense cyclone activity is also projected to decrease in the NH summer in 
association with a weakening of the jet (Lehmann et al., 2014; Chang et al., 2016). However, climate models 
tend to have too weak explosive cyclones (Seiler and Zwiers, 2016; Priestley et al., 2020), though this bias 
seems to be reduced in high-resolution simulations (Jiaxiang et al., 2020). Furthermore, models may not 
fully capture the contribution of the future increase in mesoscale latent heating to cyclone intensification (Li 
et al., 2014; Pfahl et al., 2015; Willison et al., 2015; Michaelis et al., 2017). In conclusion, there is only 
medium confidence in the projected decrease in the frequency of intense NH ETCs. 

In contrast to the NH, the SH shows an increase in the frequency of intense ETCs in CMIP5 models (Chang, 
2017), and there is high confidence that wind speeds associated with ETCs are expected to intensify in the 
SH storm track for high emission scenarios. These changes in intensity are accompanied by an overall 
southward shift of the SH winter storm track (Figure 4.27b) due to the poleward shift in the upper-level jet 
and the increase in the meridional SST gradient linked to the slower warming of the Southern Ocean 
(Grieger et al., 2014) .  
 
Regardless of dynamical intensity changes, there is high confidence that the number of ETCs associated with 
extreme precipitation is projected to increase with warming, due to the increase moisture-loading capacity of 
the atmosphere (Yettella and Kay, 2017; Hawcroft et al., 2018) (see also Chapter 8, Section 8.4.2).  
 
<figref>4.27</figref> 
 
#### Atmospheric blocking 
Blocking is associated with a class of quasi-stationary high-pressure weather systems in the middle and high 
latitudes that disrupt the prevailing westerly flow. These events can persist for extended periods, such as a 
week or longer, and can cause long-lived extreme weather conditions, from heat waves in summer to cold 
spells in winter (see Chapter 11, Section 11.7.2 for a detailed discussion of these features and Chapter 3, 
Section 3.3.3.3 for the assessment of blocking biases in models simulations). AR5 assessed with medium 
confidence that the frequency of blocking would not increase under enhanced GHG concentrations, while 
changes in blocking intensity and persistence remained uncertain. 
 
CMIP5 projections suggest that the response of blocking frequency to climate change might be quite 
complex (Dunn-Sigouin et al., 2013; Masato et al., 2013). An eastward shift of winter blocking activity in 
the NH is indicated (Masato et al., 2013; Kitano and Yamada, 2016; Lee and Ahn, 2017; Matsueda and 
Endo, 2017) while during boreal summer, blocking frequency tends to decrease in mid-latitudes (Matsueda 
and Endo, 2017), with the exception of the eastern Europe–western Russia region (Masato et al., 2013). The 
projected decrease of blocking in boreal summer partially contrasts with the observed increase in Greenland 
blocking (Hanna et al., 2018; Davini and D’Andrea, 2020). However, as shown in Woollings et al. (2018), 
the spatial distribution and the magnitude of the suggested changes are sensitive to the blocking detection 
methods (Schwierz et al., 2004; Barriopedro et al., 2010; Davini et al., 2012). In the SH, blocking frequency 
is projected to decrease in the Pacific sector during austral spring and summer. However, seasonal and 
regional changes are not totally consistent across the models (Parsons et al., 2016), and, as assessed in 
Section 3.3.3.3, model biases might affect their response.  
 
To better understand the uncertainty in future blocking activity, a process-oriented approach has been 
proposed that aims to link blocking responses to different features of the global warming pattern. Upper-
level tropical warming might be the key factor leading to a reduced blocking, because of the strengthening of 
zonal winds (Kennedy et al., 2016). The more controversial influence of near-surface Arctic warming might 
lead to an increased blocking frequency (Mori et al., 2014; Francis and Vavrus, 2015) (see Chapter 10, Box 
10.1).  
 
Figure 4.28 shows a clear decrease in blocking activity over Greenland and North Pacific for SSP7.0 and 
SSP8.5. Models with the largest decrease in blocking frequency in boreal winter are those showing the 
smallest frequency bias during the historical period (Davini and D’Andrea, 2020). In conclusion, there is 
medium confidence that the frequency of atmospheric blocking events over Greenland and the North Pacific 
will decrease in boreal winter in the SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. 
 
<figref>4.28</figref> 
 
## 4.5.2  Ocean  
 
### 4.5.2.1  Ocean Temperature 
 
Projections of long-term ocean thermal properties are assessed comprehensively in Chapter 9, Sections 
9.2.1.1 and 9.2.2.1 and are not covered here to avoid unnecessary overlap.   
 
### 4.5.2.2  Ocean acidification 
 
The model-simulated long-term trend of ocean acidification is assessed in Section 4.3.2.5 and Chapter 5, 
Section 5.3.4.1. It is virtually certain that surface ocean acidification will continue in response to the rise in 
atmospheric CO2, and  continued penetration of anthropogenic CO2 from the surface to the deep ocean will 
acidify the ocean interior (Figure 4.29). By the end of this century, under SSP3-7.0, a pH reduction of about 
0.3 is found at a few hundred meters depth of the global ocean, with stronger acidification in the interior 
North Atlantic and the mid-to-high-latitude Southern Ocean. At a depth of about 1 km, a pH reduction of 
about 0.1 is found.  
    
Projections with CMIP6 ESMs (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020) show a surface pH decline of –0.16 ± 0.002 (±1 
standard deviation) under SSP1-2.6 and –0.44 ± 0.005 under SSP5-8.5 from 1870–1899 to 2080–2099. The 
high-latitude oceans, in particular the Arctic, show greater decline in pH and accelerated acidification 
(Terhaar et al., 2020). For the same period, model-projected bottom-water pH decline is –0.018 ± 0.001 
under SSP1-2.6 and –0.030 ± 0.002 under SSP5-8.5. The projected large scale surface ocean acidification 
will be primarily determined by the pathway of atmospheric CO2, with weak dependence on change in 
climate (Hurd et al., 2018) (see also Section 5.3.4.1) (high confidence). However, for a given atmospheric 
CO2 scenario, uncertainty in projected ocean acidification increases with ocean depth because of model-
simulated differences in ocean circulation that transports anthropogenic CO2 from the surface to bottom 
ocean (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020) (high confidence). For example, projected surface pH fully separates 
between SSPs scenarios before 2050, but some overlap across SSPs is still found for projected bottom-water 
pH in 2080 (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). 
 
<figref>4.29</figref> 
 
## 4.5.3  Modes of Variability  
 
### 4.5.3.1 Northern and Southern Annular Modes
 
#### The Northern Annular Mode  
AR5 assessed from CMIP5 simulations that the future boreal wintertime NAM is very likely to exhibit 
natural variability and forced trends of similar magnitude to that observed in the historical period and is 
likely to become slightly more positive in the future. Considerable uncertainty is related to physical 
mechanisms to explain the observed and projected changes in the NAM, but NAM trends are clearly closely 
connected to projected shifts in the mid-latitude jets and storm tracks.  
 
NAM projections from climate models analysed since AR5 reveal broadly similar results the late 21st 
century. CMIP6 models show a positive ensemble-mean trend in most seasons and the higher emission 
scenarios that is comparable to between-model or between-realization variability (Figure 4.30a). The NAM 
generally becomes more positive by the end of the century except in boreal summer (JJA) when there is no 
change in the NAM in these simulations. In boreal winter (DJF) under SSP5-8.5, the central estimate is an 
increase in the NAM by almost 3 hPa in the long-term compared to 1995–2014. This can be compared to a 
multi-model mean interannual standard deviation in the winter NAM index of 3.4 hPa during the period 
1850–1900. We conclude with high confidence that in the mid- to long-term, the boreal wintertime surface 
NAM is more positive under SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, while under SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6, the NAM does 
not show any robust change. 
 
#### The Southern Annular Mode 
AR5 assessed it is likely that the evolution of the SAM over the 21st century will be primarily determined by 
the interplay between the effects of ozone recovery and changing GHG concentrations and influence the 
SAM in opposing ways. Owing to the relative effects of these two drivers, CMIP5 model SAM and SH 
circulation projections differed markedly across forcing scenarios and across seasons (Barnes and Polvani, 
2013; Barnes et al., 2014). CMIP5 models simulated a weak negative SAM trend in austral summer for 
RCP4.5 by the end of the century (Zheng et al., 2013a), while for RCP8.5 they simulated a weak positive 
SAM trend in austral summer (Zheng et al., 2013a). A substantial fraction of the spread in CMIP5 
projections of the end of century SH summer jet shift under RCP8.5 may be attributable to differences in the 
simulated change in break-up of the stratospheric polar vortex, with models that produce a later break-up 
date showing a larger summertime poleward jet shift (Ceppi and Shepherd, 2019b). For RCP2.6, the effect of 
ozone recovery on the SAM has been found to dominate over that of GHGs in austral summer (Eyring et al., 
2013). In austral winter, the poleward shift of the SH circulation in CMIP5 models, and the associated 
increase in the SAM index, tends to be larger, on average, in higher forcing scenarios though with substantial 
inter-model spread (Barnes et al., 2014). New research since the AR5 shows that the previous theory for the 
apparent relationship across models between the annual mean climatological SH jet position and the 
amplitude of forced SH jet shift (Kidston and Gerber, 2010) does not hold at seasonal timescales (Simpson 
and Polvani, 2016b). 
 
In most seasons, the SAM becomes more positive by the end of the century relative to 1995–2014 under 
SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 (Figure 4.30b). Conversely, under SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6, in most 
seasons the SAM index does not show a robust change compared to 1995–2014 except in austral summer 
when it becomes significantly more negative. The greatest change in the SAM occurs in austral winter, 
where CMIP6 models show an ensemble-mean increase in the SAM index of almost 5 hPa in SSP5-8.5. This 
can be compared to a multi-model mean interannual standard deviation in the austral winter SAM index of 
4.0 hPa during 1850–1900. In conclusion, there is high confidence that in high emission scenarios (SSP3-7.0 
and SSP5-8.5) the SAM becomes more positive in all seasons, while in the lowest scenario (SSP1-1.9) there 
is a robust decrease in austral summer.

### 4.5.3.2  El Niño-Southern Oscillation  
 
AR5 assessed that it is very likely that ENSO will remain the dominant mode of interannual variability in the 
future. Moreover, due to increased moisture availability, the associated precipitation variability on regional 
scales was assessed to likely intensify. An eastward shift in the patterns of temperature and precipitation 
variations in the North Pacific and North America related to El Niño and La Niña teleconnections was 
projected with medium confidence. The stability of teleconnections to other regional implications including 
those in Central and South America, the Caribbean, parts of Africa, most of Asia, Australia and most Pacific 
Islands were assessed to be uncertain (Christensen et al., 2013). 
 
There is no consensus on changes in amplitude of ENSO SST variability across CMIP iterations. The main 
factors driving the diversity of ENSO SST amplitude change in climate models are internal variability, SST 
mean warming pattern, and model systematic biases. First, pronounced low-frequency modulations of ENSO 
exist even in unforced control simulations due to internal variability, which leads a large uncertainty in 
quantifying future ENSO changes (Wittenberg, 2009; Vega-Westhoff and Sriver, 2017; Zheng et al., 2018). 
Second, ENSO characteristics depend on the climate mean state of the tropical Pacific; however, ENSO can 
also influence the mean state through nonlinear processes (Cai et al., 2015; Timmermann et al., 2018). The 
response of the tropical Pacific mean state to anthropogenic forcing is characterized by a faster warming on 
the equator compared to the off-equatorial region, a faster warming of the eastern equatorial Pacific 
compared to the central tropical Pacific (e.g., El Niño-like mean SST warming, see Chapter 7, Section 
7.4.4.2), and a weakening of the Walker circulation in most models. Those models with a El Niño-like 
warming tend to project a strengthening of ENSO SST variability whereas models with a La Niña-like 
warming tend to project a weakening of variability (Zheng et al., 2016; Kohyama and Hartmann, 2017; 
Wang et al., 2017b; Cai et al., 2018a; Fredriksen et al., 2020b). Third, how to take model biases into account 
leads to different ENSO changes. (Kim et al., 2014) suggested that a subset of CMIP5 models that simulate 
linear ENSO stability realistically exhibit a decrease in ENSO amplitude by the second half of the 21st 
century. However, an increase of ENSO SST variability has been projected when considering biases in 
ENSO pattern simulation by different models (Zheng et al., 2016; Cai et al., 2018a). This highlights the 
importance of constraining tropical Pacific mean state changes in order to enhance confidence in the 
projected response of ENSO. 
 
There is also no robust consensus on changes in ENSO diversity. Several studies suggest that an increase in 
Eastern Pacific (EP)-ENSO events tends to be projected particularly in the models with an El Niño-like 
warming (Zheng et al., 2016; Cai et al., 2018a; Fredriksen et al., 2020a). However, Freund et al. (2020) 
suggested that models with a El Niño-like mean warming show a tendency toward more Central Pacific (CP) 
events but fewer EP events compared to models with an La Niña-like warming in both CMIP5 and CMIP6 
models.  

Even though there is limited agreement in simulated changes in ENSO SST variability, the majority of 
models project an increase in amplitude of ENSO rainfall variability attributable to the increase in mean SST 
and moisture in CMIP5 (Power et al., 2013; Watanabe et al., 2014; Huang and Xie, 2015) and CMIP6 (Yun 
et al., 2021). It is likely that extreme El Niño events, accompanied by the eastern equatorial Pacific rainfall 
exceeding the 5mm day-1 rainfall threshold, will increase in intensity (Cai et al., 2014a, 2017). However, it 
has also been suggested that historical model biases over the equatorial Pacific cold tongue in CMIP5 may 
lead to the greater precipitation mean change and amplification of extreme ENSO-associated rainfall in 
CMIP5 (Stevenson et al., 2021). 
 
There is limited  intermodel agreement on future changes in ENSO teleconnections largely depending on 
changes in the mean state and changes in ENSO properties (Yeh et al., 2018a). Many CMIP5 and CMIP6 
models project that the centres of the extratropical teleconnection over North Pacific and North America will 
shift eastward in association with an eastward shift in tropical convective anomalies (Yeh et al., 2018b; 
Fredriksen et al., 2020a). There is an indication that tropical cyclones will become more frequent during 
future El Niño events (and less frequent during future La Niña events) by the end of the 21st century (Chand 
et al., 2017), thus contributing to the projected increase in ENSO-associated hydroclimate impacts. 
 
While CMIP6 models show no robust change in ENSO SST amplitude in the mid- and long-term period 
across all four SSPs, a robust increase in ENSO rainfall amplitude is found particularly in SSP2-4.5, SSP3-
7.0, and SSP5-8.5 (Figure 4.10). The changes in ENSO rainfall amplitude in the long-term future (2081–
2100) relative to the recent past (1995–2014) are statistically significant at the 95% confidence. 
 
To conclude, the forced change in ENSO SST variability is highly uncertain in CMIP5 and CMIP6 models 
(medium confidence). However, it is very likely that ENSO-related rainfall variability will increase 
significantly regardless of ENSO amplitude changes in the mid- and long-term future. It is likely that the 
pattern of ENSO teleconnection over the North Pacific and North America will shift eastward. 
 
 
### 4.5.3.3 Indian Ocean Basin and Dipole Modes
 
In the mid- to long-term, projected climate mean state changes in the tropical Indian Ocean are expected to 
resemble a positive IOD state, with faster warming in the west compared to the east (Cai et al., 2013; Zheng 
et al., 2013b). However, it was argued that this projected mean state change could be due to the large mean 
state biases in the simulated current climate and potentially not a realistic outcome (Li et al., 2016a). Mean 
state biases also lead to lack of consensus on projected equatorial Indian Ocean SST variability and 
equatorial modes of climate variability independent of the IOD (DiNezio et al., 2020). If mean state change 
will indeed resemble a positive IOD state, however, this would lead to a reduction in the amplitude 
difference between positive and negative IOD events, but with no robust change in IOD frequency (Cai et 
al., 2013). For a small subset of CMIP5 models that simulate IOD events best, a slight increase in IOD 
frequency was found under the CMIP5 RCP4.5 scenario (Chu et al., 2014) .  
 
However, it was also found that the frequency of extreme positive IOD events, which exhibit the largest 
climate impacts, might increase by a factor of about three under the CMIP5 RCP8.5 scenario (Cai et al., 
2014b). Partially consistent with the above result, a more recent study by (Cai et al., 2021) based on CMIP5 
RCP8.5 and CMIP6 SSP5-8.5 simulations shows a robust increased SST variability of large positive IOD 
events, but a decreased variability of moderate IOD events. An approximate doubling of these extreme 
positive IOD events was still found for global warming of 1.5°C warming above pre-industrial levels, 
without a projected decline thereafter (Cai et al., 2018b). These results depend, however, on the realism of 
the projected mean state change in the Indian Ocean (Li et al., 2016a). 
 
To conclude, the forced change in IOD in mid- and long-term future remains uncertain due to limited lines of 
evidence and its dependence on model mean biases. However, there is low confidence that the frequency of 
extreme positive IOD events will increase under the high-emission scenario of SSP5-8.5.  

### 4.5.3.4  Tropical Atlantic Modes  
 
AR5 assessed that there is low confidence in projected changes of the TAV because of the general failure of 
climate models to simulate main aspects of this variability such as the northward displaced ITCZ. The 
models that best represent the Atlantic meridional mode (AMM) show a weakening for future climate 
conditions. However, model biases in representation of Altantic Niños strongly limit an assessment of future 
changes.  
 
Long-term changes in TAVs and associated teleconnections are expected as a result of global warming, but 
large uncertainties exist due to the models’ systematic underestimation of the connection between PDV and 
Indo-Pacific SST variations (Lübbecke et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2019b). Observational analyses show large 
discrepancies in SST and trade winds strength (Servain et al., 2014; Mohino and Losada, 2015). Single-
model sensitivity experiments show that Atlantic Niño characteristics at the end of 21st century remain 
consistent with those of the 20th century, though changes in the climatological SSTs can lead to changes in 
the associated teleconnections (Mohino and Losada, 2015). 
 
The weakening of the AMOC expected from global warming (see Section 4.3.2.3) has been suggested to 
have an influence on the mean background state of tropical-Atlantic surface conditions, thereby enhancing 
equatorial Atlantic variability and  resulting in a stronger tropical Atlantic–ENSO teleconnection (Svendsen 
et al., 2014) (see Chapter 3 Section 3.7.5 for a detailed discussion). A recent multi-model study, based on 
CMIP5, concluded that the TAV-Pacific teleconnection will weaken under global warming due to the 
increased thermal stability of the atmosphere (Jia et al., 2019a). However, there is still a clear lack of model 
studies, and hence no robust evidence on the long-term evolution of TAV and associated teleconnections.  
 
 
### 4.5.3.5 Pacific Decadal Variability
 
AR5 assessed that there is low confidence in projections of future changes in Pacific decadal variability 
(PDV) due to the inability of CMIP5 models to represent the connection between PDV and Indo-Pacific SST 
variations. Because the PDV appears to encompass the combined effects of different dynamical processes 
operating at different timescales, representation of PDV in climate models remains a challenge (see Chapter 
3, Section 3.7.6) and its long-term evolution under climate change uncertain. 
 
In addition to uncertainty from the future evolution of the mechanisms that determined the PDV, it is also 
unclear how the background state in the Pacific Ocean will change due to time-varying radiative forcing, and 
how this change will interact with variability at interannual and low-frequency timescales (Fedorov et al., 
2020). Recent research suggests that the PDV will have a weaker amplitude and higher frequency with 
global warming (Zhang and Delworth, 2016; Xu and Hu, 2017; Geng et al., 2019). The former appears to be 
associated with a decrease in SST variability and the meridional gradient over the Kuroshio-Oyashio region, 
with a reduction in North Pacific wind stress and meandering of the subpolar/subtropical gyre interplay 
(Zhang and Delworth, 2016). The latter is hypothesized to rely on the enhanced ocean stratification and 
shallower mixed layers of a warmer climate, which would increase the phase speed of the westward-
propagating oceanic waves, hence shortening the decadal-interdecadal component (Goodman and Marshall, 
1999; Zhang and Delworth, 2016; Xu and Hu, 2017). The weakening of the PDV in a warmer climate may 
reduce the internal variability of global mean surface temperature, to which PDV seems associated (Zhang et 
al., 1997; Kosaka and Xie, 2016; Geng et al., 2019). Thus, a weaker and higher frequency PDV could reduce 
the contribution of internal variability to the GSAT trend and eventually lead to a reduced probability of 
surface-warming hiatus events.  
 
In summary, based on CMIP5, there is medium confidence that a weaker and higher frequency PDV is 
expected under global warming. 
 

### 4.5.3.6  Atlantic Multidecadal Variability  
 
Based on paleoclimate reconstructions and model simulations, AR5 assessed that AMV is unlikely to change 
its behaviour in the future. However, AMV fluctuations over the coming decades are likely to influence 
regional climate, enhancing or offsetting some of the effects of global warming.  
 
Recent proxy-derived reconstructions of AMV-related signals show persistent multi-decadal variability over 
the last three centuries (Kilbourne et al., 2014; Svendsen et al., 2014; Moore et al., 2017), up to the last 
millennium (Chylek et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017b) and beyond (Knudsen et al., 2011). 
This implies that in the past AMV properties were little affected by large climatic excursions. 
 
AMV long-term changes under future warming scenarios have been so far scarcely investigated. A study on 
the CMIP5 multi-model simulations under RCP8.5 scenario by (Villamayor et al., 2018) found no substantial 
differences in the simulated SST patterns (and in the related tropical rainfall response) when RCP8.5, 
historical and piControl simulations are compared. Such results suggest that the AMV is not expected to 
change under global warming. A more recent single-model large ensemble study (Hand et al., 2020) shows a 
pronounced change in the AMV pattern under global warming linked to a strong reduction of the mean 
AMOC and its variability. However, since a superposition of multiple processes controls the AMV, as 
extensively discussed in Annex IV, Section AIV.2.7, in Chapter 3 (Section 3.7.7), and in Chapter 9 (Section 
9.2.3.1), the length of the RCP8.5 simulations might be not sufficient to properly evaluate the respective 
weight and interplay of internal components and influences from external forcing on AMV projections.  
 
In conclusion, on the basis of paleoclimate reconstructions and CMIP5 model simulations, there is low 
confidence that the AMV is not expected to change in the future.  
 
 
# 4.6 Implications of Climate Policy
 
## 4.6.1  Patterns of Climate Change for Specific Levels of Global  
 
This subsection provides an assessment of changes in climate at 1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C, and 4°C of global warming 
relative to the period 1850–1900 (see Chapter 1, Section 1.6.2), in particular a discussion of the regional 
patterns of change in temperature (Section 4.6.1.1), precipitation (Section 4.6.1.2), and aspects of 
atmospheric circulation (Section 4.6.1.3). An assessment of changes in extreme weather events as a function 
of different levels of global warming is provided in Chapter 11, while corresponding analyses of regional 
climate change are provided in Chapter 12 and in Atlas. This section builds upon assessments from AR5 
(Bindoff et al., 2013; Christensen et al., 2013; Collins et al., 2013; Hartmann et al., 2013) and SR1.5 (SR1.5; 
Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018), as well as new literature related to projections of climate at 1.5°C, 2°C, and 
higher levels of global warming above pre-industrial levels.  
 
Several methodologies have been applied to estimate the spatial patterns of climate change associated with a 
given level of global warming. These include performing model simulations under stabilisation scenarios 
designed to achieve a specific level of global warming, the analysis of epochs identified within transient 
simulations that systematically exceed different thresholds of global warming (e.g. Dosio et al., 2018; 
Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018), Kjellström et al., 2018; Mitchell et al., 2017), and analysis based on statistical 
methodologies that include empirical scaling relationships (ESR) (Dosio and Fischer, 2018)(Schleussner et 
al., 2017)(Seneviratne et al., 2018) and statistical pattern scaling (e.g., Kharin et al., 2018). These different 
methodologies are assessed in some detail in Section 4.2.5 (see also James et al., 2017) and generally 
provide qualitatively consistent results regarding changes in the spatial patterns of temperature and rainfall 
means and extremes (see Chapter 11) at different levels of global warming. 
 
In this subsection, we present the projected patterns of climate change obtained following the epoch 
approach (also called the time-shift method, see Section 4.2.4) under the Tier 1 SSPs (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, 
SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5). For each model simulation considered under each of these SSPs, 20-year moving 
averages of the global average atmospheric surface temperature are first constructed, then this time series is 
used to detect the first year during when GSAT exceeds the 1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C and 4°C thresholds with respect 
to the 1850–1900 (Cross-Chapter Box 11.1). The temperature thresholds are not exceeded in all the model 
simulations across the Tier 1 SSPs, that is, decreasing numbers of simulations are available for the analysis 
of patterns of change as the temperature threshold increases. For each simulation within which a given 
temperature threshold is exceeded, a 20-year global climatology is subsequently constructed to represent that 
level of global warming, centred on the year for which the threshold was first exceeded. The composite of all 
such climatologies across the Tier 1 SSPs and model simulations constitute the spatial patterns of change for 
a given temperature threshold. Some of the complexities of scaling patterns of climate change with different 
levels of global warming are also discussed in the following sections. These include overshoot versus 
stabilization scenarios and limitations of pattern scaling for strong mitigation and stabilization scenarios 
(Tebaldi and Arblaster, 2014). At least for the case of annual mean temperature and precipitation, strong 
evidence exists that even for strong mitigation and stabilization scenarios, patterns of change at lower levels 
of warming scale similarly to those reconstructed from transient simulations using either standard pattern-
correlation or time-shift methodologies (Tebaldi and Knutti, 2018).  
 
Pattern scaling performance based on scenario experiments is generally better for near-surface temperature 
than for precipitation (Ishizaki et al., 2013). For precipitation, rapid adjustments due to different forcing 
agents must be accounted for (Richardson et al., 2016). Possible non-linear responses to different forcing 
levels are also important (Good et al., 2015, 2016). Pattern scaling does not work as well at high forcing 
levels (Osborn et al., 2018). It is also important to distinguish the forced response from internal variability 
when comparing similar warming levels (Suarez-Gutierrez et al., 2018). The purpose of this section is not to 
repeat the analysis for all the variables considered in Sections 4.4 and 4.5, but rather to show a selected 
number of key variables that are important from the perspective of understanding the response of the 
physical climate system to different levels of warming. 
 
 
### 4.6.1.1  Temperature 
 
Global warming of 1.5°C implies higher mean temperatures compared to 1850–1900, with generally higher 
warming over land compared to ocean areas (virtually certain) and larger warming in high latitudes 
compared to low latitudes (Figure 4.31). In addition, global warming of 2°C versus 1.5°C results in robust 
increases in the mean temperatures in almost all locations, both on land and in the ocean (virtually certain), 
with subsequent further warming at almost all locations at higher levels of global warming (virtually certain) 
(Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). For each particular level of global warming, relatively larger mean warming 
is projected for land regions (virtually certain, see Figure 4.31; Christensen et al., 2013; Collins et al., 2013; 
Seneviratne et al., 2016). The projected changes at 1.5°C and 2°C global warming are consistent with 
observed historical global trends in temperature and their attribution to anthropogenic forcing (see Chapter 
3), as well as with observed changes under the recent global warming of 0.5°C (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 
2018; Schleussner et al., 2017). That is, spatial patterns of temperature changes associated with the 0.5°C 
difference in GMST warming between 1991–2010 and 1960–1979 (Schleussner et al., 2017; SR1.5) are 
consistent with projected changes under 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming.  
 
The largest increase in annual mean temperature is found in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere 
(NH) across all levels of global warming (virtually certain; Figure 4.31). This phenomenon peaks in the 
Arctic and is known as Arctic amplification, with the underlying physical mechanisms assessed in detail in 
Section 4.5.1 and Chapter 7, Section 7.4.4.1. For the CMIP6 ensemble average considered here, Arctic 
annual mean temperatures warm by a factor of 2.3, 2.5, 2.4 and 2.4 for 1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C and 4°C of global 
warming, respectively. That is, Arctic warming scales approximately linearly with GSAT. Generally, when 
Arctic amplification is considered across individual models, warming occurs at a factor of 2–4 times the 
global level of warming. It is unlikely that warming in the SH high latitudes in the 21st century will exceed 
the change in GSAT, or that it will substantially exceed warming in the tropics, for GSAT change ranging 
between 1.5°C and 4°C (Figure 4.31, Table 4.2). Correspondingly, there is low confidence of Antarctic 
amplification occurring under transient, 21st century low mitigation scenarios (Table 4.2; Chapter 7, Section 
7.4.4.1). The Antarctic continent is projected to warm at a higher rate than the mid-latitude Southern Ocean, 
however, at all levels of global warming (Figure 4.31). The relevant physical mechanisms that reduce the 
amplitude of polar amplification over Antarctica compared to the Arctic are assessed in detail in Section 
4.5.1 and Chapter 7, Section 7.4.4.1. In the SH the strongest warming over land is to occur, at any given 
level of global warming, over the subtropical areas of South America, southern Africa and Australia (high 
confidence). The relatively strong warming in subtropical southern Africa may be attributed to strong soil-
moisture–temperature coupling and projected increased dryness under enhanced subsidence (Engelbrecht et 
al., 2015; Vogel et al., 2017). Across the globe, in the tropics, subtropics, and mid- to high latitudes, 
temperatures tend to scale linearly with the level of increase in GSAT and patterns of change are largely 
scenario independent (high confidence). 
 
<figref>4.31</figref> 
 
### 4.6.1.2  Precipitation 
 
While global mean precipitation increases as GSAT rises with the very likely range of 1–3% per 1°C (high 
confidence, see Sections 8.2.1 and 8.4.1), patterns of precipitation change do not scale as linearly with GSAT 
increase. Nevertheless, common features of precipitation change in the multi-model mean across scenarios 
still exist for different levels of global warming (Figure 4.32). Precipitation will very likely increase in the 
high latitudes and over tropical regions, and likely increase in large parts of the monsoon region, but likely 
decrease over the subtropical regions, including the Mediterranean, southern Africa, parts of Australia and 
South America at all four levels of global warming. The increases and decreases in precipitation will amplify 
at higher levels of global warming (high confidence) (Figure 4.32). Changes in extreme precipitation events 
under different levels of global warming are assessed in Chapter 11. 
 
<figref>4.32</figref> 
 
SR1.5 stated low confidence regarding changes in global monsoons at 1.5°C versus 2°C of global warming, 
as well as differences in monsoon responses at 1.5°C versus 2°C. Generally, statistically significant changes 
in regional annual average precipitation are expected at a global mean warming of 2.5°C–3°C or more 
(Tebaldi et al., 2015). Over the Austral-winter rainfall regions of south-western South America, South Africa 
and Australia, projected decreases in mean annual rainfall show high agreement across models and a strong 
climate change signal even under 1.5°C of global warming, with further amplification of the signal at higher 
levels of global warming (Mindlin et al., 2020) (high confidence). This is a signal evident in observed 
rainfall trends over these regions (see Chapter 2, Section 2.3.1.3, and Chapter 8, Section 8.3.1.6 ). Also, over 
the Asian monsoon regions, increases in rainfall will occur at 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming (Chevuturi et 
al., 2018). At warming levels of 1.5°C and 2°C, the changes in global monsoons are strongly dependent on 
the modelling strategies used, such as fully coupled transient, fully coupled quasi-equilibrium, and 
atmosphere-only quasi-equilibrium simulations. In particular, the differences of regional monsoon changes 
among model setups are dominated by strategy choics such as transient versus quasi-equilibrium set-up, 
prescription of SST, and treatment of aerosols (Zhang and Zhou, 2021). 
 
<figref>4.33</figref> 
 
The global and land area fractions with significant precipitation changes with global warming are shown in 
Figure 4.33. It is virtually certain that average warming will be higher over land. As warming increases, a 
larger global and land area will experience statistically significant increases or decreases in precipitation 
(medium confidence). The increase of the area fraction with significant precipitation increase is larger over 
land than over the ocean, but the increase of the area fraction with significant precipitation decrease is larger 
over the ocean than over land (Figure 4.33). Precipitation variability in most climate models increases over 
the global land area in response to warming (Pendergrass et al., 2017).  
 
In summary, based on the assessment of CMIP6 models, there is high confidence that global mean 
precipitation will increase with increase in global mean surface temperature. Precipitation will very likely 
increase in the high latitudes and over tropical regions, likely increase in large parts of the monsoon region, 
but will likely decrease over the subtropical regions. There is high confidence that increases and decreases in 
precipitation will amplify over higher levels of global warming . As warming increases, there is medium 
confidence that a larger land area will experience statistically significant increases or decreases in 
precipitation.   
 
 
### 4.6.1.3  Atmospheric Circulation 
 
AR5 reported that the application of pattern scaling to extract information on variables other than surface 
temperature and precipitation was relatively unexplored. Since AR5, new studies have examined the 
relationship between projections of mid-latitude atmospheric circulation and GSAT both in terms of 
interpreting spread in responses across the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble (Grise and Polvani, 2014a, 2016) 
and to investigate variations in the circulation response as a function of GSAT change over time within a 
given forcing experiment (Grise and Polvani, 2017; Ceppi et al., 2018).  
 
At a fixed time horizon, the CMIP5 multi-model spread in GSAT explains only a small fraction of the spread 
in the shift of the NH mid-latitude circulation due to an abrupt quadrupling in CO2 (Grise and Polvani, 2016). 
The fraction of model spread explained by GSAT in the shift of the SH circulation is larger, but still fairly 
small (Grise and Polvani, 2014a, 2016). At a fixed time horizon and for a given emission scenario, CMIP5 
multi-model spread in storm track shifts, and the closely related mid-latitude jets, can be better explained by 
multi-model spread in lower and upper level meridional temperature gradients than by GSAT (Harvey et al., 
2014; Grise and Polvani, 2016).  
 
The transient response of the mid-latitude jets to forcing in the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Southern 
Hemisphere behaves nonlinearly with GSAT (Grise and Polvani, 2017; Ceppi et al., 2018). This is a 
consequence of the time-dependence of the relationship between radiative forcing and GSAT and the 
temporal evolution of SST patterns (Ceppi et al., 2018), with a potential seasonal component in the SH 
associated with polar stratospheric temperature changes (Grise and Polvani, 2017). Consequently, the epoch 
approach applied to a transient simulation of the 21st century will overestimate the mid-latitude circulation 
response in a stabilized climate. Dedicated time slice experiments simulating stabilized climates are therefore 
required to assess differences in mid-latitude circulation at given levels of global warming (Li et al., 2018). 
A further complication in the SH is the competing influences of ozone recovery and increasing GHG 
concentrations on the austral-summer mid-latitude circulation during the first half the 21st century (Barnes 
and Polvani, 2013; Barnes et al., 2014). Using transient 21st century experiments to diagnose changes in SH 
mid-latitude circulation at different levels of warming therefore confounds the effects of ozone recovery and 
GHG increases (Ceppi et al., 2018). Given these various limitations, we do not apply epoch analysis to 
assess mid-latitude atmospheric circulation changes and related annular modes of variability. 
 
 
## 4.6.2  Climate Goals, Overshoot, and Path-Dependence  
 
Many scenarios aiming at limiting warming by 2100 to 1.5°C involve overshoot – ERF temporarily exceeds 
a certain level before peaking and declining again (see also Annex VII: Glossary). To quantify the 
implications of any such overshoot, this subsection assesses reversibility of climate due to temporary 
overshoot of GSAT levels during the 21st century, and implications for the use of carbon budgets. It also 
assesses differences in climate outcomes under different pathways, with a focus on comparing the SSPs used 
in CMIP6 with the RCPs used in CMIP5. 
 
 
### 4.6.2.1  Climate change under overshoot 
 
The SR1.5 (IPCC, 2018) concluded with high confidence that overshoot trajectories ‘result in higher impacts 
and associated challenges compared to pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited 
overshoot’. The degree and duration of overshoot affects the risks and impacts likely to be experienced 
(Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018) and the emissions pathway required to achieve it (Akimoto et al., 2018). 
Consequences such as on ice sheets and climatic extremes have been found to be greater at 2°C of global 
warming than at 1.5°C (Schleussner et al., 2016; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018) but even on recovery to lower 
temperatures, these effects may not reverse. Overshoot has been found to lead to irreversible changes in 
thermosteric sea-level (Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; Palter et al., 2018; Tachiiri et al., 2019), AMOC (Palter 
et al., 2018), ice-sheets, and permafrost carbon (Section 4.7.2, Chapter 5, Section 5.4.9) and to long-lasting 
effects on ocean heat (Tsutsui et al., 2006a). Abrupt changes and tipping points are not well understood, but 
the higher the warming level and the longer the duration of overshoot, the greater the risk of unexpected 
changes (see sections 4.7.2). Non-reversal of the hydrological cycle has also been found in some studies with 
an increase in global precipitation following CO2 decrease being attributed to a build-up of ocean heat (Wu 
et al., 2010), and to a fast atmospheric adjustment to CO2 radiative forcing (Cao et al., 2011a). 
 
Global temperature is expected to remain approximately constant if emissions of CO2 were to cease (Section 
4.7.1.1), and so reductions in GSAT are only possible in the event of net negative global CO2 emissions. We 
assess here results from an overshoot scenario (SSP5-3.4-OS; O’Neill et al., 2016), which explores the 
implications of a peak and decline in forcing during the 21st century. Reversibility under more extreme and 
idealised carbon dioxide removal (CDR) scenarios is assessed in Section 4.6.3. In SSP5-3.4-OS, CO2 peaks 
at 571 ppm in the year 2062 and reverts to 497 ppm by 2100 – approximately the same level as in 2040. 
SSP5-3.4-OS has strong net negative emissions of CO2, exceeding those in SSP1-2.6 and SSP1-1.9 from 
2070 onwards and reaching –5.5 PgC yr-1 (–20 GtCO2 yr-1) by 2100. While this causes global mean 
temperature to decline, changes in climate have not fully reversed by 2100 under this reversal of CO2 
concentration (Figure 4.34). Quantities are compared for 2081–2100 relative to a 20-year period (2034–
2053) of the same average CO2. Differences between these two periods of the same CO2 are: GSAT: 
0.28±0.30°C (mean ± standard deviation); global land precipitation: 0.026±0.011 mm/day; September Arctic 
sea-ice area: –0.32±0.53 million km2; thermosteric sea-level: 12±0.8 cm. As assessed in Section 9.3.1.1, 
Arctic sea-ice area is linearly reversible with GSAT. Although these climate quantities are not fully 
reversible, the overshoot scenario results in reduced climate change compared with stabilisation or continued 
increase in greenhouse gases (Tsutsui et al., 2006b; Palter et al., 2018; Tachiiri et al., 2019) (high 
confidence). 
 
<figref>4.34</figref> 
 
The transient climate response to cumulative carbon (CO2) emissions, TCRE, allows climate policy goals to 
be associated with remaining carbon budgets as global temperature increase is near-linear with cumulative 
emissions (Section 5.5). Research since AR5 has shown that the concept of near-linearity of climate change 
to cumulative carbon emissions holds for measures other than just GSAT, such as regional climate (Leduc et 
al., 2016) or extremes (Harrington et al., 2016)(Seneviratne et al., 2016). However, ocean heat and carbon 
uptake do exhibit path dependence, leading to deviation from the TCRE relationship for levels of overshoot 
above 300 PgC (Zickfeld et al., 2016; Tokarska et al., 2019). Sea-level rise, loss of ice-sheets, and 
permafrost carbon release may not reverse under overshoot and recovery of GSAT and cumulative emissions 
(Section 4.7). TCRE remains a valuable concept to assess climate policy goals and how to achieve them but 
given the non-reversibility of different climate metrics with CO2 and GSAT reductions, it has limitations 
associated with evaluating the climate response under overshoot scenarios and CO2 removal (medium 
confidence). 
 
 
### 4.6.2.2  Consistency between Shared Socioeconomic Pathways and Representative Concentration 

 As CMIP5 and CMIP6 employed different scenario sets (RCPs and SSPs, respectively – see Section 1.6.1.1, 
Cross-Chapter Box 1.4), we assess how much of the differences in projections are due to the scenario change 
and how much due to model changes. CMIP6-simulated GSAT increases tend to be larger than in CMIP5, 
for nominally comparable scenarios ((Tebaldi et al., 2021), see Section 4.3.1).  
 
The radiative forcing labels on SSP and RCP scenarios is approximate and enables the multiple climate 
forcings within the scenario to be characterised by a single number. While the scenarios are similar in terms 
of the stratospheric adjusted radiative forcing (Tebaldi et al., 2021), they differ more in their effective 
radiative forcing (ERF). The combination of component forcings (CO2, non-CO2 greenhouse gases, aerosols) 
within the scenario also differ (Meinshausen et al., 2020). The ERF levels in the RCP and SSP scenarios 
have been calculated by sampling uncertainty in forcing from a range of different GHG species and aerosols 
(see 7.SM.1.4 for details). Figure 4.35 shows the time evolution and 2081–2100 mean across the families of 
scenarios and how this affects projections of GSAT. That the ERFs differ between corresponding SSP and 
RCP scenarios makes comparison between CMIP6 and CMIP5 projections challenging (Tebaldi et al., 2021). 
(Wyser et al., 2020) find the EC-Earth3-Veg model exhibits stronger radiative forcing and substantially 
greater warming under SSP5-8.5 than RCP8.5, and similar, but smaller additional warmings for SSP2-4.5 
and SSP1-2.6 compared with RCP4.5 and RCP2.6, respectively. In addition to the global response, climate 
can vary regionally due to non-CO2 components of forcing (Samset et al., 2016; Richardson et al., 2018b, 
2018a). 
 
Emulators (Cross-Chapter Box 7.1) can be used to aid understanding of differences between generations of 
scenarios. AR5 (Collins et al., 2013) explored the differences between CMIP3 and CMIP5 (their Figure 
12.40). Here we use an emulator calibrated to AR6 assessed GSAT ranges, thus eliminating the effect of 
differences in the model ensembles, to analyse the differences between SSP and RCP scenarios. 
MAGICC7.5 in its WGIII-calibrated setup (see Cross Chapter Box 7.1) projects differences in 2081–2100 
mean warming between the RCP2.6 and SSP1-2.6 scenarios of around 0.2°C, between RCP4.5 and SSP2-4.5 
of around 0.3°C and between RCP8.5 and SSP5-8.5 of around 0.3°C (Figure 4.35b). The SSP scenarios also 
have a wider 5–95% range simulated by MAGICC7.5 explaining about half of the increased range seen 
when comparing CMIP5 and CMIP6 models. Higher climate sensitivity is, though, the primary reason 
behind the upper end of the warming for SSP5-8.5 reaching 1.5°C higher than the CMIP5 results. Compared 
with the differences between the CMIP5 and CMIP6 multi-model ensembles for the same scenario pairs 
(Table A6 in Tebaldi et al., 2021), the higher ERFs of the SSP scenarios contribute approximately half of the 
warmer CMIP6 SSP outcomes (medium confidence).   
 
In summary, there is medium confidence that about half of the warming increase in CMIP6 compared to 
CMIP5 is due to higher climate sensitivity in CMIP6 models; the other half arises from higher ERF in 
nominally comparable scenarios (e.g., RCP8.5 and SSP5-8.5).

## 4.6.3  Climate Response to mitigation, Carbon Dioxide Removal, and Solar Radiation Modification  
 
Most strong-mitigation scenarios assume – in addition to emissions reductions – some form of carbon 
dioxide removal (CDR) – anthropogenic activities that remove CO2 from the atmosphere and durably store it 
in geological, terrestrial, or ocean reservoirs, or in products (see Annex VII: Glossary). SR1.5 (Rogelj et al., 
2018b) assessed that all pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C by 2100 with no or limited overshoot use 
CDR. In the SSP class of scenarios, SSP1-1.9 is characterized by a rapid decline of net CO2  emissions to 
zero by 2050 and net negative CO2  emissions in the second half of this century (O’Neill et al., 2016; Rogelj 
et al., 2018a), implying the use of CDR. The term ‘net CO2 emissions’ refers to the difference between 
anthropogenic CO2 emissions and removal by CDR options, and ‘net negative CO2 emissions’ imply a 
scenario where CO2 removal exceeds emissions (van Vuuren et al., 2011) (van Vuuren et al., 2016). The 
terms ‘negative emissions’ and ‘net negative emissions’ refer to and include all GHGs (see Annex VII: 
Glossary).  
 
Climate change can be also offset by solar radiation modification (SRM) measures that modify the Earth’s 
radiation budget to reduce global warming (see Annex VII: Glossary). CDR and SRM approaches have been 
together referred to as ‘geoengineering’ or ‘climate engineering’ in the literature (The Royal Society, 2009; 
NRC, 2015a, 2015b; Schäfer et al., 2015). However, following SR1.5 (de Coninck et al., 2018), these terms 
inconsistently used in the literature, so that CDR and SRM are explicitly differentiated here. SRM contrasts 
with climate mitigation because it introduces a ‘mask’ to the climate change problem by altering the Earth’s 
radiation budget, rather than attempting to address the root cause of the problem, which is the increase in 
GHGs in the atmosphere. 
 
Section 4.6.3.1 assesses the emergence of the climate response to mitigation, which is reflected by the 
difference between high- and low-emission scenarios. Section 4.6.3.2 then assesses the climate response to 
mitigation through CDR options, usually assumed against the background of some emission scenario; note 
that the CDR options themselves are assessed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.6.2). Section 4.6.3.3 assesses the 
climate system response to SRM options. The biogeochemical implications of CDR and SRM are assessed in 
Chapter 5 (Sections 5.6.2 and 5.6.3, respectively). The importance of CDR for reaching net zero or negative 
CO2 emissions in mitigation pathways is assessed in the AR6 WGIII report (Chapters 3, 4, 6, 7 and 12). The 
risks for and impacts on human and natural systems due to SRM are assessed in the AR6 WGII report 
(Chapter 16), and the international governance issues related to SRM and CDR are assessed in the AR6 
WGIII report (Chapter 14).  
 
 
### 4.6.3.1  Emergence of the climate response to mitigation 
 
Reducing GHG emissions will eventually slow and limit the degree of climate change relative to high-
emission scenarios such as SSP5-8.5 (very high confidence). Even when CO2 emissions are reduced, 
however, atmospheric CO2 concentrations continue to increase as long as emissions exceed removal by sinks 
(Millar et al., 2017). Surface warming would likewise initially continue under scenarios of decreasing 
emissions, resulting in a substantial lag between a peak in CO2 emissions and peak warming (Ricke and 
Caldeira, 2014; Zickfeld and Herrington, 2015) (high confidence). The lag between peak emissions and 
warming depends on the emissions history prior to the peak and also on the rate of the subsequent emissions 
reductions (Matthews, 2010; Ricke and Caldeira, 2014; Zickfeld and Herrington, 2015).  
 
In addition to the lag between peak emissions and peak warming, the climate response to reduced emissions 
would be overlain by internal variability, which can amplify or attenuate the forced response. The resulting 
masking of differences between scenarios is illustrated in Figure 4.36 for GSAT trends over 2021–2040 
(Maher et al., 2020). The overall trends conform to expectations in that most simulations show warming 
almost everywhere, especially under scenario RCP8.5 (Figure 4.36 bottom row). But any individual grid 
point can in principle show no warming or even cooling, even under RCP 8.5, over the near term (Figure 
4.36 middle row). The magnitude of pointwise maximum and minimum temperature trends can be as large as 
0.5°C per year (Figure 4.36 top and middle rows), exceeding possible trends in the global mean by one order 
of magnitude. While it is only a small fraction of the surface that simultaneously can show cooling, cooling 
at any given location is fully consistent with globally averaged surface warming over the near term (high 
confidence, since the findings of (Maher et al., 2020) are consistent across six different large initial-condition 
ensembles).  
 
<figref>4.36</figref> 
 
An important development since AR5 has been the quantification of when the climate response to mitigation 
can be expected to emerge from the background noise of internal variability (illustrated in Figure 4.36; see 
Section 1.4.2.2, see also Annex VII: Glossary). A basic ambiguity arises because once mitigation measures 
are in place, it is no longer possible to observe what the climate would have been without these measures, 
and any statement about emergence of the response to mitigation is contingent upon the assumed strength of 
mitigation in relation to an assumed (‘counterfactual’) no-mitigation scenario. Still, there is high agreement 
on the emergence of the climate response to mitigation across a number of independent studies using 
different models and different statistical approaches.  
 
Among global quantities, emergence of the response to differing CO2 emissions – representing differences 
between low- and high-emission scenarios – is first expected to arise in global-mean CO2 concentrations, 
about 10 years after emission pathways have started diverging (Tebaldi and Friedlingstein, 2013; Peters et 
al., 2017; Schwartzman and Keeling, 2020; Spring et al., 2020) (high confidence). In these studies, 
emergence is generally defined as the time at which the global mean concentration first differs between 
mitigation and non-mitigation scenarios by more than two standard deviations of internal variability, 
although there are some methodological differences. 
 
Emergence in GSAT would be delayed further, owing to the inertia in the climate system. Although not 
investigating emergence as defined here in AR6, (Tebaldi et al., 2021) used 20-year running-mean GSAT 
and compared pairwise either model-by-model or between CM IP6 ensemble means from the core set of five 
scenarios assessed in this chapter. Differences by more than 0.1°C showed up in most cases in the near 
term, with only some of the individual models and the comparisons of the closest scenarios showing a delay 
until the mid-term. Taking internal variability explicitly into account, (Tebaldi and Friedlingstein, 2013) and 
(Samset et al., 2020) found emergence of mitigation benefits in GSAT changes about 25–30 years after 
RCP2.6 emissions diverge from the higher-emissions trajectories in RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Consistently, 
(Marotzke, 2019) found about one-third likelihood that a trend reduction in GSAT, over the period 2021–
2035 relative to 2005–2020, would be attributable to the emissions reductions implied by the difference 
between RCP2.6 and RCP4.5. Emergence of the GSAT response to mitigation of individual short-lived 
climate forcers (SLCFs) would likewise not occur until several decades after emissions trajectories diverge, 
owing to the relatively small influence of individual SLCFs on the total ERF (Samset et al., 2020), see also 
Section 4.4.4 and Figure 4.18.  
 
In contrast to the earlier studies, emergence in GSAT within the near- term has recently been found by 
(McKenna et al., 2021) who investigated the likelihood that under the SSP scenarios GSAT trends will 
exceed the largest historical observed 20-year trends. They found that under scenario SSP1-1.9, the 20-year 
GSAT trends would likely be lower than in SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 within the near term. This earlier 
diagnosed time of emergence compared to (Marotzke, 2019), while using a similar statistical approach, 
presumably arose because of the longer-period trends (20 rather than 15 years) and the larger difference 
between emissions trajectories considered (medium confidence). Using 20-year temperature anomalies 
relative to 1995–2014 instead of 20-year trends yielded a low probability of emergence (McKenna et al., 
2021), consistent with the AR5 (Collins et al., 2013; Kirtman et al., 2013), (Tebaldi and Friedlingstein, 2013) 
(Samset et al., 2020). It is not yet understood why GSAT trends appear to show faster emergence of 
mitigation benefits, compared to GSAT anomalies.  
 
Emergence of mitigation benefits has been studied much less for quantities other than globally and annually 
averaged CO2 concentration and surface temperature. Boreal-winter temperatures are more challenging for 
emergence, due to larger variability in boreal winter and adding a decade to the time of emergence, whereas 
emergence times for boreal-summer averages are similar to the annual temperature averages (Tebaldi and 
Friedlingstein, 2013). Emergence happens later at the regional scale, with a median time of emergence of 
30–45 years after emission paths separate in RCP2.6 relative to RCP4.5 and RCP8.5; a stricter requirement 
of 95% confidence level instead of median induces a delay of several decades, bringing time of emergence 
toward the end of the 21st century at regional scales (Tebaldi and Friedlingstein, 2013).  
 
Attribution to emissions reductions, for the case of RCP2.6 relative to RCP4.5, is not substantially more 
likely for 2021–2035 trends in  upper-2000m OHC than for GSAT (Marotzke, 2019), although OHC change 
is thought to be less susceptible to internal variability. Furthermore, (Marotzke, 2019) found only around 
10% likelihood of mitigation-benefit emergence during 2021–2035 for change in AMOC and September 
Arctic sea-ice area. (Tebaldi and Wehner, 2018) showed that the differences in temperature extremes 
between RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 over all land areas become statistically significant by 2050. The seemingly 
contrasting result of (Ciavarella et al., 2017) that mitigation benefits arise earlier for climate extremes poses 
no contradiction, because (Ciavarella et al., 2017) did not look at emergence as defined here but at the 
extremes of a distribution, which differ between scenarios already at a time when the distributions are still 
largely overlapping.  
 
In summary, if strong mitigation is applied from 2020 onward as reflected in SSP1-1.9, its effect on 20-year 
trends in GSAT would likely emerge during the near term, measured against an assumed non-mitigation 
scenario such as SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5. However, the response of many other climate quantities to 
mitigation would be largely masked by internal variability during the near term, especially on the regional 
scale (high confidence). The mitigation benefits for these quantities would emerge only later during the 21st 
century (high confidence). During the near term, a small fraction of the surface can show cooling under all 
scenarios assessed here, so near-term cooling at any given location is fully consistent with globally averaged 
surface warming (high confidence). 
 
### 4.6.3.2  Climate Response to Mitigation by Carbon Dioxide Removal 
 
CDR options include afforestation, soil carbon sequestration, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage 
(BECCS), wet land restoration, ocean fertilization, ocean alkalinisation, enhanced terrestrial weathering and 
direct air capture and storage (see Chapter 5, Section 5.6.2 and Table 5.9 for a more complete discussion). 
Chapter 8 (Section 8.4.3) assesses the implications of CDR for water cycle changes. The potential of 
different CDR options in terms of the amount of CO2 removed per year from the atmosphere, costs, co-
benefits and side effects of the CDR approaches are assessed in the SR1.5 (de Coninck et al., 2018), the AR6 
WGIII report (see Chapters 7 and 12), and in several review papers (Fuss et al., 2018; Lawrence et al., 2018; 
Nemet et al., 2018). In the literature, CDR options are also referred to as ‘negative CO2 emission 
technologies’.  
 
Deployment of CDR will lead to a reduction in atmospheric CO2 levels only if uptake by sinks exceeds net 
CO2 emissions. Hence, there could be a substantial delay between the initiation of CDR and net CO2 
emissions turning negative (van Vuuren et al., 2016), and the time to reach net negative CO2 emissions and 
the evolution of atmospheric CO2 and climate thereafter would depend on the combined pathways of 
anthropogenic CO2 emissions, CDR, and natural sinks. The cooling (or avoided warming) due to CDR would 
be proportional to the cumulative amount of CO2 removed from the atmosphere by CDR (Tokarska and 
Zickfeld, 2015; Zickfeld et al., 2016), as implied by the near-linear relationship between cumulative carbon 
emissions and GSAT change (see Section 5.5) 
 
Emission pathways that limit globally averaged warming to 1.5°C or 2°C by the year 2100 assume the use of 
CDR approaches in combination with emission reductions to follow net negative CO2 emissions trajectory in 
the second half of this century. For instance, in SR1.5, all analysed pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C by 
2100 with no or limited overshoot include the use of CDR to some extent to offset anthropogenic CO2 
emissions  and the median of CO2 removal across all scenarios was 730 GtCO2 in the 21st century (Rogelj et 
al., 2018b) (Rickels et al., 2018). Affordable and environmentally and socially acceptable CDR options at 
scale well before 2050 are an important element of 1.5°C-consistent pathways especially in overshoot 
scenarios (de Coninck et al., 2018). The required scale of removal by CDR can vary from 1–2  GtCO2 per 
year from 2050 onwards to as much as 20 GtCO2 p`er year (Waisman et al., 2019). In the SSP class of 
scenarios, net CO2 emissions turn negative from around 2050 in SSP1-1.9 and around 2070 in SSP1-2.6 and 
in the overshoot scenario SSP5-3.4-OS (O’Neill et al., 2016). Thus, CDR would play a pivotal role in 
limiting climate warming to 1.5°C or 2°C (Minx et al., 2018). In stark contrast, however, two extensive 
reviews (Lawrence et al., 2018; Nemet et al., 2018) conclude that it is implausible that any CDR technique 
can be implemented at scale that is needed by 2050.  
 
When CDR is applied continuously and at scales as large as currently deemed possible, under RCP8.5 as the 
background scenario, the widely discussed CDR options such as afforestation, ocean iron fertilization and 
surface ocean alkalinisation are individually expected to be relatively ineffective, with limited (8%) warming 
reductions relative to the scenario with no CDR option (Keller et al., 2014). Hence, the potential role that 
CDR will play in lowering the temperature in high-emission scenarios is limited (medium confidence). The 
challenges involved in comparing the climatic effects of various CDR options has also been recognized in 
recent studies (Sonntag, 2018; Mengis et al., 2019). For instance, due to compensating processes such as 
biogeophysical effects of afforestation (warming from albedo decrease when croplands are converted to 
forests) more carbon is expected to be removed from the atmosphere by afforestation than by ocean 
alkalinisation to reach the same global mean cooling.  
 
<figref>4.37</figref> 
 
The climate response to CDR-caused net negative CO2 emissions has been studied in Earth system models 
by prescribing idealized ramp-down of CO2 concentrations (Zickfeld et al., 2016)  (MacDougall, 2013a) 
(Schwinger and Tjiputra, 2018), CO2 concentrations of RCP scenarios that have net negative CO2 emissions 
(Jones et al., 2016c), and idealized net negative CO2 emission scenarios (Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015). The 
Carbon Dioxide Removal Model Intercomparison Project (CDRMIP) uses multiple ESMs to explore the 
climate response, effectiveness of CO2 removal, and challenges of CDR options (Keller et al., 2018). 
Idealized CDRMIP simulations increase CO2 concentrations at 1% per year from the level in the pre-
industrial control run (piControl) to 4 • CO2 and subsequently decrease at the same rate to the piControl 
level. This section assesses the lag in climate response to CDR-caused negative emission; climate 
‘reversibility’ is assessed in Section 4.7.2. The ramp-down phase, though unrealistic, represents the ‘net 
negative CO2 emission’ phase.  

Figure 4.37: illustrates the first results from CDRMIP (Keller et al., 2018). Other studies that use similar 
(Zickfeld et al., 2016) (Schwinger and Tjiputra, 2018)(Jeltsch-Thömmes et al., 2020) or other idealized 
scenarios (MacDougall, 2013a) or more realistic net negative CO2 emission scenarios such as RCP2.6 (Jones 
et al., 2016c) and scenarios that limit warming to 2°C or less after different levels of overshoot (Tokarska 
and Zickfeld, 2015) arrive at similar conclusions. Changes in key climate variables substantially lag behind 
the decline in CO2 (Figure 4.37). The precipitation increase at the beginning of the ramp-down phase agrees 
with the increase in precipitation for an abrupt decline in CO2 (Cao et al., 2011b). Notwithstanding a decline 
in atmospheric CO2, global mean thermosteric sea level would continue to rise. When atmospheric CO2 
returns to the piControl level, global mean thermosteric sea level is higher than its value at peak CO2 (Figure 
4.37), and it is likely that thermosteric global sea level would not return to  piControl levels for over 1000 
years after atmospheric CO2 is restored to piControl concentrations (Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; Ehlert and 
Zickfeld, 2018). Therefore, there is high confidence that sea-level rise will not be reversed by CDR at least 
for several centuries (see also Chapter 9, Section 9.6.3.5). A comparison of different models shows recovery 
of AMOC intensity during net negative CO2 emissions, but the results are model dependent  – strengthening 
with an overshoot in most models (Jackson et al., 2014;) and strengthening but not reaching the initial state 
in some models (Sgubin et al., 2015). The overall lag in response is qualitatively similar to the lagged 
climate system response in the overshoot scenario SSP5-34-OS where CO2 rises until 2062 and decreases 
thereafter (Figure 4.34) The lag in climate response to CDR causes hysteresis between key climate variables 
such as temperature, precipitation, AMOC and sea level, and atmosphere CO2 with the hysteresis 
characteristics dependent on the rate of CDR and climate sensitivity (MacDougall, 2013b) (Jeltsch-Thömmes 
et al., 2020). 
 
Termination of CDR refers to a sudden and sustained discontinuation of CDR deployment (see Section 
4.6.3.3 for termination effects of SRM). The literature on the termination effects of CDR is limited, mostly 
considering scenarios where CDR implementation is explicit and does not result in net negative CO2 
emissions (Keller et al., 2014; González et al., 2018). In simulations where CDR is applied on the RCP8.5 
scenario at scales as large as currently deemed possible, the increase in global mean warming rates following 
CDR termination are relatively small in comparison to SRM termination (Keller et al., 2014). The exception 
is artificial ocean upwelling where surface cooling is mainly caused by bringing cold water from the deep 
ocean; upon termination this causes larger rates of surface warming (Oschlies et al., 2010). When 
background emissions are as high as in RCP8.5, termination of a large global-scale application of CDR such 
as ocean alkalinisation for multiple decades could also result in large regional warming rates (up to 0.15°C 
per year) that are comparable to those caused by termination of SRM (González et al. 2018). In such cases, 
large amounts of CO2 would be removed from the atmosphere before termination, and termination would 
cause a temporal trajectory of atmospheric CO2 that is parallel to the high-emission scenario but from an 
atmosphere with much lower CO2 levels. Because CO2 radiative forcing is a logarithmic function of CO2 
concentration, large regional warming rates are simulated in such terminations. Thus, there is high 
confidence that the climate effect of CDR termination would depend on the amount CO2 removed by CDR 
prior to termination and the rate of background CO2 emissions at the time of termination. See also Chapter 5, 
Table 5.9 that summarizes the termination effects of individual CDR options.   
 
In summary, there is high confidence that, due to the near-linear relationship between cumulative carbon 
emissions and GSAT change, cooling or avoided warming due to a CDR option would depend on the 
cumulative amount of CO2 removed by that CDR option. The climate system response to the deployment of 
CDR is expected to be delayed by years (e.g., in temperature, precipitation, sea-ice extent) to centuries (e.g., 
sea level and AMOC) (high confidence). The climate response to a sudden and sustained CDR termination 
would depend on the amount of CDR-induced cooling prior to termination and the rate of background CO2 
emissions at the time of termination (high confidence). 
 
 
### 4.6.3.3  Climate Response to Solar Radiation Modification 
 
Most SRM approaches, including stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), marine cloud brightening (MCB), 
and surface albedo enhancements (Table 4.7), aim to cool the Earth by deflecting more solar radiation to 
space. Although cirrus cloud thinning (CCT) aims to cool the planet by increasing the longwave emission to 
space, it is included in the portfolio of SRM options (Table 4.7) for consistency with AR5 (Boucher et al., 
2013) and SR1.5 (de Coninck et al., 2018). Other approaches such as injection of sulphate aerosols into the 
Arctic troposphere and sea-ice albedo enhancements for moderating regional warming have also been 
suggested (MacCracken, 2016) (Field et al., 2018). As noted in SR1.5 (de Coninck et al., 2018), SRM is only 
considered as a potential supplement to deep mitigation, for example in overshoot scenarios (MacMartin et 
al., 2018). 
 
<tableref>4.7</tableref> 
 
AR5 assessed the climate response to, as well as  risks and side effects of, several SRM options (Boucher et 
al., 2013) and concluded with high confidennce that SRM, if practicable, could substantially offset a global 
temperature rise and partially offset some other impacts of global warming, but the compensation for the 
climate change caused by GHGs would be imprecise. AR5 furthermore concluded that models consistently 
suggest that SRM would generally reduce climate differences compared to a world with elevated GHG 
concentrations and no SRM; however, there would also be residual regional differences in climate (e.g., tem-
perature and rainfall) when compared to a climate without elevated GHGs. AR5 concluded with high 
confidence that scaling SRM to substantial levels would carry the risk that if the SRM were terminated for 
any reason, surface temperatures would increase rapidly (within a decade or two) to values consistent with 
the GHG forcing (Boucher et al., 2013).   
 
SR1.5 (de Coninck et al., 2018) assessed SRM in terms of its potential to limit warming to below 1.5°C in 
temporary overshoot scenarios and the associated impacts. It concluded that SAI could limit warming to 
below 1.5°C but that the climate response to SAI is uncertain and varies across climate models. Overall, the 
assessment concluded that the combined uncertainties related to SRM approaches, including technological 
maturity, limited physical understanding of the response to SRM, potential impacts, and challenges of 
governance, constrain potential deployment of SRM in the near future. 
 
This subsection assesses the global and large-scale physical climate system response to SRM based on 
theoretical and modelling studies. There is no mature technology today to implement any of the SRM 
options assessed here. A short summary of the SRM options, including the proposed mechanism of each 
SRM approach, radiative forcing potential, and key climate and environmental effects, is listed in Table 4.7 
Chapter 5 (Section 5.6.3) assesses the biogeochemical implications of SRM, Chapter 6 (Section 6.3.6) 
assesses the potential ERF of the aerosol-based SRM options and Chapter 8 (Section 8.6.3) assesses the 
abrupt water cycle changes in response to initiation or termination of SRM. The risks to human and natural 
systems, impacts of SRM, ethics, and perceptions are assessed in the WGII report (Chapter 16). Governance 
issues associated with SRM research and deployment are assessed in the WGII and WGIII Reports. The 
assessment of technical feasibility and engineering aspects of SRM is beyond the scope of this report.  
 
The AR5 assessed SRM modelling mainly based on idealized simulations that used solar constant 
reductions. Since then, more in-depth investigations into specific SRM approaches have been conducted with 
more sophisticated treatment of aerosol–cloud–radiative interactions and stratospheric dynamics and 
chemistry underlying SAI, MCB, and CCT. Another major development since AR5 is the investigation into 
whether multiple climate policy goals may be met by optimally designed SRM strategies, including large-
ensemble SAI simulations using multiple injection locations. There are large uncertainties in important 
SRM-related processes such as aerosol microphysics and aerosol-cloud-radiation interaction and hence the 
level of understanding is low. 
 
As assessed in SR1.5 (de Coninck et al., 2018), most of the knowledge about SRM is based on idealized 
model simulations and some natural analogues. In addition to single-model studies, more results from the 
coordinated modelling work of Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP) have become 
available. GeoMIP was initiated  at the time of AR5 (Kravitz et al., 2011) (Kravitz et al., 2013a) and is now 
in its second phase under the framework of CMIP6 (GEOMIP6, Kravitz et al., 2015). However, studies 
based on GeoMIP6 data are currently limited and hence the assessment on climate response to SRM here is 
derived mostly from GeoMIP literature together with studies with single models.  
 
Simple calculations and climate modelling studies show that about 2% extra solar irradiance reflected away 
from Earth or a 1 percentage point increase in planetary albedo (0.31 to 0.32) would suffice to offset global 
mean warming from a doubling of the CO2 concentration (The Royal Society, 2009)(Kravitz et al., 2013a) 
(Kravitz et al., 2021). To offset the same amount of CO2-induced GSAT increase, different levels of ERF are 
required for different methods of SRM (Schmidt et al., 2012; Russotto and Ackerman, 2018)(Modak et al., 
2016)(Chiodo and Polvani, 2016)(Duan et al., 2018) (Krishnamohan et al., 2019)(Zhao et al., 2020). 
 
As assessed in AR5 (Boucher et al., 2013), abruptly introducing SRM to fully offset global warming reduces 
temperature toward 1850–1900 values with an e-folding time of only about 5 years (Matthews and Caldeira, 
2007). A more realistic approach would be a slow ramp-up of SRM to offset further warming (MacCracken, 
2016) (Tilmes et al., 2016). Modelling studies have consistently shown that SRM has the potential to offset 
some effects of increasing GHGs on global and regional climate, including the melting of Arctic sea ice  
(Moore et al., 2014) (Berdahl et al., 2014) and mountain glaciers (Zhao et al., 2017), weakening of Atlantic 
meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) (Cao et al., 2016; Hong et al., 2017) (Tilmes et al., 2020), 
changes in extremes of temperature and precipitation  (Curry et al., 2014) (Ji et al., 2018)(Muthyala et al., 
2018), and changes in frequency and intensity of tropical cyclone (Moore et al., 2015) (Jones et al., 2017).  
 
The climate response to SRM depends greatly on the characteristics of SRM implementation approaches. 
There could be substantial residual or overcompensating climate change at both the global and regional 
scales and seasonal timescales (Irvine et al., 2016) (Kravitz et al., 2014) (Fasullo et al., 2018) (McCusker et 
al., 2015) (Gertler et al., 2020) (Jiang et al., 2019). This is because the climate response to SRM options is 
different from the response to GHG increase (Figure 4.38). For instance, when global mean warming is 
offset by a uniform reduction in incoming sunlight, there is residual warming in the high latitudes and 
overcooling in the tropics (Kravitz et al., 2013a; Kalidindi et al., 2015), and a reduction in tropical mean 
rainfall (Tilmes et al., 2013). In simulations of stratospheric SO2 injection, SRM diminishes the amplitude of 
the seasonal cycle of temperature at many high‐latitude locations, with warmer winters and cooler summers 
(Jiang et al., 2019). Further, the rates of response could differ between surface temperature and slow 
components in the climate system such as sea-level rise (Irvine et al., 2012; Jones et al., 2018). SRM 
implemented at a moderate intensity, for example by offsetting half of the global warming, has the potential 
to reduce negative effects such as reduced precipitation that are associated with fully offsetting global mean 
warming (Irvine et al., 2019) (Irvine and Keith, 2020).  
 
For the same amount of global mean cooling achieved, the pattern of climate response would depend on 
SRM characteristics (Niemeier et al., 2013)(Muri et al., 2018)(Duan et al., 2018). This is illustrated in Figure 
4.38 for temperature and precipitation change relative to a high-CO2 world for scenarios of CO2 reduction, 
solar irradiance reduction, SAI, and MCB. The pattern differences for different methods are much larger for 
precipitation than for temperature. The pattern of climate change resulting from SRM is also different from 
that resulting from CO2 reduction (Figure 4.38). It is virtually certain that SRM approaches would not be 
able to precisely offset the GHG-induced anthropogenic climate change at global and regional scales.  
 
Because of different sensitivity of precipitation change to CO2 and solar forcings (Myhre et al., 2017), if 
shortwave-based SRM is used to fully offset GHG-induced global mean warming, there would be a 
overcompensation of GHG-induced increase in global mean precipitation (Kravitz et al., 2013a; Tilmes et 
al., 2013; Irvine et al., 2016). Further, regional SRM approaches such as aerosol injections into the Arctic 
stratosphere are likely to remotely influence on tropical monsoon precipitation by shifting the mean position 
of ITCZ (Nalam et al., 2018). However, the shift could be avoided by simultaneously cooling the southern 
hemisphere (MacCracken et al., 2013; Kravitz et al., 2016; Nalam et al., 2018). The SRM response of 
precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P–E) is found to be smaller than that of precipitation because of 
reduction in both precipitation and evapotranspiration (Tilmes et al., 2013; Nalam et al., 2018; Irvine et al., 
2019). Thus, global mean soil moisture could be effectively maintained, though with significant regional 
variability (Cheng et al., 2019).   
 
The Geoengineering Large Ensemble Project (GLENS) has investigated achieving multiple climate policy 
goals by adjusting the rate of stratospheric SO2 injection at four different latitudes. GSAT, the inter-
hemispheric temperature difference, and the equator-to-pole temperature gradient could be maintained 
simultaneously at the year-2020 level under RCP 8.5 (Tilmes et al., 2018a). The possibility of using SAI to 
simultaneously stabilize non-temperature metrics such as tropical precipitation and Arctic sea-ice extent is 
also explored (Lee et al., 2020). Furthermore, the potential  of achieving multiple climate policy goals by 
combining two SRM approaches is also examined in a few modelling studies, with low confidence in the 
outcome of combining various approaches and the related climate response (Boucher et al., 2017; Cao et al., 
2017).

#### Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) 
Most research has focused on SIA, the injection of sulphate particles or its precursor gases such as SO2, 
which would then be oxidized to H2SO4.  Injection of other types of aerosol particles, such as calcite 
(CaCO3), titanium dioxide (TiO2), aluminium oxide (Al2O3), and engineered nanoparticles has also been 
proposed (Keith, 2010)(Ferraro et al., 2011)(Pope et al., 2012)(Keith et al., 2016)(Jones et al., 
2016a)(Weisenstein et al., 2015), but are much less studied compared to sulphate injection. The natural 
analogue for sulphate aerosol injection is major volcanic eruptions (see Cross-Chapter Box 4.1), While 
volcanic eruptions are not perfect analogues for SAI (Robock et al., 2013; Plazzotta et al., 2018a; Duan et al., 
2019), studies on climate impacts of past volcanic eruptions can inform on the potential impact of 
stratospheric sulphate injection. For example, emergent constraints (see Chapter 1 and 5) that relate the 
climate system response to volcanic eruptions can be used to reduce uncertainty of the land surface 
temperature response to SAI (Plazzotta et al., 2018b).  
 
The cooling potential of SAI using sulphate aerosols depends on many factors (Visioni et al., 2017) 
including the amount of injection (Niemeier and Timmreck, 2015), aerosol microphysics (Krishnamohan et 
al., 2020), the spatial and temporal pattern of injection (Tilmes et al., 2017), response of stratospheric 
dynamics and chemistry (Richter Jadwiga et al., 2018), and aerosol effect on cirrus clouds (Visioni et al., 
2018). A negative radiative forcing of a few W m-2 (ranging from 1 to 8 W m-2) could be achieved depending 
on the amount and location of SO2 injected into the stratosphere (Pitari et al., 2014)(Aquila et al., 
2014)(Niemeier and Timmreck, 2015)(Kleinschmitt et al., 2018a)(Kleinschmitt et al., 2018a)(Kravitz et al., 
2017)(Tilmes et al., 2018a). The simulated efficacy of SAI by emission of SO2 (radiative forcing per mass of 
injection rate) generally decreases with the increase in injection rate because of the growth of larger particles 
(about 0.5 microns) through condensation and coagulation reducing the mass scattering efficiency (Niemeier 
and Timmreck, 2015; Kleinschmitt et al., 2018b). However, efficacy changes little for total injection rate up 
to about 25 Tg Syr-1 when SO2 is injected at multiple locations simultaneously (Kravitz et al., 2017)(Tilmes 
et al., 2018a). Differences in model representation of aerosol microphysics, evolution of particle size, 
stratospheric dynamics and chemistry, and aerosol microphysics-radiation-circulation interactions all 
contribute to the uncertainty in simulated cooling efficiency of SAI. Compared to sulphate aerosols, injection 
of non-sulphate particles would result in different cooling efficacy, but understanding is limited (Weisenstein 
et al., 2015)(Pope et al., 2012)(Jones et al., 2016a). 
 
Earlier modelling studies focused on the effect of equatorial sulphate injection that tends to overcool the 
tropics and undercool the poles. Compared to equatorial injection, off-equatorial injection at multiple 
locations shows a closer resemblance to the baseline climate in many aspects, including temperature, 
precipitation, and sea ice coverage (Kravitz et al., 2019). However, significant regional and seasonal residual  
and overcompensating climate change is reported, including regional shifts in precipitation, continued 
warming of polar oceans, and shifts in the seasonal cycle of snow depth and sea ice cover (Simpson et al., 
2019a)(Fasullo et al., 2018)(Jiang et al., 2019). By appropriately adjusting the amount, latitude, altitude, and 
timing of the aerosol injection, modelling studies suggest that SAI is conceptually able to achieve some 
desired combination of radiative forcing and climate response (medium confidence) (Dai et al., 
2018)(MacMartin et al., 2017)(Visioni et al., 2020b)(Lee et al., 2020). 
 
There is large uncertainty in the stratospheric response to SAI, and the change in stratospheric dynamics and 
chemistry would depend on the amount, size, type, location, and timing of injection. There is high 
confidence that aerosol-induced stratospheric heating will play an important role in surface climate change 
(Simpson et al., 2019a) by altering the effective radiative forcing (Krishnamohan et al., 2019), lower 
stratosphere stability (Ferraro and Griffiths, 2016), quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) (Aquila et al., 2014) 
(Niemeier and Schmidt, 2017)(Kleinschmitt et al., 2018a), polar vortexes (Visioni et al., 2020a), and North 
Atlantic Oscillation (Jones et al., 2021). Model simulations indicate stronger polar jets and weaker storm 
tracks and a poleward shift of the tropospheric mid-latitude jets in response to stratospheric sulphate 
injections in the tropics (Ferraro et al., 2015)(Richter Jadwiga et al., 2018), as the meridional temperature 
gradient is increased in the lower stratosphere by the aerosol-induced heating. The aerosol-induced warming 
would also offset some of the GHG-induced stratospheric cooling. Compared to equatorial injection, off-
equatorial injection is likely to result in reduced change in stratospheric heating, circulation, and QBO 
(Richter Jadwiga et al., 2018)(Kravitz et al., 2019). Stratospheric ozone response to sulphate injection is 
uncertain depending on the amount, altitude, and location of injection (WMO, 2018). It is likely that sulphate 
injection would cause a reduction in polar column ozone concentration and delay the recovery of Antarctic 
ozone hole (Pitari et al., 2014)(Richter Jadwiga et al., 2018)(Tilmes et al., 2018b), which would have 
implications for UV radiation and surface ozone (Pitari et al., 2014)(Richter Jadwiga et al., 2018)(Tilmes et 
al., 2018b)(Xia et al., 2017). Injection of non-sulphate aerosols is likely to result in less stratospheric heating 
and ozone loss (Keith et al., 2016)(Weisenstein et al., 2015)(Pope et al., 2012). One side effect of SAI is 
increased sulphate deposition at surface. A recent modelling study indicates that to maintain global 
temperature at 2020 levels under RCP 8.5, increased sulphate deposition from stratospheric sulphate 
injection could be globally balanced by the projected decrease in tropospheric anthropogenic SO2 emission, 
but the spatial distribution of sulphate deposition would move from low to high latitudes (Visioni et al., 
2020c).     
 
#### Marine cloud brightening (MCB) 
MCB involves injecting small aerosols such as sea salt into the base of marine stratocumulus clouds where 
the aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). In the absence of other changes, an increase in CCN 
would produce higher cloud droplet number concentration with reduced droplet sizes, increasing cloud 
albedo. Increased droplet concentration may also increase cloud water content and optical thickness, but 
recent studies suggest that liquid water path response to anthropogenic aerosols is weak due to the competing 
effects of suppressed precipitation and enhanced cloud water evaporation (Toll et al., 2019). An analogue for 
MCB are reflective, persistent ‘ship tracks’ observed after the passage of a sea-going vessel emitting 
combustion aerosols into susceptible clouds (Chen et al., 2012) (Christensen and Stephens, 2011) 
(Gryspeerdt et al., 2019). A recent study (Diamond et al., 2020) found a substantial increase in cloud 
reflectivity from shipping in southeast Atlantic basin, suggesting that a regional-scale test of MCB in 
stratocumulus‐dominated regions could be successful.   
 
Modelling studies suggest that MCB has the potential to achieve a negative forcing of about 1 to 5 W m-2, 
depending on the deployment area and strategies of cloud seeding (Partanen et al., 2012) (Stjern et al., 
2018)(Alterskjær et al., 2013) (Ahlm et al., 2017) (Hill and Ming, 2012). Regional applications of MCB has 
also been suggested for offsetting severe impacts from tropical cyclones whose genesis is associated with 
higher SST (MacCracken, 2016) (Latham et al., 2014) and for protecting coral reefs from higher SST 
(Latham et al., 2013). However, such regional approaches also involve large uncertainties in the magnitude 
of the responses and consequences. 
 
Several modelling studies suggest that the direct scattering effect by injected particles might also play an 
important role in the cooling effect of MCB, but the relative contribution of aerosol–cloud and aerosol–
cloud–radiation effect is uncertain (Partanen et al., 2012) (Ahlm et al., 2017) (Kravitz et al., 2013b). Relative 
to the high-GHG climate, it is likely that MCB would increase precipitation over tropical land due to the 
inhomogeneous forcing pattern of MCB over ocean and land (medium confidence) (Alterskjær et al., 2013) 
(Ahlm et al., 2017)(Stjern et al., 2018) (Niemeier et al., 2013) (Muri et al., 2018) (Bala et al., 2011). Because 
of the high level of uncertainty associated with cloud microphysics and aerosol–cloud–radiation interaction 
(See also Chapter 7, Section 7.3), the climate response to MCB is as uncertain. Results from global climate 
models are subject to large uncertainty because of different treatment of cloud microphysics and inadequate 
representation of sub-grid aerosol and cloud processes (Stjern et al., 2018) (Stuart et al., 2013) (Alterskjær 
and Kristjánsson, 2013) (Connolly et al., 2014). Sea salt deposition over land (Muri et al., 2015) and the 
effect of sea salt emission on atmospheric chemistry (Horowitz et al., 2020) are some of the potential side 
effects of MCB.  
 
#### Cirrus Cloud Thinning (CCT) 
Cirrus clouds trap more outgoing thermal radiation than they reflect incoming solar radiation and thus have 
an overall warming effect on the climate system (Mitchell and Finnegan, 2009).  The aim of CCT is to 
reduce cirrus cloud optical depth by increasing the heterogeneous nucleation via seeding cirrus clouds with 
an optimal concentration of ice nucleating particles,which might cause larger ice crystals and rapid fallout, 
resulting in reduced lifetime and coverage of cirrus clouds (Muri et al., 2014), (Gasparini et al., 2017; 
Lohmann and Gasparini, 2017; Gruber et al., 2019a). CCT aims to achieve the opposite effect of contrails 
that increase cirrus cover and cause a small positive ERF (Chapter 7, Section 7.3). A high-resolution 
modelling study of CCT over a limited area of the Arctic suggested that cirrus seeding causes a decrease in 
ice crystal number concentration and a reduction in mixed-phase cloud cover, both of which cause a cooling 
effect (Gruber et al., 2019b).  
 
Under present-day climate, cirrus clouds exerts a net positive radiative forcing of about 5 W m-2 (Gasparini 
and Lohmann, 2016)(Hong et al., 2016), indicating a maximum cooling potential of the same magnitude if 
all cirrus cloud were removed from the climate system. However, modelling results show a much smaller 
cooling effect of CCT. For the optimal ice nuclei seeding concentration and globally non-uniform seeding 
strategy, a net negative cloud radiative forcing of about 1 to 2 W m-2 is achieved (Storelvmo and Herger, 
2014) (Gasparini et al., 2020). A few studies find that no seeding strategy could achieve a significant cooling 
effect, owing to complex microphysical mechanisms limiting robust climate responses to cirrus seeding 
(Penner et al., 2015; Gasparini and Lohmann, 2016). A higher than optimal concentration of ice nucleating 
particles could also result in over-seeding that increases rather than decreases cirrus optical thickness 
(Storelvmo et al., 2013) (Gasparini and Lohmann, 2016). Thus, there is low confidence in the cooling effect 
of CCT, due to limited understanding of cirrus microphysics, its interaction with aerosols, and the 
complexity of seeding strategy.  
 
Relative to the high-GHG climate and for the same amount of global cooling, CCT is simulated to cause an 
increase in global precipitation compared to shortwave-based SRM options such as SAI and MCB (Muri et 
al., 2018) (Duan et al., 2018) because of the opposing effects of CCT and increased CO2 on outgoing 
longwave radiation (Kristjánsson et al., 2015) (Jackson et al., 2016). Combining SAI and CCT has suggested 
that GHG-induced changes in global mean temperature and precipitation can be simultaneously offset (Cao 
et al., 2017), but there is low confidence in the applicability of this result to the real world owing to the large 
uncertainty in simulating aerosol forcing and the complex cirrus microphysical processes. 
 
#### Surface-based albedo modification  
Surface-based albedo modification could, in principle, achieve a negative radiative forcing of a few W m-2 
by enhancing the albedo of the ocean surface (Kravitz et al., 2018)(Gabriel et al., 2017). However, the 
technology does not exist today to increase ocean albedo at large scale. An increase in crop albedo or roof 
albedo in urban areas could help to reduce warming in densely populated and important agricultural regions, 
but the effect would be limited to local scales and ineffective at counteracting global warming (Crook et al., 
2015a) (Zhang et al., 2016). Large changes in desert albedo could in principle result in substantial global 
cooling, but would severely alter the hydrological cycle (Crook et al., 2015a). 
 
In addition to above-mentioned SRM methods, a number of local intervention methods have been proposed 
to limit the loss of cryosphere, such as applying reflective materials over sea ice (Field et al., 2018), pumping 
seawater on top of the ice surface  (Desch et al., 2017) (Zampieri and Goessling, 2019), depositing massive 
amount of snow over ice sheets (Feldmann et al., 2019), and blocking warm seawater from reaching glaciers 
(Moore et al., 2018a). The stabilization of ice sheets through local intervention methods would reduce sea 
level commitment (Section 9.6.3.5). However, these methods are subject to large uncertainty concerning 
their feasibility and effectiveness, and their effects would be largely localized.  
 
#### Detectability of climate response to SRM 
Internal variability could mask the response to SRM-related forcing in the near term (see also Section 
4.6.3.1). A detection of the global scale climate system response to stratospheric sulphate aerosol injection 
will likely require a forcing of the size produced by the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption (Robock et al., 2010). 
In model simulations of where 5 Tg SO2 is injected into the stratosphere continuously (roughly one fourth of 
the 1991 Pinatubo eruption per year) under RCP 4.5, it is shown that, relative to the high-GHG world 
without SRM, the effect of SRM on global temperature and precipitation is detectable after one to two 
decades (Bürger and Cubasch, 2015; Lo et al., 2016) which is similar to the timescale for the emergence of 
GSAT trends due to strong mitigation (Section 4.6.3.1). The detection time is sensitive to detection methods 
and filtering techniques (Lo et al. 2016). An analysis using GLENS simulation (MacMartin et al., 2019) 
compares response in temperature, precipitation, and precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P-E) between a 
climate state with GHG-induced 1.5° C global mean temperature change and that with the same global mean 
temperature but under RCP4.5 emissions and a limited deployment of SO2 injection. It is found that at grid-
scale, difference in climate response between these two climate states are not detectable by the end of this 
century. However, for higher emission scenarios of the RCP8.5 and correspondingly larger SRM deployment 
for maintaining the same global mean temperature change of 1.5°C, the regional differences are detectable 
before the end of the century. In addition to surface temperature and precipitation, observations of aerosol 
burden and temperature in the stratosphere via the deployment of stratospheric aerosol observing system 
might facilitate the detection of climate response to SAI. 
 
#### Climate response to termination of SRM 
A hypothetical, sudden and sustained termination of SRM in a world with high GHG concentrations has 
been simulated to cause climate rebound effects such as rapid increase in global temperature, precipitation, 
and sea level, and rapid reduction in sea-ice area (Crook et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2013; McCusker et al., 
2014; Muri et al., 2018). Model simulations also show reduced precipitation over land areas in the first few 
years following termination, indicating general drying that would exacerbate the effects of rapid warming 
(McCusker et al., 2014). A sudden and sustained termination of SRM is also expected to weaken carbon 
sinks, accelerating atmospheric CO2 accumulation and warming (Tjiputra et al., 2016) (Muri et al., 2018) 
(Plazzotta et al., 2019). A gradual phase-out of SRM combined with mitigation and CDR could reduce the 
large warming rates from sudden SRM termination (MacMartin et al., 2014) (Keith and MacMartin, 2015; 
Tilmes et al., 2016), though this would be limited by how rapidly emission reductions can be scaled up 
(Ekholm and Korhonen, 2016).  
 
#### Synthesis of the climate response to SRM 
Modelling studies have consistently shown that SRM has the potential to offset some effect of increasing 
GHGs on global and regional climate (high confidence), but there would be substantial residual or 
overcompensating climate change at the regional scale and seasonal timescale (high confidence). Large 
uncertainties associated with aerosol–cloud–radiation interactions persist in our understanding of climate 
response to aerosol-based SRM options. For the same amount of global mean cooling, different SRM options 
would cause different patterns of climate change (medium confidence). Modelling studies suggest that it is 
conceptually possible to achieve multiple climate policy goals by optimally designed SRM strategies.  

The effect of SRM options on global temperature and precipitation response would detectable after one or 
two decades, which is similar to the timescale for the detection of strong mitigation. There is high confidence 
that a sudden and sustained termination of a high level of SRM against a high-GHG background would cause 
a rapid increase in temperature at a rate that far exceeds that projected for climate change without SRM. 
However, a gradual phase-out of SRM combined with mitigation and CDR would more likely than not avoid 
large rates of warming.  
 

# 4.7  Climate Change Beyond 2100 
 
This section assesses changes in climate beyond 2100. An advance since AR5 is the availability of ESM 
results for scenarios beyond 2100 and for much longer stabilisation simulations compared with analysis 
predominantly based on Earth system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs) at the time of AR5 (e.g. 
Eby et al., 2013; Zickfeld et al., 2013). Long-term commitment of sea-level rise due to thermal expansion 
and ice-sheet loss is assessed in Chapter 9 (9.6.3.5; figure 9.0). Here we assess projections of GSAT, global 
precipitation, and Arctic sea ice. Uncertainties relating to potential long-term changes in AMOC are treated 
in 9.2.3.1. 
 
On multi-century timescales it is common to explore changes that are due to long-term commitment.Here we 
differentiate between: 

- *Committed emissions due to infrastructure.* Infrastructure that causes greenhouse gas emissions 
cannot be changed straight away leading to a commitment from existing infrastructure that some 
emissions will continue for a number of years into the future (Davis and Socolow, 2014; Smith et al., 
2019a). Further consideration of this aspect of commitment will be assessed by WGIII. 
- *Climate response to constant emissions.* Some of the scenario extensions beyond 2100 make 
assumptions about constant emissions (either positive or negative). Section 4.7.1 will assess changes 
in climate under scenario extensions beyond 2100. 
- *Committed climate change to constant atmospheric composition.* There is widespread literature on 
how the climate continues to change after stabilisation of radiative forcing. This includes diagnosing 
the long-term climate response to a doubling of CO2 (ECS, Chapter 7). Since AR5, more GCMs 
have run stabilised forcing simulations for many centuries allowing new insights into their very 
long-term behaviour (Section 7.4.3).  
- *Committed response to zero emissions.* How climate would continue to evolve if all emissions 
ceased. SR1.5 assessed changes in climate if emissions of all greenhouse gases and aerosols ceased. 
Section 4.7.2 assesses new results considering cessation of CO2-only emissions which forms a 
significant term in calculating remaining carbon budgets. 
- *Irreversibility.* Some changes do not revert if the forcing is removed, leaving a committed change to 
the system. Section 4.7.2 assesses changes in the Earth system which may be irreversible. 
- *Abrupt changes.* If a tipping point in the climate system is passed, then some elements may continue 
to respond if the forcing which caused them is removed. Section 4.7.2 assesses the potential for 
abrupt changes in the Earth system. 


## 4.7.1  Commitment and Climate Change Beyond 2100  
 
### 4.7.1.1  Climate change following zero emissions 
 
The zero emissions commitment (ZEC) is the the climate change commitment that would result, in terms of 
projected GSAT, from setting carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to zero. It is determined by both inertia in 
physical climate system components (ocean, cryosphere, land surface) and carbon cycle inertia (see Annex 
VII). In its widest sense it refers to emissions of all compounds including greenhouses gases, aerosols and 
their pre-cursors. A specific sub-category of zero emissions commitment is the zero CO2 emissions 
commitment, which refers to the climate system response to a cessation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions 
excluding the impact of non-CO2 forcers. Assessment of remaining carbon budgets requires an assessment of 
zero CO2 emissions commitment as well as of the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions 
(TCRE, Chapter 5 Section 5.5.2). 
 
There is an offset of continued warming following cessation of emissions by continued CO2 removal by 
natural sinks (e.g. Joos et al., 2013; Matthews and Caldeira, 2008; Solomon et al., 2009; Ricke and Caldeira, 
2014) (high confidence). Some models continue warming by up to 0.5°C after emissions cease at 2°C of 
warming (Frölicher & Paynter, 2015; Frölicher et al., 2014; Williams et al., 2017), while others simulate 
little to no additional warming (Nohara et al., 2015). In SR1.5, the available evidence indicated that past CO2 
emissions do not commit to substantial further warming (Allen et al., 2018). A ZEC close to zero was thus 
applied for the computation of the remaining carbon budget for the (Rogelj et al., 2018b). However, the 
available literature consisted of simulations from a small number of models using a variety of experimental 
designs, with some simulations showing a complex evolution of temperature following cessation of 
emissions (e.g., Frölicher & Paynter, 2015; Frölicher et al., 2014). 
 
Here we draw on new simulations to provide an assessment of ZEC using multiple ESMs (Jones et al., 
2019b) and EMICs (MacDougall et al., 2020). Figure 4.39 shows results from 20 models that simulate the 
evolution of CO2 and the GSAT response following cessation of CO2 emissions for an experiment where 
1000 PgC is emitted during a 1% per year CO2 increase. All simulations show a strong reduction in 
atmospheric CO2 concentration following cessation of CO2 emissions in agreement with previous studies and 
basic theory that natural carbon sinks will persist. Therefore, there is very high confidence that atmospheric 
CO2 concentrations would decline for decades if CO2 emissions cease. Temperature evolution in the 100 
years following cessation of emissions varies by model and across timescales, with some models showing 
declining temperature, others having ZEC close to zero, and others showing continued warming following 
cessation of emissions (Figure 4.39). The GSAT response depends on the balance of carbon sinks and ocean 
heat uptake (MacDougall et al., 2020). The 20-year average GSAT change 50 years after the cessation of 
emissions (ZEC50) is summarised in Table 4.8. The mean value of ZEC50 is –0.079°C, with 5–95% range –
0.34 to 0.28 °C. There is no strong relationship between ZEC50 and modelled climate sensitivity (neither 
ECS nor TCR; MacDougall et al., 2020). It is therefore likely that the absolute magnitude of ZEC50 is less 
than 0.3 °C, but we assess low confidence in the sign of ZEC on 50-year timescales. This is small compared 
with natural variability in GSAT.

### 4.7.1.2  Change in Global Climate Indices Beyond 2100 
 
This subsection assesses changes in global climate indices out to 2300 using extensions of the SSP scenarios 
(Meinshausen et al., 2020) and literature based on extensions to the RCP scenarios from CMIP5 
(Meinshausen et al., 2011), which differ from the SSPs despite similar labelling of global radiative forcing 
levels (Section 4.6.2). Meinshausen et al. (2020) describe the extensions to the SSP scenarios, which differ 
slightly from the ScenarioMIP documentation (O’Neill et al., 2016). A simplified approach across scenarios 
reduces emissions such that after 2100, land use CO2 emissions are reduced to zero by 2150; any net 
negative fossil CO2 emissions are reduced to zero by 2200, and positive fossil CO2 emissions are reduced to 
zero by 2250. Non-CO2 fossil fuel emissions are also reduced to zero by 2250 while land-use-related non-
CO2 emissions are held constant at 2100 levels. The extensions are created up to the year 2500, but ESM 
simulations have only been requested, as part of the CMIP6 protocol, to run to 2300. As a result, unlike the 
RCP8.5 extension, SSP5-8.5 sees a decline in CO2 concentration after 2250, but the radiative forcing level is 
similar, reaching approximately 12 Wm-2 during most of the extension. Both SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-3.4-OS 
decrease radiative forcing after 2100. SSP5-3.4-OS is designed to return to the same level of forcing as 
SSP1-2.6 during the first half of the 22nd century. Because relatively few CMIP6 ESMs have submitted 
results beyond 2100, GSAT projections using the MAGICC7 emulator (see Cross-Chapter Box 7.1) are also 
shown here. 
  
Changes in climate at 2300 have impacts and commitments beyond this timeframe (high confidence). Sea-
level rise may exceed 2 m on millennial timescales even when warming is limited to 1.5–2°C, and tens of 
meters for higher warming levels (Chapter 9, Section 9.6.3.5, Table 9.10). Randerson et al. (2015) showed 
increasing importance on carbon cycle feedbacks of slow ocean processes, Mahowald et al. (2017) showed 
the long-lasting legacy of land-use effects and Moore et al., (2018) show how changes in Southern Ocean 
winds affect nutrients and marine productivity well beyond 2300. Clark et al. (2016) show that physical and 
biogeochemical impacts of 21st century emissions have a potential committed legacy of at least 10,000 
years.

#### 4.7.1.2.1  Global Surface Air Temperature  
Both CMIP6 and CMIP5 results show that global temperature beyond 2100 is strongly dependent on 
scenario, and the difference in GSAT projections between high- and low-emission scenarios continues to 
increase (high confidence). Under the extended RCP2.6 (Caesar et al., 2013) and SSP1-2.6 scenarios, where 
CO2 concentration and radiative forcing continue to decline beyond 2100, GSAT stabilises during the 21st 
century before decreasing and remaining below 2°C until 2300 except in some of the very high climate-
sensitivity ESMs, which project GSAT to stay above 2°C by 2300 (Figure 4.40). Under RCP8.5, regional 
temperature changes above 20°C have been reported in multiple models over high-latitude land areas (Caesar 
et al., 2013; Randerson et al., 2015b). Non-CO2 forcing and feedbacks remain important by 2300 (high 
confidence). Randerson et al. (2015) found that 1.6°C of warming by 2300 came from non-CO2 forcing alone 
in RCP8.5, and Rind et al. (2018) show that regional forcing from aerosols can have notable effects on ocean 
circulation on centennial timescales. High latitude warming led to longer growing seasons and increased 
vegetation growth in the CESM1 model (Liptak et al., 2017), and Burke et al. (2017) found that carbon 
release from permafrost areas susceptible to this warming may amplify future climate change by up to 17% 
by 2300.  
 
Too few CMIP6 models performed the extension simulations to allow a robust assessment of GSAT 
projection, and some of those which did had higher than average climate sensitivity values. Therefore, we 
base our assessment of GSAT projections (Table 4.9) on the MAGICC7 emulator calibrated against assessed 
GSAT to 2100 (Section 4.3.4, Cross-Chapter Box 7.1). Because the emulator approach has not been 
evaluated in depth up to 2300 in the same way as it has up to 2100 (Cross-Chapter Box 7.1) we account for 
possible additional uncertainty by assessing the 5–95% range from MAGICC as likely instead of very likely. 
It is therefore likely that GSAT will exceed 2°C above that of the period 1850–1900 at the year 2300 in the 
extended SSP scenarios SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 (Figure 4.40). For SSP1-2.6 and SSP1-1.9, mean 
warming at 2300 is 1.5°C and 0.9°C respectively. GSAT differences between SSP5-3.4-overshoot and SSP1-
2.6 peak during the 21st century but decline to less than about 0.25°C after 2150 (medium confidence). 
 
To place the temperature projections for the end of the 23rd century into the context of paleo temperatures, 
GSAT under SSP2-4.5 (2.3°C–4.6°C) has not been experienced since the Mid Pliocene, about 3 million 
years ago. GSAT projected for the end of the 23rd century under SSP5-8.5 (6.6°C–14.1°C) overlaps with the 
range estimated for the Miocene Climatic Optimum (5-10°C) and Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (10°C–
18°C), about 15 and 50 million years ago, respectively (medium confidence; Chapter 2). 
 
<tableref>4.9</tableref> 
 
#### 4.7.1.2.2  Global Land Precipitation 
Global land precipitation will continue to increase in line with GSAT under high emission scenarios 
(medium confidence). Precipitation changes over land show larger variability and a less clear signal than 
global total precipitation. Caesar et al. (2013) showed that under the CMIP5 extension simulations, 
HadGEM2-ES projected global land precipitation to remain roughly the same in RCP2.6, to increase by 
about 4% in RCP4.5 and to increase by about 7% in RCP8.5. Their results showed global precipitation 
increasing linearly with temperature while radiative forcing increases, but then more quickly if forcing is 
stabilised or reduced. This backs up findings of an intensification of the hydrological cycle following CO2 
decrease which has been attributed to a build-up of ocean heat (Wu et al., 2010), and to a fast atmospheric 
adjustment to CO2 radiative forcing (Cao et al., 2011a). Figure 4.40 shows that global land precipitation 
increases in CMIP6 models until 2300 for SSP5-8.5 but stabilises in SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-3.4-OS. SSP1-2.6 
and SSP5-3.4-OS are not distinguishable in behaviour of projected global land precipitation after 2100. 
 
 
#### 4.7.1.2.3  Arctic Sea Ice 
Chapter 9 assesses with high confidence that on decadal and longer timescales, Arctic summer sea-ice area 
will remain highly correlated with global mean temperature until the summer sea ice has vanished (Section 
9.3.1.1). This means that Arctic sea ice will continue to decline in scenarios of continued warming but will 
begin to recover in scenarios where GSAT begins to decrease. Under the CMIP5 extension simulations, 
minimum (September) Arctic sea-ice area began to recover for most models under RCP2.6 out to 2300, 
while RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 extensions became ice-free in September (Hezel et al., 2014; Bathiany et al., 
2016). They also found increasingly strong winter responses under continued warming such that under the 
RCP8.5 extension, the Arctic became ice-free nearly year-round by 2300. Consistent with the assessment in 
Section 9.3.1.1 that Arctic sea-ice area is correlated with GSAT, CMIP6 projections to 2300 show partial sea 
ice recovery by 2300 in SSP1-2.6 in line with GSAT (Figure 4.40), with one model (MRI-ESM2-0) showing 
near complete recovery to present-day values. SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-3.4-OS are not distinguishable in 
behaviour of Arctic sea-ice in these models after 2100. SSP5-8.5 remains ice-free in September up to 2300.  
 
 
## 4.7.2  Potential for Abrupt and Irreversible Climate Change  
 
Similar to AR5 and SROCC, AR6 defines an abrupt climate change as a large-scale abrupt change in 
the climate system that takes place over a few decades or less, persists (or is anticipated to persist) for at least 
a few decades and causes substantial impacts in human and/or natural systems (Annex VII: Glossary). 
Further, AR6 considers such a perturbed state of a dynamical system as irreversible on a given timescale, if 
the recovery timescale from this state due to natural processes takes substantially longer than the timescale of 
interest (Annex VII: Glossary). The AR6 adopts the related definition of a tipping point as a critical 
threshold beyond which a system reorganizes, often abruptly and/or irreversibly, and a tipping element as a 
component of the Earth system that is susceptible to a tipping point (Annex VII: Glossary). Tipping points 
may involve global or regional climate changes from one stable state to another stable state or to changes 
that occur faster than the rate of change of forcing (Alley et al., 2003) and include shifts from one 
equilibrium state to another and other responses of the climate system to external forcing (see Section 1.2.4.2 
in Chapter 1). While reversibility has been defined alternatively in the literature with respect to the response 
specifically to idealized CO2 forcing and generally GSAT change, AR6 considers both definitions 
synonymous, because it has been widely demonstrated that the GSAT change is reversible in models with 
respect to CO2 with a several-year lag (Boucher et al., 2012).  
 
Abrupt and irreversible changes in the climate system are assessed across multiple chapters in AR6. This 
section provides a cross-chapter synthesis of these assessments as an update to the AR5 Table 12.4 and 
SROCC Table 6.1. Understanding of abrupt climate change and irreversibility has advanced considerably 
since AR5 with many of the projected changes in proposed Tipping Elements having grown more confident 
(Table 4.10). Many aspects of the physical climate changes induced by GHG warming previously 
demonstrated to be reversible in a single model have been confirmed in multiple models (Boucher et al., 
2012; Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015) with others such as sea-level rise or terrestrial ecosystems confirmed to 
continue to respond on long timescales (Clark et al., 2016; Zickfeld et al., 2017; Pugh et al., 2018). 
 
The Carbon Dioxide Removal Model Intercomparison Project (CDR-MIP) (Keller et al., 2018) comprises a 
set of 1% ramp-up ramp-down simulations aimed at establishing a multi-model assessment of reversibility of 
Earth system components. Preliminary results from CDRMIP are presented in Section 4.6.3. Results from 
the SSP5-3.4-Overshoot scenario and other quantities of climate change at the same CO2 level before and 
after overshoot are assessed in Section 4.6.2. Forcing reversal is followed by reversal of ocean surface and 
land temperature along with land and ocean precipitation, snow cover, and Arctic sea ice with a lag of a few 
years to decades (Table 4.10). Other tipping elements have much longer timescales of reversibility from 
decades to millennia. (Drijfhout et al., 2015) provided an assessment of 13 regional mechanisms of abrupt 
change, finding abrupt changes in sea ice, oceanic flows, land ice, and terrestrial ecosystem response, 
although with little consistency among the models. The potential for abrupt changes in ice sheets, the 
AMOC, tropical forests, and ecosystem responses to ocean acidification were also recently reviewed by 
(Good et al., 2018). They found that some degree of irreversible loss of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) 
may have already begun, that tropical forests are adversely affected by drought, and rapid development of 
aragonite undersaturation at high latitudes affecting calcifying organisms. 
 
New since AR5 is the fundamental recognition in SRCCL and in this Report (Chapter 5) that projected 
changes in forests strongly depend on the human disturbance and that tropical forest dieback in the absence 
of disturbance is largely driven by the increased potential for drought, while that in boreal forests includes 
both thermal and hydrological factors (Drijfhout et al., 2015). For some proposed tipping elements, the role 
of seasonal change has become better understood. For  example, the lack of a tipping point in the reduction 
of summer Arctic sea-ice area (Stroeve and Notz, 2015) has been further substantiated. The role of abrupt 
change at the edges (Bathiany et al., 2020) has also been clarified, as has been the importance of 
distinguishing summer from winter mechanisms and associated abruptness, because ice area reduces 
gradually in summer, but not necessarily in winter (Bathiany et al., 2016). For other tipping elements 
including AMOC (Section 9.2.3.1), mixed layer depth (9.2.1.3), and sea-level rise (9.6.3.5), an increase in 
the diversity of model structure and sensitivity to multiple factors has led to a better understanding of the 
complexity of the problem, with some increase in assessed uncertainty and an assessed deep uncertainty (see 
Annex VII: Glossary) related to projected sea-level rise with global warming levels above 3°C (Section 
9.6.3.5). In still other cases such as Antarctic Sea Ice (Section 9.3.2) and Southern Ocean Meridional 
Overturning Circulation (MOC; Section 9.2.3.1), uncertainty remains high. Finally, it has also been 
postulated that models may be prone to being too stable (Valdes, 2011) based on the limitations of models as 
well as other lines of evidence such paleo-evidence of abrupt events (Dakos et al., 2008; Klus et al., 2018; 
Sime et al., 2019).

# 4.8  Low-Likelihood High-Warming Storylines  
 
Previous IPCC assessments have primarily assessed the projected likely range of changes (e.g., (Collins et 
al., 2013), see also BOX 1.1). The focus on the likely range partly results from the design of model 
intercomparison projects that are not targeted to systematically assess the upper and lower bounds of 
projections, which in principle would require a systematic sampling of structural and parametric model 
uncertainties. The upper and lower bounds of model projections may further be sensitive to the missing 
representation of processes and to deep uncertainties about aspects of the climate system (Section 1.2.3.1).  
 
However, a comprehensive risk assessment requires taking into account also high potential levels of 
warming whose likelihood is low, but potential impacts on society and ecosystems are high (Xu and 
Ramanathan, 2017a; Sutton, 2018). Climate-related risks have been argued to increase with increasing levels 
of global warming even if their likelihood decreases (O’Neill et al., 2017). Thus, it has recently been argued 
that an assessment that is too narrowly focused on the likely range potentially ignores the changes in the 
physical climate system associated with the highest risks ((Sutton, 2018), see Section 1.4.4.1).  

Given that the CMIP experiments can be considered ensembles of opportunity that are not designed for 
probabilistic assessments, alternative approaches such as physically plausible high-impact scenarios (Sutton, 
2018) or storylines have been suggested to investigate the tail of the distribution (Lenderink et al., 2014; 
Zappa and Shepherd, 2017; Kjellström et al., 2018; Shepherd et al., 2018) (see Section 1.4.4). Such 
storylines informed by a combination of process understanding, model evidence, and paleo information can 
be used for risk assessment and adaptation planning to test how well adaptation strategies would cope if the 
impacts of climate change were more severe than suggested by the likely model range (see Chapter 1 Section 
1.4.4). Note that by definition the lower bound of the likely model range (see Box 4.1) is equally likely as the 
upper bound. However, low-warming storylines are not specifically assessed in this section to focus on 
storylines associated with highest risks. This section further focuses on storylines of high and very high 
global warming levels along with their manifestation in global patterns of temperature and precipitation 
changes. However, this does not account for the largest potential changes at regional levels, which would 
require taking into account storylines of regional changes dependent on changes in atmospheric circulation, 
land-atmosphere interactions, and regional to local feedbacks.   
 
This section adopts an approach suggested in Sutton (2018). Since changes in temperature and precipitation 
tend to increase with the level of warming (Section 4.6.1), low-likelihood high-warming storylines are here 
illustrated for a level of warming consistent with the upper bound of the assessed very likely range (see 
Section 4.3.4) and for a level of warming above the very likely range. ECS and TCR are the dominant 
sources of uncertainty in projections of future warming under moderate to strong emission scenarios (Section 
7.5.7). Thus, a very high level of warming may occur if ECS and TCR are close to or above the upper bound 
of the assessed very likely range, which, to agree with historical trends, would require a strong historical 
aerosol cooling and/or strong SST pattern effects, combined with strong positive cloud feedback and 
substantial biases in paleoclimate temperature reconstructions, each of which are assessed as either unlikely 
or very unlikely, though not ruled out (Section 7.5.5). 
 
For SSP1-2.6, the warming consistent with the upper bound of the assessed very likely range corresponds to 
a warming of 1.5°C in 2081–2100 relative to 1995–2014 and 2.4°C relative to 1850–1900 (Section 4.3.4), a 
warming well above the 2°C warming level even in SSP1-2.6. Based on different lines of evidence, Figure 
4.41 illustrates by how much such a low-likelihood high-warming storyline exceeds the warming pattern 
consistent with the assessed best estimate GSAT warming of 0.9°C relative to 1995–2014. The first estimate 
(Figure 4.41, second row) is based on the assumption that the multi-model mean temperature pattern scales 
linearly with global mean warming. While linear scaling provides an appropriate approximation for changes 
in temperatures patterns at lower levels of warming (Section 4.2.4), this assumption cannot easily be tested 
for an extrapolation to higher levels of warming. Thus, a second estimate (Figure 4.41, third row) is based on 
the average of the five models that simulate a GSAT warming most consistent with the upper bound of the 
assessed very likely range (see Box 4.1 and Section 4.3.4; note some of the models share components). The 
two estimates for the annual mean temperature pattern for a low-likelihood high-warming storyline 
consistently show a warming pattern that substantially exceeds the best estimate warming pattern in most 
regions except around the North Atlantic and the parts of the Arctic. Pattern scaling suggests more than 50% 
warming above the best estimate, with 2−3°C warming over much of Eurasia and North America and more 
than 4°C warming relative to 1995–2014 over the Arctic (Figure 4.41c). The other approach based on five 
models shows less warming than the best estimate and even larger area of cooling in the North Atlantic but 
more warming than the best estimate over much of the tropical Pacific, Atlantic, around Antarctica and other 
the land regions (Figure 4.41e).  
 
For the high-emission scenarios SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, a high-warming storyline is associated with wide-
spread warming that exceeds the already high best-estimate warming by another 35−50%. For SSP5-8.5, this 
corresponds to a warming of 1°C−3°C in addition to the best estimate over most land regions, which implies 
more than 6°C relative to 1995–2014 over most extra-tropical land regions and Amazonia. Over large parts 
of the Arctic, annual mean temperatures increase by more than 10°C relative to 1995–2014 in such a high-
warming storyline under SSP5-8.5. The two lines of evidence yield more consistent patterns for SSP5-8.5 
than for SSP1-2.6, but there are substantial differences concerning whether the strongest warming above the 
best estimate occurs over the tropics or extratropical land regions. 

While individual models project even stronger warming over extratropical land regions (Figure 4.41 bottom 
row), their projected GSAT warming exceeds the assessed very likely 5–95% range and thus correspond to 
an extremely unlikely (below 5% likelihood) storyline. While all the models consistent with such a storyline 
tend to overestimate the observed warming trend over the historical period (Brunner et al., 2020; Liang et al., 
2020; Nijsse et al., 2020; Tokarska et al., 2020; Ribes et al., 2021), some of them show a good representation 
of several aspects of the present-day climate (Andrews et al., 2019; Sellar et al., 2019; Swart et al., 2019). 
Such a very high-warming storyline implies widespread warming of more than 1.5°C and 3°C above the 
best-estimate warming pattern under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively. Under SSP1-2.6, this corresponds 
to more than 3°C warming relative to 1995–2014 over land regions in the northern mid- to high latitudes and 
more than 6°C in the Arctic (Figure 4.41g). Under SSP5-8.5, such a very high-warming storyline implies 
more than 8°C warming over parts of Amazonia and more than 6°C over most other tropical land regions 
(Figure 4.41h).  
 
<figref>4.41</figref> 
 
High-warming storylines are very likely also associated with substantial changes in the hydrological cycle 
due to strong thermodynamic changes, which can be amplified or offset by dynamical changes (Emori and 
Brown, 2005; Seager et al., 2014b; Chavaillaz et al., 2016b; Kröner et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2019). Here the 
assessment of the hydrological cycle in high-warming storylines is limited to changes in annual mean 
precipitation, but changes in seasonal mean precipitation can be even stronger due to enhanced seasonality in 
many regions (Chapter 8, Box 8.2).  
 
Quantifying precipitation changes associated with high-warming storylines is challenging since models show 
the largest changes in precipitation over different regions (Sections 4.5.1 and 4.6.1). In some areas, models 
project opposing signals in different seasons or a combination of decreasing mean and increasing extreme 
precipitation (Kendon et al., 2014; Ban et al., 2015; Giorgi et al., 2016; Pendergrass et al., 2017). Models 
with the most pronounced GSAT warming are not necessarily associated with the strongest precipitation 
response in all regions, in part due to projected changes in atmospheric dynamics (Madsen et al., 2017; 
Zappa and Shepherd, 2017; Li et al., 2018). 
 
Different alternative estimates of changes in annual mean precipitation patterns consistent with high-
warming levels are compared here. The first estimate (Figure 4.42b) is based on a linear pattern scaling of 
the multi-model mean precipitation pattern for SSP5-8.5 (Figure 4.42a) to be consistent with the upper 
bound of the assessed very likely GSAT range (see above). This estimate is reasonably consistent with the 
average response of the five models with GSAT warming most consistent with the upper bound of the very 
likely warming range (Figure 4.42c) except for Australia. Both estimates show about 30−40% larger changes 
in annual mean precipitation than the response pattern consistent with the best GSAT estimate. In a high-
warming storyline, widespread increases of more than 30% occur in many regions north of 50°N and over 
parts of the tropics. Around the Mediterranean and other parts of the subtropics, a high-warming storyline is 
associated with a reduction in annual mean precipitation of more than 30% depending on the season.  
 
Both the multi-model mean and the pattern-scaled responses show a smoother pattern than in individual 
simulations (Tebaldi and Knutti, 2007; Knutti et al., 2010), because the multi-model mean filters out internal 
variability and because model differences in the location of the largest change tend to cancel. Individual 
model simulations show opposing signs in precipitation change such as over parts of Australia, the west 
coast of North America, parts of West Africa and India (Figure 4.42d), which tend to offset in the multi-
model mean response. The spatial probability distribution of precipitation changes shows that areas of strong 
precipitation increase or decrease occur in all models (Figure 4.42g, see also Section 4.6.1). However, due to 
the spatial smoothing, the multi-model mean response shows a lower area fraction of drying than most of the 
individual models (Tebaldi and Knutti, 2007; Knutti et al., 2010). The five models with GSAT warming 
consistent with a high-warming storyline and the two models projecting GSAT warming exceeding the very 
likely GSAT warming range show a much larger area fraction of drying and somewhat larger fraction of 
strong precipitation increases than the multi-model mean (Figure 4.42 b–d).  
 
The high-warming storyline shown in Figure 4.42b, c does not correspond to an upper or lower estimate of 
annual precipitation increase and decrease over individual locations, which in many regions may differ in the 
sign of the response (Figure 4.42e, f) due to differences in the model response and internal variability 
(Madsen et al., 2017). Figure 4.42e, f illustrates upper and lower local estimates corresponding to the 5–95% 
model range of local uncertainties as opposed to the global-warming storylines. Note, however, that Figure 
4.42e, f does not show a physically plausible global precipitation response pattern, because information at 
the different grid points is taken from different model simulations.  
 
Again, the manifestation of changes in the hydrological cycle for a high-warming storyline is not limited to 
precipitation, but would substantially affect other variables such as soil moisture, runoff, atmospheric 
humidity, and evapotranspiration. The changes are also not limited to annual mean precipitation but may be 
stronger or weaker for individual seasons and for precipitation extremes and dry spells. 
 
While this assessment is limited to temperature and precipitation, such a high-warming storyline would 
manifest itself also in other climate variables (Sanderson et al., 2011) assessed in this chapter such as Arctic 
sea ice, atmospheric circulation changes, and sea-level rise (Ramanathan and Feng, 2008; Xu and 
Ramanathan, 2017b; Steffen et al., 2018).  
 
In summary, while high-warming storylines – those associated with global warming levels above the upper 
bound of the assessed very likely range – are by definition extremely unlikely, they cannot be ruled out. For 
SSP1-2.6, such a high-warming storyline implies warming well above rather than well below 2°C (high 
confidence). Irrespective of scenario, high-warming storylines imply changes in many aspects of the climate 
system that exceed the patterns associated with the best estimate of GSAT changes by up to more than 50% 
(high confidence).
