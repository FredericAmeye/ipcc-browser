# 10.es Executive Summary 
 
Although climate change is a global phenomenon, its manifestations and consequences are different in 
different regions, and therefore climate information on spatial scales ranging from sub-continental to local is 
used for impact and risk assessments. Chapter 10 assesses the foundations of how regional climate 
information is distilled from multiple, sometimes contrasting, lines of evidence. Starting from the assessment 
of global-scale observations in Chapter 2, Chapter 10 assesses the challenges and requirements associated 
with observations relevant at the regional scale. Chapter 10 also assesses the fitness of modelling tools 
available for attributing and projecting anthropogenic climate change in a regional context starting from the 
methodologies assessed in Chapters 3 and 4. Regional climate change is the result of the interplay between 
regional responses to both natural forcings and human influence (considered in Chapters 2, 5, 6 and 7), 
responses to large-scale climate phenomena characterizing internal variability (considered in Chapters 1–9), 
and processes and feedbacks of a regional nature. 
 
Chapter 10 is the first of four chapters that assess regional-scale information in this report. The region-by-
region assessment of past and future changes in extremes (Chapter 11), climatic impact-drivers (Chapter 12) 
and mean climate (Atlas) relies on the sources and methodologies used for constructing regional climate 
change information assessed in Chapter 10. Building on the assessment of observations and modelling tools 
of Chapter 10, Chapter 11 assesses the observation and modelling of extremes. Chapter 10 assesses 
methodologies to attribute multi-decadal regional trends to the interplay between external forcing and 
internal variability, while Chapter 11 assesses the attribution of extreme events. The assessment of climate 
services in Chapter 12 builds on the assessment of distillation of regional climate information from multiple 
lines of evidence in Chapter 10. 
 
*Distilling regional climate information from multiple lines of evidence and taking the user context into 
account will increase the fitness, usefulness and relevance for decision-making and enhances the trust 
users will have in applying it (high confidence).* This distillation process can draw upon multiple 
observational datasets, ensembles of different model types, process understanding, expert judgement and 
indigenous knowledge. Important elements of distillation include attribution studies, the characterization of 
possible outcomes associated with internal variability and a comprehensive assessment of observational, 
model and forcing uncertainties and possible contradictions using different analysis methods. Taking the 
values of the relevant actors into account when co-producing climate information, and translating this 
information into the broader user context, improves the usefulness and uptake of this information (high 
confidence). {10.5}   
 
## Observations and Models as Sources of Regional Information 
 
*The use of multiple sources of observations and tailored diagnostics to evaluate climate model 
performance increases trust in future projections of regional climate (high confidence).* The availability 
of multiple observational records, including reanalyses, that are fit for evaluating the phenomena of interest 
and account for observational uncertainty, are fundamental for both understanding past regional climate 
change and assessing climate model performance at regional scales (high confidence). Employing tailored, 
process-oriented and potentially multivariate diagnostics to evaluate whether a climate model realistically 
simulates relevant aspects of present-day regional climate increases trust in future projections of these 
aspects (high confidence). {10.2.2, 10.3.3} 
 
*Currently, scarcity and reduced availability of adequate observations increase the uncertainty of long-
term temperature and precipitation estimates (virtually certain).* Precipitation measurements in 
mountainous areas, especially of solid precipitation, are strongly affected by gauge location and setup (very 
high confidence). Over data-scarce regions or over complex orography, gridded temperature and 
precipitation products are strongly affected by interpolation methods. Lack of access to the raw station data 
used to create gridded products compromises the trustworthiness of these products since the influence of the 
gridding process on the product cannot be assessed. The use of statistical homogenization methods reduces 
uncertainties related to long-term warming estimates at regional scales (virtually certain) {10.2.2, 10.6.2, 
10.6.3, 10.6.4, Box 10.3}.  
 
*Regional reanalyses provide surrogates of observed climate variables that are highly relevant in areas 
with scarce surface observations.* Regional reanalyses represent the distributions of precipitation, surface 
air temperature, and surface wind, including the frequency of extremes, better than global reanalyses (high 
confidence). However, their usefulness is limited by their short length, the typical regional model errors, and 
the relatively simple data assimilation algorithms. {Section 10.2.1}  
 
*Global and regional climate models are important sources of climate information at the regional scale.* 
Global models by themselves provide a useful line of evidence for the construction of regional climate 
information through the attribution or projection of forced changes or the quantification of the role of the 
internal variability (high confidence). Dynamical downscaling using regional climate models adds value in 
representing many regional weather and climate phenomena, especially over regions of complex orography 
or with heterogeneous surface characteristics (very high confidence). Increasing climate model resolution 
improves some aspects of model performance (high confidence). Some local-scale phenomena such as land-
sea breezes and mountain wind systems can only be realistically represented by simulations at a resolution of 
the order of 10 km or finer (high confidence). Simulations at kilometre-scale resolution add value in 
particular to the representation of convection, sub-daily precipitation extremes (high confidence) and soil-
moisture precipitation feedbacks (medium confidence). Sensitivity experiments aid the understanding of 
regional processes and can provide additional user-relevant information. {10.3.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6}.  
 
*The performance of global and regional climate models and their fitness for future projections depend 
on their representation of relevant processes, forcings and drivers and on the specific context.* 
Improving global model performance for regional scales is fundamental for increasing their usefulness as 
regional information sources. It is also key for improving the boundary conditions for dynamical 
downscaling and the input for statistical approaches, in particular when regional climate change is strongly 
influenced by large-scale circulation changes. Increasing resolution per se does not solve all performance 
limitations. Including the relevant forcings (e.g., aerosols, land-use change and stratospheric ozone 
concentrations) and representing the relevant feedbacks (e.g., snow–albedo, soil-moisture–temperature, soil-
moisture–precipitation) in global and regional models is a prerequisite for reproducing historical regional 
trends and ensuring fitness for future projections (high confidence). The sign of projected regional changes 
of variables such as precipitation and wind speed is in some cases only simulated in a trustworthy manner if 
relevant regional processes are represented (medium confidence). {10.3.3, 10.4.1, 10.4.2, 10.6.2, Cross-
Chapter Box 10.2}.  
 
*Statistical downscaling, bias adjustment and weather generators are useful approaches for improving 
the representation of regional climate from dynamical climate models.* Statistical downscaling methods 
with carefully chosen predictors and an appropriate model structure for a given application realistically 
represent many statistical aspects of present-day daily temperature and precipitation (high confidence). Bias 
adjustment has proven beneficial as an interface between climate model projections and impact modelling in 
many different contexts (high confidence). Weather generators realistically simulate many statistical 
characteristics of present-day daily temperature and precipitation, such as extreme temperatures and wet- and 
dry-day transition probabilities (high confidence). {10.3.3}  
 
*The performance of statistical downscaling, bias adjustment and weather generators in climate change 
applications depends on the specific model and on the dynamical climate model driving it.* Knowledge 
is still limited about suitable predictors for statistical downscaling of regional climate change, particularly for 
precipitation. Bias adjustment cannot overcome all consequences of unresolved or strongly misrepresented 
physical processes, such as large-scale circulation biases or local feedbacks, and may instead introduce other 
biases and implausible climate change signals (medium confidence). Using bias adjustment as a method for 
statistical downscaling, particularly for coarse-resolution global models, may lead to substantial 
misrepresentations of regional climate and climate change (medium confidence). Instead, dynamical 
downscaling may resolve relevant local processes prior to bias adjustment, thereby improving the 
representation of regional changes. The performance of statistical approaches and their fitness for future 
projections depends on predictors and change factors taken from the driving dynamical models (high 
confidence) {10.3.3, Cross-Chapter Box 10.2}. 
 
*Different types of climate model ensembles allow for the assessment of regional climate projection 
uncertainties, although ensemble spread is not a full measure of the uncertainty (very high confidence).* 
Multi-model ensembles enable the assessment of regional climate response uncertainty (very high 
confidence). Discarding models that fundamentally misrepresent processes relevant for a given purpose 
improves the fitness of multi-model ensembles for generating regional climate information (high 
confidence). At the regional scale, multi-model mean and ensemble spread are not sufficient to characterize 
low-probability, high-impact changes or situations where different models simulate substantially different or 
even opposing changes (high confidence). In such cases, storylines aid the interpretation of projection 
uncertainties. Since AR5, the availability of multiple single-model initial-condition large ensembles 
(SMILEs) allows for a more robust separation of model uncertainty and internal variability in regional-scale 
projections and provides a more comprehensive spectrum of possible changes associated with internal 
variability (high confidence). {10.3.4}  
 
## Interplay between Human Influence and Internal Variability at Regional Scales 
 
*Human influence has been a major driver of regional mean temperature change since 1950 in many 
sub-continental regions of the world (virtually certain).* Regional-scale detection and attribution studies as 
well as observed emergence analysis provide robust evidence supporting the dominant contribution of 
human influence to regional temperature changes over multidecadal periods. {10.4.1; 10.4.3} 
 
*While human influence has contributed to multi-decadal mean precipitation changes in several 
regions, internal variability can delay emergence of the anthropogenic signal in long-term 
precipitation changes in many land regions (high confidence).* Multiple attribution approaches, including 
optimal fingerprinting, grid-point detection, pattern recognition and dynamical adjustment methods, as well 
as multi-model, single-forcing large ensembles and multi-centennial paleoclimate records, support the 
contribution of human influence to several regional multi-decadal mean precipitation changes (high 
confidence). At regional scale, internal variability is stronger and uncertainties in observations, models and 
human influence are all larger than at the global scale, precluding a robust assessment of the relative 
contributions of greenhouse gases, stratospheric ozone, different aerosol species and land use/land cover 
changes. Multiple lines of evidence, combining multi-model ensemble global projections with those coming 
from SMILEs, show that internal variability is largely contributing to the delayed or absent emergence of the 
anthropogenic signal in long-term regional mean precipitation changes (high confidence). {10.4.1, 10.4.2, 
10.4.3, 10.6.3, 10.6.4} 
 
*Various mechanisms operating at different time scales can modify the amplitude of the regional-scale 
response of temperature, and both the amplitude and sign of the response of precipitation, to human 
influence (high confidence).* These mechanisms include non-linear temperature, precipitation and soil 
moisture feedbacks, slow and fast responses of sea surface temperature patterns and atmospheric circulation 
changes to increasing greenhouse gases. {10.4.3} 
 
## Urban Climate 
 
*Many types of urban parameterizations simulate radiation and energy exchanges in a realistic way 
(very high confidence).* For urban climate studies focusing on the interplay between the urban heat island 
and regional climate change, a simple single-layer parameterization is fit for purpose (medium confidence). 
New networks of monitoring stations in urban areas provide key information to enhance the understanding of 
urban microclimates and improve urban parameterizations. {Box 10.3} 
 
*The difference in observed warming trends between cities and their surroundings can partly be 
attributed to urbanization (very high confidence).* Annual-mean daily minimum temperature is more 
affected by urbanization than annual-mean daily maximum temperature (very high confidence). The global 
annual-mean surface air temperature response to urbanization is, however, negligible (very high confidence). 
{Box 10.3} 
 
*Future urbanization will amplify the projected air temperature change in cities regardless of the 
characteristics of the background climate, resulting in a warming signal on minimum temperatures 
that could be as large as the global warming signal (very high confidence).* A large effect is expected 
from the combination of future urban development and more frequent occurrence of extreme climatic events, 
such as heatwaves (very high confidence). {Box 10.3} 
 
## Distillation of Regional Climate Information 
 
*The process of distilling regional climate information from multiple lines of evidence can vary 
substantially from one case to another.* Although methodologies for distillation have been established, the 
process is in practice conditioned by the sources available, the actors involved and the context, which depend 
heavily on the regions considered, and framed by the question being addressed. To make the most 
appropriate decisions and responses to changing climate, it is necessary to consider all physically plausible 
outcomes from multiple lines of evidence, especially in the case when they are contrasting. {10.5, 10.6, 
Cross-Chapter Box 10.1, Cross-Chapter Box 10.3}  
 
*Confidence in the distilled regional climate information is enhanced when there is agreement across 
multiple lines of evidence.* For example, the apparent contradiction between the observed decrease in Indian 
monsoon rainfall over the second half of the 20th century and the projected long-term increase is explained 
by attribution of the trends to different forcings, with aerosols dominating recently and greenhouse gases in 
the future (high confidence). For the Mediterranean region, the agreement between different lines of 
evidence, such as observations, projections by regional and global models, and understanding of the 
underlying mechanisms, provides high confidence in summer warming that exceeds the global average. 
{10.5.3, 10.6, 10.6.3, 10.6.4, Cross-Chapter Box 10.3} 
 
*The outcome of distilling regional climate information can be limited by inconsistent or contradictory 
information.* Initial observational analyses of the Cape Town drying showed a strong, post-1979 association 
between increasing greenhouse gases, changes in a key mode of variability (the Southern Annular Mode) and 
drought in the Cape Town region. However, not all global models show this association, and subsequent 
analysis extending farther back in time, when human influence was weaker, showed no strong association in 
observations between the Southern Annular Mode and Cape Town drought. Thus, despite the consistency 
among global-model future projections, there is medium confidence in a projected future drier climate for 
Cape Town. Likewise, the distillation process results in low confidence in the influence of Arctic warming 
on mid-latitude climate because of contrasting lines of evidence. {10.5.3, 10.6.2, Cross-Chapter Box 10.1, 
Cross-Chapter Box 10.3}  
 
# 10.1  Foundations for regional climate change information 
 
## 10.1.1  Introduction 
 
This chapter assesses the foundations for the distillation of regional climate change information from 
multiple lines of evidence. The AR5, SR1.5 and SRCCL reports underlined the relevance of assessing 
regional climate information that is useful and relevant to the decision scale (Box 10.1). To respond to this 
need, the WGI report of AR6 includes four regional chapters of which this is the first one. Chapter 10 
assesses the sources and methodologies used by the Chapters 11, 12 and Atlas to construct regional 
information. Chapter 10 builds on the assessment of methodologies considered to contruct global climate 
change information in Chapters 2–4 and on the processes assessed in Chapters 5–9. Additionally, this 
chapter assesses the methodologies for the co-production of regional climate information, the role of the 
different actors involved in the process and the relevance of the user context and values. 
 
Regional climate change refers to a change in climate in a given region (Section 10.1.2.1) identified by 
changes in the mean or higher moments of the probability distribution of a climate variable and persisting for 
a few decades or longer. It can also refer to a change in temporal properties such as persistence and 
frequency of occurrence of weather and climate extreme events. Regional climate change may be caused by 
natural internal processes such as atmospheric internal variability and local climate response to low-
frequency modes of climate variability (Technical Annex IV), as well as by changes in external forcings 
such as modulations of the solar cycle, orbital forcing, volcanic eruptions, and persistent anthropogenic 
changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use and land cover (Cross-Chapter Box 3.2; IPCC, 
2018a), in addition to the interactions and feedbacks between them. Process interaction in space is pervasive, 
which means that small spatial scales have an influence on the larger scales (Palmer, 2013). Depending on 
the context, a region may refer to a large area such as a monsoon region, but may also be confined to smaller 
areas such as coastlines, mountain ranges or human settlements like cities. Users (understood as anyone 
incorporating climate information into their activity) often request climate information for these range of 
scales since their operating and adaptation decision scales range from the local to the sub-continental level. 
 
Given the many types of regional climates, the broad range of spatial and temporal scales (Section 10.1.2), 
and the diversity of user needs, a variety of methodologies and approaches have been developed to construct 
regional climate change information. The sources include global and regional climate model simulations, 
statistical downscaling and bias adjustment methods. A commonly used source is long-term (end-of century) 
model projections of regional climate change, as well as near-term (next 10 years) climate predictions 
(Kushnir et al., 2019; Rössler et al., 2019a). Regional observations, with their associated challenges, are a 
key source for the regional climate information construction process (Li et al., 2020b). High-quality 
observations that enable monitoring of the regional aspects of climate are used to adjust inherent model 
biases and are the basis for assessing model performance. Process understanding and attribution of observed 
changes to large- and regional-scale anthropogenic and natural drivers and forcings are also important 
sources. 
 
All these sources are used, when available, to distil regional climate information from multiple lines of 
evidence (Figure 10.1). The resulting climate information can then be integrated, following a co-production 
process involving both the user and the producer, into a user context that often is already taken into account 
when constructing the regional climate information. In fact, the distillation process leading to the climate 
information can consider the specific context of the question at stake, the values of both the user and the 
producer, and the challenge of communicating across different communities (Section 10.5). 
 
The chapter (Figure 10.2) starts with an introduction of the concepts used in the distillation of regional 
climate information (Section 10.1). Section 10.2 addresses the aspects associated with the access to and use 
of observations, while different modelling approaches are introduced and assessed in Section 10.3. Section 
10.3 also addresses the performance of models in simulating relevant climate characteristics as needed to 
estimate the credibility of future projections. Section 10.4 assesses the interplay between anthropogenic 
causes and internal variability at regional scales, and its relevance for the attribution of regional climate 
changes and the emergence of regional climate change signals. Section 10.5 tackles the issue of how regional 
climate information is distilled from different sources taking into account the context and the values of both 
the producer and the user. Section 10.6 illustrates the distillation approach using three comprehensive 
examples. Finally, Section 10.7 lists some limitations to the assessment of regional climate information.

## 10.1.2  Regional Climate Change and the Relevant Spatial and Temporal Scales 
 
The global coupled atmosphere-ocean-land-cryosphere system, including its feedbacks, shows variability 
over a wide spectrum of spatial and temporal scales (Hurrell et al., 2009). This section discusses concepts 
and definitions of what can be considered a region, the relevant temporal scales and region-specific aspects 
of the baselines used. 
 
<figref>10.3</figref> 
 
### 10.1.2.1  Spatial scales and definition of regions 
 
Large-scale climate and the associated phenomena have been defined in Chapter 2 (e.g., Cross-Chapter Box 
2.2) as ranging from global and hemispheric, to ocean-basin and continental scales. The definition of the 
regional scale is case specific in the WGI AR6 report. Section 1.4.5 provides definitions of the different 
regional types adopted by the different Chapters. In this chapter, regional scales are defined as ranging from 
the size of sub-continental areas (e.g., the Mediterranean basin) to local scales (e.g., coastlines, mountain 
ranges and cities) without prescribing any formal regional boundaries. These spatial length scales range from 
a few thousand down to a few kilometres and the relevant driving modes and processes at regional scales are 
summarized in Figure 10.3. In contrast to Chapters 11, 12 and Atlas, which make a region-by-region 
assessment of climate change, this chapter does not necessarily restrict itself to the use of the AR6 regions 
(Sections 1.4.5, Atlas.1.3). Different regional definitions have been used in sections 10.4 and 10.6, selected 
for their adequacy to illustrate methodological aspects (e.g., for the attribution of long-term regional trends, 
regions that display such trends have been selected). Typological regions (Sections 1.4.5, Atlas.1.3) are used 
in Box 10.3 and Cross-Chapter Box 10.4. 
 
 
### 10.1.2.2  Temporal scales, baselines and dimensions of integration 
 
The concept of a unified and seamless framework for weather and climate prediction (Brown et al., 2012a; 
Hoskins, 2013) provides the context for understanding and simulating regional climate across multiple 
spatial and temporal scales. This concept is embodied in the subseasonal-to-seasonal (Vitart et al., 2017) and 
the seasonal-to-multiannual (Smith et al., 2020) prediction activities that generate regional climate 
information across temporal scales. The seamless framework benefits from the convergence of methods 
traditionally used in weather forecasting and climate projections, in particular the role of the initialization in 
climate models and the strategies for the evaluation of physical processes relevant at different temporal 
scales. 
 
The relatively short observational record (Section 10.2, Chapter 2) is a primary challenge to estimate the 
forced signal and to isolate low-frequency, multi-decadal and longer term internal variability (Frankcombe et 
al., 2015; Overland et al., 2016; Bathiany et al., 2018). Because only one realization of the actual climate 
exists, it is nontrivial to extract estimates of internal and forced variability from the available data 
(Frankcombe et al., 2015). As an alternative, approaches that use large observational ensembles can be 
applied (Section 10.4; McKinnon and Deser, 2018). 
 
There is a close relationship between spatial and temporal scales (Figure 10.3). For example, an individual 
convective storm may exhibit scales of variability ranging from metres and seconds to kilometres and hours, 
while for El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) the scales of variability are regional to hemispheric in extent 
and multi-year in length. These scales interact and the interactions are represented in climate models, 
although the ability of current models to simulate regional phenomena and even large-scale climate drivers 
still leaves room for improvement (Section 10.3) and limits their capability to represent the interactions 
across spatial and temporal scales. 
 
It is important to note that in this chapter and subsequent regional chapters, including the Interactive Atlas, 
the baselines and reference periods used for climate change estimates from regional models may vary from 
those used in Chapters 1–9. In these chapters three main time baselines are defined for the past, i.e., pre-
industrial (1750), early-industrial (1850–1900) and recent (1995–2014), while the future reference periods 
are 2021–2040 (near term), 2041–2060 (mid-century) and 2081–2100 (long term) (Section 1.4.1, Cross-
Chapter Box 1.2). Regional climate simulations used in the recent literature have been performed with 
different baselines. The differences are often due to the availability of the boundary conditions from global 
simulations, leading to periods chosen for those simulations like 1950–2005, in line with the CMIP5 
historical simulations followed by projections from 2005 onwards (Vaittinada Ayar et al., 2016; Dong-feng 
et al., 2017; Cai et al., 2018a). For simulations that use CMIP3 boundary conditions other periods have been 
used. As a consequence, these regional simulations mix for the recent period historical simulations with 
projections. The mismatch needs to be considered when assessing results obtained from both global and 
regional models in the context of the climate information distillation process, or when linking the regional 
chapters to the assessments performed in previous chapters. The choice of baseline provides a source of 
uncertainty for the assessment of climate impacts (e.g., for the response of bird species in Africa; Baker et 
al., 2016). Besides, a range of different baselines may need to be considered to satisfy a variety of users, 
since this choice affects the perceived result (Dobor and Hlásny, 2018). The influence of the different 
baseline periods can be explored using the Interactive Atlas where different baselines are available, for 
example, 1986-2005 (according to AR5), 1995-2014 (AR6), and both 1961-1990 and 1981-2010 (WMO). 
 
One way of overcoming the baseline uncertainty is to define the results for a given model based on specific 
global-mean temperature changes from the pre-industrial period (e.g., Sylla et al., 2018a for West Africa; 
Kjellström et al., 2018 for Europe; Taylor et al., 2018 for the Caribbean; Montroull et al., 2018 for South 
America). The specific global-mean temperature is known as global warming level (GWL; Sections 1.6.2 
and 10.6.4, Cross-Chapter Box 11.1). The GWL is a useful dimension of integration because important 
changes in regional climate, including many types of extremes, scale quasi-linearly with the GWLs, often 
independently of the underlying emissions scenarios (e.g., Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; Beusch et al., 2020; 
Seneviratne and Hauser, 2020), taking always into account caveats described in Cross-Chapter Box 11.1. In 
addition, GWLs allow a separated analysis of the global and regional climate responses associated with a 
warming level (Seneviratne and Hauser, 2020; Section 10.6.4). The choice of global temperature goal in the  
context of the 2015 Paris Agreement means that there is an increasing desire for the regional climate 
information to be expressed as a function of GWLs. 
 
 
## 10.1.3  Sources of Regional Climate Variability and Change 
 
Variability in regional climate arises from natural and anthropogenic forcings, internal variability including 
the local expression of large-scale remote drivers (also known as teleconnections), and the feedbacks 
between them. Due to the many possible drivers of variability and change (Figure 10.3), quantifying the 
interplay between internal modes of decadal variability and any externally forced component is crucial in 
attempts to attribute causes of regional climate changes (e.g., Hoell et al., 2017; Nath et al., 2018). A 
regional climate signal could arise purely due to some anthropogenic influence or conversely, entirely due to 
internal variability, but it is most likely the result of a combination of both (Section 10.4). This section 
briefly introduces these sources of regional variability and should be read along with corresponding sections 
in Chapters 3, 6 and 7. Section 10.3 assesses their representation in climate models, Section 10.4 discusses 
their relevance for the attribution of multi-decadal trends and Section 10.6 refers to them as sources in 
specific examples where regional climate information is built. Section 8.2 offers a companion discussion 
focussing on changes in the water cycle. An example of how changes in one region could act as a source for 
changes in a neighbouring one is assessed in the Cross-Chapter Box 10.1 for the linkages between polar and 
mid-latitude regions, an interaction that has led to substantial recent research. This section also introduces 
the sources of uncertainty in model-derived regional climate information and how the quantification of the 
uncertainties influences the confidence of the regional climate information. 
 
 
### 10.1.3.1  Forcings controlling regional climate 
 
There are important differences in the processes affected by greenhouse gases (GHGs) over land and ocean. 
Over the ocean, the increased radiative forcing leads to an increase in latent heat flux and a decrease in 
sensible heat flux, while over land, water availability is limited and increased radiative energy is therefore 
converted mostly into sensible heat (Sutton et al., 2007). Notably, this leads to preferential warming of the 
land regions, which are themselves skewed towards the Northern Hemisphere. 
 
Variations in solar forcing (Section 2.2.1) could influence regional climate through its modulation of 
circulation patterns, although this research field is still hampered by large observational and modelling 
uncertainties. The 11-year solar cycle has been suggested to affect the leading atmospheric circulation modes 
of the North Atlantic region in model based studies (Gray et al., 2013; Thiéblemont et al., 2015; Sjolte et al., 
2018). In particular the solar cycle has been suggested as an important source of near-term predictability of 
the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO; Kushnir et al., 2019), while other studies have not found evidence for 
links between the solar cycle and NAO in observational records (Ortega et al., 2015; Sjolte et al., 2018; 
Chiodo et al., 2019). On centennial time scales, solar fluctuations were found to be correlated with the 
Eastern Atlantic Pattern (Sjolte et al., 2018). Possible influences on winter circulation and temperature over 
Eurasia (Chen et al., 2015) and North America (Liu et al., 2014; Li and Xiao, 2018) have also been 
identified. 
 
An updated assessment of past changes in stratospheric ozone can be found in Section 2.2.5.2. AR6 assesses 
that both GHG and stratospheric ozone depletion have contributed to the expansion of the zonal mean 
Hadley cell in the Southern Hemisphere for the period 1981–2000 with medium confidence (Section 3.3.3) 
(Garfinkel et al., 2015; Waugh et al., 2015; Grise et al., 2019). There is medium confidence that stratospheric 
ozone depletion contributed to the strengthening trend of the summer SAM for the period 1970-1990, but 
this influence has been weaker since 2000 (Section 3.7.2). The poleward shift of the Southern Hemisphere 
westerlies has also been explained by stratospheric ozone depletion (Solman and Orlanski, 2016). Section 
10.4 assesses its role in the multi decadal increase of rainfall in Southeastern South America and Section 
10.6.2 does so for the occurrence of the Cape Town drought. 
 
Both natural and anthropogenic aerosols are often emitted at a regional scale, have a short atmospheric 

lifetime (from a few hours to several days; Section 6.1), are dispersed regionally and affect climate at a 
regional scale through radiative cooling/heating and cloud microphysical effects (Rotstayn et al., 2015; 
Sherwood et al., 2015; Chapter 8). The majority of aerosols scatter solar radiation, but with strong regional 
variations (Shindell and Faluvegi, 2009) that lead to regional radiative effects of up to two orders of 
magnitude larger than the global average (Li et al., 2016c, 2016a; Mallet et al., 2016). Black carbon, instead, 
is known to absorb solar radiation, leading to regional atmospheric warming patterns due to its 
inhomogeneous spatial distribution (Gustafsson and Ramanathan, 2016). Patterns of forcing generally follow 
those of aerosol burden. However, temperature and precipitation responses are both local and remote (Li et 
al., 2016d; Kasoar et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018c; Samset et al., 2018; Thornhill et al., 2018; Westervelt et al., 
2018). For instance, changes in aerosol concentrations in the Northern Hemisphere have been reported to 
modulate monsoon precipitation in West Africa and the Sahel (Undorf et al., 2018; Section 10.4.2.1) and in 
Asia (Zhang et al., 2018; Section 10.6.3). 
 
Natural aerosols include mineral dust, volcanic aerosol and sea salt. The feedback processes between climate 
and mineral dust as well as sea salt are assessed in Section 6.4, while the volcanic aerosol is dealt with in 
Cross-Chapter Box 4.1. Mineral dust created by wind erosion of arid and semi-arid surfaces dominates the 
aerosol load over some areas. The major sources of contemporary dust are located in the arid topographic 
basins of Northern Africa, Middle East, Central and Southwest Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and East 
Asia (Prospero et al., 2002; Ginoux et al., 2012) and emissions are controlled by changes in surface winds, 
precipitation, and vegetation (Ridley et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015a; DeFlorio et al., 2016; Evan et al., 
2016; Pu and Ginoux, 2018). Dust both scatters and absorbs radiation and serves as nuclei of warm and cold 
clouds (Chapter 6). The surface direct radiative effect is likely negative over land and ocean, especially when 
the assumed solar absorption by dust is large (Miller et al., 2014; Strong et al., 2015). Surface temperature 
and precipitation adjust to the direct radiative effect with both sign and magnitude depending on the dust 
absorptive properties. Dust often cools the surface, but in regions such as the Sahara surface air temperature 
increases as the shortwave absorption by dust is increased, leading to increases of surface temperature over 
the major reflective dust sources (Miller et al., 2014; Solmon et al., 2015; Strong et al., 2015; Jin et al., 2016; 
Sharma and Miller, 2017). 
 
Volcanic eruptions load the atmosphere with large amounts of sulphur, which is transformed through 
chemical reactions and micro-physics processes into sulphate aerosols (Cross-Chapter Box 4.1; Stoffel et al., 
2015; LeGrande et al., 2016). If the plume reaches the stratosphere, sulphate aerosols can remain there for 
months or years (about two to three for large eruptions) and can then be transported to other areas by the 
Brewer-Dobson circulation. If the eruption occurs in the tropics, its plume is dispersed across the Earth in a 
few years, while if the eruption occurs in the high latitudes, aerosols mainly remain in the same hemisphere 
(Pausata et al., 2015). The global temperature response observed after the last five major eruptions of the last 
two centuries is estimated to be around -0.2°C (Swingedouw et al., 2017), in association with a general 
decrease of precipitation (Iles and Hegerl, 2017). Nevertheless, the statistical significance of the regional 
response remains difficult to evaluate over the historical era (Bittner et al., 2016; Swingedouw et al., 2017) 
due to the small sampling of large volcanic eruptions over this period and the fact that the signal is 
superimposed upon relatively large internal variability (Gao and Gao, 2018; Dogar and Sato, 2019). 
Evidence from paleoclimate observations is therefore crucial to obtain a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (Sigl 
et al., 2015). Reconstructed modes of climate variability based on proxy records allow evaluation of the 
influence on those modes (Zanchettin et al., 2013; Ortega et al., 2015; Michel et al., 2018; Sjolte et al., 
2018). 
 
Anthropogenic aerosols play a key role in climate change (Chapter 6). Although the global mean optical 
depth caused by anthropogenic aerosols did not change from 1975 to 2005 (Chapter 6), the regional pattern 
changed dramatically between Europe and eastern Asia (Fiedler et al., 2017, 2019; Stevens et al., 2017). 
Large regional differences in present-day aerosol forcing exist with consequences for regional temperature, 
hydrological cycle and modes of variability (Chapter 8, Section 10.6). Examples of regions with a notable 
role for anthropogenic aerosol forcing are the Indian monsoon region (Section 10.6.3) and the Mediterranean 
basin (Section 10.6.4). Anthropogenic aerosols are also very relevant in many urban areas (Box 10.3; Gao et 
al., 2016; Kajino et al., 2017). 
 
SRCCL assessed that nearly three-quarters of the land surface is under some form of land use, particularly in 
agriculture and forest management (Jia et al., 2019). The effects of land management on climate are much 
less studied than land cover effects although net cropland has changed little over the past 50 years, while 
land management has continuously changed (Jia et al., 2019). Section 7.3.4.1 assesses the global influence of 
both land use and irrigation on the effective radiative forcings. Land cover changes and land management 
can influence climate locally, such as the urban heat island and non-locally as in the case of increased 
rainfall downwind of a city (Jia et al., 2019, Box 10.3) or the monsoon circulation affected by irrigation 
(Section 10.6.3). The influence of land cover changes and land management on regional climate extremes is 
assessed in Section 11.1.6. 
 
It is very likely that the global land surface air temperature response to urbanization is negligible (Chapter 2, 
Section 2.3.1.1.3). However, there is evidence that urbanization may regionally amplify the air temperature 
response to climate change in different climatic zones (Mahmood et al., 2014), either under present (Doan et 
al., 2016; Kaplan et al., 2017; Li et al., 2018c) or future climate conditions (Argüeso et al., 2014; Kim et al., 
2016; Kusaka et al., 2016; Grossman-Clarke et al., 2017; Krayenhoff et al., 2018). For instance, in northern 
Belgium, (Berckmans et al., 2019) found that including urbanization scenarios for the near future (up to 
2035) have a comparable influence on minimum temperature (increasing it by 0.6ºC) to that of the GHG-
induced warming under RCP8.5. 
 
 
### 10.1.3.2  Internal drivers of regional climate variability 
 
Internal climate variability on seasonal to multi-decadal temporal scales is substantial at regional scales. This 
variability arises from internal modes of atmospheric and oceanic variability, intrinsically coupled climate 
modes, and may additionally be driven by processes other than those originating the modes. It also interacts 
with the response of the climate system to external forcing. The teleconnections associated with the modes 
are useful to understand the relationship between large and regional scales (Annex IV). A description of 
various large-scale modes of variability can be found in Chapters 2, 3 and 8, and in Annex IV, while their 
future projections are assessed in Chapter 4. The specificities of their regional influence are briefly discussed 
here. More details of their typical temporal scales and regional influences can be found in Annex IV. 
 
Atmospheric modes of variability may have seasonally-dependent regional effects like the North Atlantic 
Oscillation (NAO) in European winter (Tsanis and Tapoglou, 2019) and summer (Bladé et al., 2012; Dong et 
al., 2013). Even though these modes are internal to the climate system, their variability can be affected by 
anthropogenic forcings. For instance, the Southern Annular Mode (SAM; Hendon et al., 2014) is both 
internally driven (Smith and Polvani, 2017), but also affected by recent stratospheric ozone changes 
(Bandoro et al., 2014). The teleconnections between these modes of variability and surface weather often 
exhibit considerable non-stationarity (Hertig et al., 2015). 
 
Due to the large ocean heat capacity and their long temporal scales, multiannual to multi-decadal modes of 
ocean variability such as the Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV; Newman et al., 2016) and the Atlantic 
Multidecadal Variability (AMV; Buckley and Marshall, 2016) are key drivers of regional climate change. In 
the case of the AMV both natural (volcanic) and anthropogenic (aerosol) external forcings are thought to be 
involved in its timing and intensity (Section 3.7.7). These modes not only affect nearby regions but also 
remote parts of the globe through atmospheric teleconnections (Meehl et al., 2013; Dong and Dai, 2015) and 
can act to modulate the influence of natural and anthropogenic forcings (Davini et al., 2015; Ghosh et al., 
2017; Ménégoz et al., 2018b). The dynamics of the ocean modes is simultaneously affected by other modes 
of variability spanning the full range of spatial and temporal scales due to non-linear interactions (Kucharski 
et al., 2010; Dong et al., 2018) (Figure 10.3). This mutual interdependence can result in changing 
characteristics of the connection over time (Gallant et al., 2013; Brands, 2017; Dong and McPhaden, 2017), 
and of their regional climate impact (Martín-Gómez and Barreiro, 2016, 2017). As with atmospheric modes 
of variability, the regional influence of ocean modes of variability on regional climates can be seasonally 
dependent (Haarsma et al., 2015). 
 
### 10.1.3.3  Uncertainty and confidence 
 
Uncertainty and confidence are treated in the same way in regional climate change information as in larger-
scale (continental and global) climate problems (Chapter 1, Section 10.3.4). The degree of confidence in 
climate simulations and in the resulting climate information typically depends on the identification of the 
role of the uncertainties (Section 10.3.4). Since the direct verification of simulations of future climate 
changes is not possible, model performance and reliable (i.e., trustworthy) uncertainty estimates need to be 
assessed indirectly through process understanding and a systematic comparison with observations of past and 
current climate (Section 10.3.3; Eyring et al., 2019; Knutti et al., 2010). The observational uncertainty, 
which is particularly large at regional scales, also has to be taken into account (Section 10.2). These 
uncertainty estimates are then propagated in the distillation process to generate climate information (Smith 
and Matthews, 2015). 
 
Uncertainties in model-based future regional climate information arise from different sources and are 
introduced at various stages in the process (Lehner et al., 2020): 1) forcing uncertainties associated with the 
future scenario or pathway that is assumed, 2) internal variability, and 3) uncertainties related to 
imperfections in climate models, also referred to as structural or model uncertainty. However, the relative 
role of each of these sources of uncertainty differs between the global and the regional scales as well as 
between variables and also between different regions (Lehner et al., 2020). One way to address the internal 
variability and model uncertainties is to consider results from both multiple models and multiple realizations 
of the same model (Eyring et al., 2016a; Díaz et al., 2020; Lehner et al., 2020). These models are at times 
also combined with different weights that are a function of their performance and independence to increase 
the confidence of the multi-model ensemble (Abramowitz et al., 2019; Brunner et al., 2019).  
 
Other elements that play a role are the inconsistency between the global and regional models in dynamical 
downscaling or the observational and methodological uncertainty in bias-adjustment methods (Sørland et al., 
2018). These elements, in addition to those typical of the uncertainty in global and large-scale phenomena 
(Chapters 1‒9), affect the overall confidence of regional climate information. This complex scene with 
different sources of uncertainty makes the collection of results available from multi-model, multi-member 
simulations most useful when synthesized through a distillation process (Section 10.5.3). 
 
 
## 10.1.4  Distillation of Regional Climate Information 
 
Regional climate information is synthesized from different lines of evidence from a number of sources 
(Sections 10.2‒10.4) taking into account the context of a user vulnerable to climate variability and change at 
regional scales (Baztan et al., 2017) and the values of all relevant actors (Corner et al., 2014; Bessette et al., 
2017) in a process called distillation (Section 10.5). Distillation, understood as the process of synthesizing 
information about climate change from different lines of evidence obtained from a variety of sources and 
taking into account the user context and the values of all relevant actors, allows the connection of global 
climate change to the local and regional scales, where adaptation responses and policy decisions take place. 
Climate information is translated into the user context in a co-production process that introduces further 
user-relevant elements leading to user-relevant climate information (Figure 10.1; Pettenger, 2016; Verrax, 
2017) for a specific demand like, for instance, guiding climate-resilient development (Kruk et al., 2017; 
Parker and Lusk, 2019). 
 
The approaches adopted in the distillation of regional climate information are diverse and range from the 
simple delivery of data as information to co-production with the user using as many lines of evidence as 
possible (Lourenço et al., 2016). The availability and selection of the sources and the approach followed has 
implications for the usefulness of the information. For instance, it is well established that it is invalid to take 
a time series from a grid cell of a model simulation as equivalent to an observational estimate of a point 
within the cell, due to the lack of representativeness (Section 10.3), and consequently the information 
building solely on this type of data source is of limited use. Relevant decisions are made during the 
distillation process such as what method is most suitable to a specific user context and the question being 
addressed. The information may be provided in the form of summarised raw data, a set of user-oriented 
indicators, a set of figures and maps with either a brief description, in the form of a storyline, or formulated 
as rich and complex climate adaptation plans. The information typically includes a description of the sources 
and assumptions, estimates of the associated uncertainty and its sources, and guidance to prevent possible 
misunderstandings in its communication. 
 
The choices made for the distillation have typically been part of a linear supply chain, starting from the 
access to climate data that are transformed into maps or derived climate data products, and finally 
formulating statements that are communicated and delivered to a broad range of users (Hewitt et al., 2012; 
Hewitson et al., 2017). This methodology has proven to be valuable in many cases, but it is equally fraught 
with dangers of not communicating important assumptions, not estimating the impact of relevant 
uncertainties, and possibly causing misunderstandings in the hand-over to the user community. This has led 
to the emergence of new pathways to generate user-oriented climate information, many in the context of 
emerging climate services (Buontempo et al., 2018; Hewitt et al., 2020), which are assessed in Section 10.5 
and in Chapter 12. 
 
 
## 10.1.5  Regional Climate Information in the WGI AR6 
 
This chapter is part of a cluster devoted to regional climate (10, 11, 12 and Atlas). It introduces many of the 
aspects relevant to the generation of regional climate information that are dealt with in detail elsewhere. 
Figure 10.4 summarizes how these chapters relate to one another and to the rest of the report. 
 
Chapter 11 assesses observed, attributed and projected changes in weather and climate extremes, provides a 
mechanistic understanding on how changes in extremes are related to human-induced climate change and 
provides regional, continental and global-scale assessments on changes in extremes, including compound 
events. Chapter 12 identifies elements of the climate system relevant for sectoral impacts referred to as 
climatic impact-drivers (CIDs), assesses past and future evolutions of sector-relevant CIDs for each AR6 
region, synthesizes such evolutions for different time periods and by GWL, and assesses how CIDs are used 
in climate services. The Atlas assesses observed, attributed and projected changes in mean climate, performs 
a comparison of CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX simulations, evaluates downscaling performance and 
assesses approaches to communicate climate information. The Interactive Atlas facilitates the exploration of 
datasets assessed in all chapters through a wide range of maps, graphs and tables generated in an interactive 
manner. This allows for the comparison of changes at warming levels and scenario/time-period 
combinations, display of indices for extremes and CIDs, and serves all chapters in the report to facilitate 
synthesis information and support the Technical Summary and the Summary for Policymakers. 
 
Other chapters also include a strong regional component and provide context for the assessment of regional 
climate. Chapter 1 introduces the different types of climatic regions used in WGI AR6 and the main types of 
climatic models. Chapter 2 describes the recent and current state of the climate from observations, most of 
which are key for the production of regional information. Chapter 3 assesses human influences on the 
climate system and Chapter 4 assesses climate-change projections, with a global focus. These three chapters 
include phenomena that are important for shaping regional climate such as general circulation, jets, storm 
tracks, blocking and modes of variability. At the same time, the visualization of information in global maps 
in these chapters provides valuable information for the sub-continental scale. Chapter 5 assesses the 
knowledge about the carbon and biogoechemical cycles, whose fluxes and responses show variability that is 
strongly regional in nature. Chapter 6 assesses the regional evolution of short-lived climate forcers as well as 
their influence on regional climate and air quality. Chapter 8 assesses observed and projected changes in the 
variability of the regional water cycle, including monsoons, while changes of the regional oceans, changes in 
cryosphere and regional sea level change are assessed in Chapter 9.

# 10.2  Using Observations for Constructing Regional Climate Information 
 
Considerable challenges (and opportunities) remain in using observations for climate monitoring, for 
evaluating and improving climate models (Section 10.3.1), for constructing reanalyses and post-processing 
model outputs, and therefore, ultimately, for increasing our confidence in the attribution of past climate 
changes and in future climate projections at the regional scale. While an assessment of large-scale 
observations can be found in Chapter 2 (Cross-Chapter-Box 2.2, Section 2.3), this section discusses the 
specific aspects of the observations at regional scale and over the typological regions considered in the 
regional chapters (Section 10.1.5). This section focuses on land regions and does not consider the specific 
requirements of ocean observations (see Chapter 9 and the SROCC for more information on this aspect).  
 
## 10.2.1  Observation Types and Their Use at Regional Scale 
 
### 10.2.1.1  In situ and remote-sensing data 
 
Surface or in situ observations can come from a variety of networks: climate reference networks, mesoscale 
weather and supersite observation networks, citizen science networks, among others, all with their strengths 
and weaknesses (McPherson, 2013; Thorne et al., 2018). Supersite observatories are surface and atmospheric 
boundary layer observing networks that measure a large number of atmospheric and soil variables at least 
hourly over a decade or more, ideally located in rural areas (Ackerman and Stokes, 2003; Haeffelin et al., 
2005; Xie et al., 2010; Chiriaco et al., 2018). Adequate calibration of instruments, quality control and 
homogenization are essential in these sites. They produce valuable data needed to diagnose processes and 
changes in regional and local climate. Several climate datasets have been developed from in situ station 
observations, at different spatial scales and temporal frequencies (Annex I). These include sub-daily 
(Dumitrescu et al., 2016; Blenkinsop et al., 2017), daily (Aalto et al., 2016; Funk et al., 2015; Beck et al., 
2017a, 2017b; Camera et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2008; Journée et al., 2015; Schneider et al., 2017), or 
monthly time scales (Aryee et al., 2018; Cuervo-Robayo et al., 2014). Sub-daily data is useful for estimating 
storm surge (Mori et al., 2014) or river discharge (Shrestha et al., 2015), daily data for carbon-stock 
dynamics (Haga et al., 2020) or tourism (Watanabe et al., 2018), and monthly data for beach morphology 
(Bennett et al., 2019). 
 
Satellite products provide a valuable complement to in situ measurements, particularly over regions where in 
situ measurements are unavailable. They have been discussed in earlier chapters (e.g., Chapters 2 and 8) for 
large-scale assessment. Currently 54 essential climate variables (ECVs; Bojinski et al., 2014) are defined by 
the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) program, and passed on, for example, to NASA programmes 
through the Decadal Survey, to the Copernicus Climate Change Service of the European Union, to the ESA 
Climate Change Initiative ESA-CCI, as well as to the international collaborations with geostationary Earth-
orbit (GEO) satellites. Their observations are valuable (high confidence) for regional applications since they 
provide multi-channel images at very high spatiotemporal resolutions, typically 16 channels, 1–2 km, every 
10 to 15 minutes. The advanced geostationary satellites are: Himawari-8 and 9 (Kurihara et al., 2016), 
GOES-East and GOES-17 (Goodman et al., 2018), Meteosat-10 and 11 (Schmetz et al., 2002) and FY-4 
(Cao et al., 2014). Geostationary satellite networks or constellations form an essential component of the 
Global Observation System (https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/OSY/GOS.html), providing 
measurements not only for various cloud properties and moisture but also for air quality, land and ocean 
surface conditions, and lightning. 
 
Low Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites, with orbits typically at 400-700 km, provide advanced measurements of 
the Earth’s surface. Sun-synchronous polar orbiters can also cover the polar regions, which cannot be 
observed with GEO satellites. Examples of LEO observations for land-surface monitoring are NASA’s 
Landsat (Wulder et al., 2016), ESA’s Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity Earth Explorer (SMOS) mission (Kerr et 
al., 2012), the Sentinel missions of the Copernicus programme, and JAXA’s ALOS-2 (Ohki et al., 2019), 
providing high spatial resolution land-surface images. Many kinds of data are accumulated for land use and 
land cover studies, targeting aspects like urban footprint (Florczyk et al., 2019), land-cover data (Global 
Land 30; CCI-LC: https://www.esa-landcover-cci.org; Chen and Chen,2018), land-surface temperature data 
(LANDSAT, Parastatidis et al., 2017), and surface albedo (Chrysoulakis et al., 2019). 
 
Availability of active sensors on LEO satellites enables measurement of microphysical properties of aerosol, 
cloud and precipitation, which can advance regional climate studies and process evaluation studies to 
improve regional climate models (high confidence). An example is the polar-orbiting “afternoon-train” 
satellite constellation (known as the A-train), incorporating Aqua, CALIPSO, Cloudsat, PARASOL, Glory 
and Aura satellites. Vertical profiling observations from Cloudsat (with a W-band cloud radar) and 
CALIPSO (with a cloud lidar) led to considerable advances in measurements of cloud microphysics 
(Stephens et al., 2018). Precipitation and its extremes are essential concerns of regional climate studies. The 
GPM (65°N–65°S, 2014–present) and the preceding TRMM (36.5°N–36.5°S, 1997–2015) with Ku-/Ka-band 
precipitation radars have provided three-dimensional measurements of precipitation with ~5 km resolution 
and sub-daily sampling  (Skofronick-Jackson et al., 2017). Their non-sun synchronous observation works to 
cross-calibrate the constellation satellites to produce global high-resolution mapped products of precipitation, 
such as Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG; Huffman et al., 2007) and the Global 
Satellite Mapping of Precipitation ( GSMaP; Kubota et al., 2007), with hourly sampling at ~11 km 
resolution. The CPC MORPHing technique (CMORPH) has provided 30 min interval global precipitation 
with ~8 km coverage since 2002 (Joyce et al., 2004). Precipitation estimations from Remotely Sensed 
Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) is a sub-daily to daily rainfall product that 
covers 50°S to 50°N globally with 25 km resolution from 2000 to the present (Nguyen et al., 2019), and is 
used for semi-global scale precipitation coverage (Benestad, 2018). TRMM/GPM observations have enabled 
estimates to be obtained for global four-dimensional convective heating (Shige et al., 2009; Tao et al., 2016; 
Takayabu and Tao, 2020). 
 
The use of these data has enhanced our understanding of precipitation processes at regional scale (high 
confidence), such as diurnal cycles in a large river valley (Chen et al., 2012b), and in coastal (Hassim et al., 
2016; Yokoi et al., 2017) and mountainous regions (Hirose et al., 2017). Three-dimensional observations 
revealed the contrasts in regional characteristics of rainfall extremes in monsoon regions and continental dry 
regions (Sohn et al., 2013; Hamada and Takayabu, 2018). Satellite measurements are also used to evaluate 
climate model performance, as well as to develop new parameterizations. As a demonstration of the utility of 
these products in studying model bias, a subtropical cumulus congestus regime has been identified that may 
be implicated in the unrealistic double ITCZ found in some climate models (Takayabu et al., 2010; Hirota et 
al., 2011, 2014). Another example is a parameterization of a land-surface model that was developed 
specifically for a certain soil type. By assimilating satellite brightness temperature observations with their 
LDAS-UT scheme, Yang et al., (2007) successfully optimized a land-surface model for the Tibetan Plateau. 
 
For application at a regional scale, it is important to consider variations in the spatiotemporal resolution of 
the satellite products. A simple concatenation of data in time can show artificial jumps that are artefacts of 
changes in calibration and processing algorithms, or related to satellite orbital stability or changing 
performance of the instruments (Wielicki et al., 2013; Barrett et al., 2014). Recalibration and cross-
calibration are then prerequisites for obtaining homogeneous time series of measurements across different or 
successive satellites that can then be used to produce long series that are valid as climate data records 
(Kanemaru et al., 2017; Merchant et al., 2017). Scale representativeness is also an issue in utilizing soil 
observations (Taylor et al., 2012, 2013). Although a variety of technologies to measure soil moisture at the 
point scale exist (Dobriyal et al., 2012), its spatial representativeness is less than 1 m2 (Ochsner et al., 2013; 
Liu et al., 2016b). Therefore, to be able to use in situ soil moisture for validating coarser-scale data from 
satellites or models, networks of point-scale measurements are used (Crow et al., 2015; Polcher et al., 2016). 
Smaller networks are typically of the size of a single climate model grid cell or a satellite pixel and are 
suitable for monitoring watersheds, while small numbers of those representing larger areas (>100 km2) are 
emerging (Ochsner et al., 2013). 
 
### 10.2.1.2  Derived products 
 
Derived observational products are created from raw datasets collected from surface stations, remote-sensing 
instruments, or research vessels, which are converted into meaningful physical quantities by applying a 
suitable measurement theory, using either statistical interpolation techniques (Section 10.2.2.4) or numerical 
atmospheric and land-surface models (Bosilovich et al., 2015). 
 
Most global observational datasets are available at coarse temporal and spatial resolution, and do not include 
all available station data from a particular region, due to data availability problems. Therefore, efforts have 
been made to develop regional or country-scale datasets (Annex I). Radar and satellite remote sensing are 
resources that can provide a valuable complement to direct measurements at regional scale. Examples for 
precipitation have been described already, some of which have been released to the community (Bližňák et 
al., 2018; Dietzsch et al., 2017; Dinku et al., 2014; Krähenmann et al., 2018; Manz et al., 2016; Oyler et al., 
2015; Panziera et al., 2018; Shen et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2017). However, some of these datasets are limited 
by their short record, varying between one (Shen et al., 2018) and 64 years (Oyler et al., 2015). 
 
Reanalysis products are numerical climate simulations that use data assimilation to incorporate as many 
irregular observations as possible. These products encompass many physical and dynamical processes. They 
generate a coherent estimate of the state of the climate system on uniform grids either at global (Balsamo et 
al., 2015; Chaudhuri et al., 2013), regional (Chaney et al., 2014; Dahlgren et al., 2016; Maidment et al., 
2014; Mahmood et al., 2018; Attada et al., 2018; Langodan et al., 2017) or country scales (Krähenmann et 
al., 2018; Mahmood et al., 2018; Rostkier-Edelstein et al., 2014). 
 
Reanalyses incorporate an increasing volume of observations from a growing number of sources over time, 
which sometimes presents a difficulty for trend analysis. However, regional reanalyses are valuable for 
regional climate assessments, since they can employ high-resolution model simulations due to their limited 
spatial domain. Their accuracy is also better than global reanalyses since they are often developed over 
regions with a high density of observational data (sometimes not freely available for all regions) to be 
assimilated into the model (e.g., Yamada et al., 2012). Regional reanalyses can assimilate locally dense and 
high-frequency observations, such as from local observation networks (Mahmood et al., 2018; Su et al., 
2019) and radar precipitation (Wahl et al., 2017) in addition to the observations assimilated by global 
reanalyses. In some regional reanalyses, satellite-derived high-resolution sea ice (Bromwich et al., 2016, 
2018) and sea surface temperature (Su et al., 2019) are also applied as lower boundary conditions. The 
periods of regional reanalyses are limited by the availability of the observations for assimilation and by the 
global reanalyses needed as lateral boundary conditions. Most regional reanalyses cover the past 10 to 30 
years. There are also regional reanalysis activities that use conventional observations only, which produce 
consistent datasets over 60 years to capture precipitation trends, extremes and changes (Fukui et al., 2018). 
Existing regional reanalyses cover North America (Mesinger et al., 2006), Europe (Dahlgren et al., 2016; 
Jermey and Renshaw, 2016; Kaspar et al., 2020), the Arctic (Bromwich et al., 2016, 2018), South Asia 
(Mahmood et al., 2018), and Australia (Su et al., 2019). A project for regional reanalysis covering Japan has 
also started (Fukui et al., 2018), where grid spacing is between 5 and 32 km, although cumulus 
parameterizations are still needed to compute sub-grid scale cumulus convection. Recently, reanalyses using 
convection-permitting regional models have been published (e.g., Wahl et al., 2017, for central Europe). 
 
The data assimilation schemes used in regional reanalyses are often relatively simple methods, specifically 
nudging (Kaspar et al., 2020) and 3DVAR (Mesinger et al., 2006; Bromwich et al., 2016; Dahlgren et al., 
2016), rather than the more complex schemes implemented in state-of-the-art global reanalysis systems. This 
is partly due to limitations of computational resources. Recently, a number of regional reanalyses using more 
sophisticated methods, such as 4DVAR and Ensemble Kalman filter, have been published (Jermey and 
Renshaw, 2016; Fukui et al., 2018; Mahmood et al., 2018; Su et al., 2019). The regional reanalyses also 
incorporate uncertainties due to deficiencies of the models, data assimilation schemes and observations. To 
estimate uncertainties, some regional reanalyses apply data assimilation using ensemble forecasts (Bach et 
al., 2016). Another approach compares multiple regional reanalyses produced with different systems 
covering the same domain, which represents the uncertainties better than single reanalysis systems with 
ensemble data assimilation schemes (Kaiser-Weiss et al., 2019). 
 
The regional reanalyses represent the frequencies of extremes and the distributions of precipitation, surface 
air temperature, and surface wind better than global reanalyses (high confidence). This is due to the use of 
high-resolution regional climate models (RCMs), as indicated by different regional climate modelling studies 
(Mesinger et al., 2006; Bollmeyer et al., 2015; Bromwich et al., 2016, 2018; Dahlgren et al., 2016; Jermey 
and Renshaw, 2016; Fukui et al., 2018; Su et al., 2019). Regional reanalyses, however, retain uncertainties 
due to deficiencies in the physical parametrization used in RCMs and by the use of relatively simple data 
assimilation algorithms (Bromwich et al., 2016; Jermey and Renshaw, 2016; Su et al., 2019). Regional 
reanalyses can provide estimates that are more consistent with observations than dynamical downscaling 
approaches, due to the assimilation of additional local observations (high confidence) (Bollmeyer et al., 
2015; Fukui et al., 2018). 
 
 
## 10.2.2  Challenges for Regional Climate Change Assessment 
 
### 10.2.2.1  Quality control 
 
The usefulness of any observational dataset is conditioned by the availability and outcome of a quality 
control (QC) process. The objective of the QC is to verify that data are representative of the measured 
variable and to what degree the value could be contaminated by unrelated or conflicting factors (WMO, 
2017a). Data quality assessment is key for ensuring that the data are credible and to establish trusted 
relationships between the data provider and the users (Nightingale et al., 2019). QC is performed for all 
relevant global climate datasets (e.g., Menne et al., 2018). For instance, QC informs users that old reanalysis 
datasets can be inconsistent in the long term because they assimilated inhomogeneous observations over the 
reanalyses period (Kobayashi et al., 2015). As a consequence, the evaluation against independent 
observations suggests that reanalyses should not be automatically regarded as climate-quality products for 
monitoring long-term trends at the regional level (Manzanas et al., 2014; Torralba et al., 2017). QC needs to 
be systematically carried out by the institutions responsible for handling the data (e.g. Cao et al., 2016). 
 
The QC procedure depends strongly on the specific nature of the dataset. It focuses on aspects such as the 
correct identification of sensor, time and location, detection of unfeasible or inconsistent data, error 
estimation, assessment of the adequacy of the uncertainty information and the adequacy of the 
documentation (e.g., Heaney et al., 2016). QC principles also apply to model data (Tapiador et al., 2017). An 
important piece of information provided is the representativeness error (Section 10.2.1.1; Gervais et al., 
2014). When problems in the data representativeness are identified, observational datasets are provided with 
a quality mask (Contractor et al., 2020), or the problematic data are either removed or corrected (Ashcroft et 
al., 2018). These are factors often taken into account in constructing regional climate information (Kotlarski 
et al., 2019). 
 
Quality-controlled data are now produced widely at the regional level, as in the case of sub-daily 
precipitation records in the United Kingdom (Blenkinsop et al., 2017) and the USA (Nelson et al., 2016). 
However, many more datasets and variables lack the same level of scrutiny (Alexander, 2016). Quality-
controlled, high-resolution observational datasets are especially needed at regional and local scales to assess 
models as their resolution increases (Di Luca et al., 2016; Zittis and Hadjinicolaou, 2017), although the 
awareness and appropriate use of the QC information is challenging (Tapiador et al., 2017) when generating 
regional climate information (high confidence). 
 
 
### 10.2.2.2  Homogenization  
 
Homogenization aims to make data spatially and temporally “homogeneous”. Changes in a homogeneous 
time series are solely due to large-scale climatic changes (whether forced or due to internal variability). 
Station data are influenced by factors that act at regional scales, from the mesoscale and local scale down to 
the microscale (WMO, 2019). Station time series contain inhomogeneities such as artificial jumps or trends, 
which hamper assessments of regional long-term trends. Typical reasons for this are the urbanization of a 
station’s surroundings, which can lead to warming (Hamdi, 2010; Hansen et al., 2010; Adachi et al., 2012; 
Jones, 2016; Sun et al., 2016b), or relocations outside of the urban area, which could lead to cooling 
(Tuomenvirta, 2001; Yan et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2013; Dienst et al., 2017, 2019). Another potential source of 
inhomogeneity is a change in measurement methods that affect most instruments of an observational network 
over a limited time span, such as the transition to Stevenson screens (Parker, 1994; Böhm et al., 2010; Brunet 
et al., 2011; Auchmann and Brönnimann, 2012) or to automatic weather stations (WMO, 2017b). 
 
The above examples have been selected as they are present in many stations and without going through 
homogenization they could potentially have influenced global land warming estimates (Section 1.5.1). 
Single-break inhomogeneities tend to have a magnitude comparable to global climate change (Tuomenvirta, 
2001; Venema et al., 2012) and are thus important for analyses of small regions. Also station records in 
national networks often have similar changes, making them important for national climate change estimates, 
but many of these influences are averaged out at the global scale (Jones, 2016). 
 
The main approach to reduce the influence of inhomogeneities in station observations is statistical 
homogenization by comparing the data from a candidate station with those of neighbouring reference 
stations in conjunction with the use of metadata (Trewin, 2010). This is a challenging task because both 
reference and candidate records normally have multiple inhomogeneities. Three challenges should be 
considered. First, most of our understanding of statistical homogenization stems from the homogenization of 
temperature observations from dense networks. Recent studies suggest that our ability to remove biases 
quickly diminishes for sparse networks (Gubler et al., 2017; Lindau and Venema, 2018a). This affects early 
instrumental data and observations that are not strongly correlated between stations, such as wind and 
humidity (Chimani et al., 2018). 
 
Second, in addition to systematic errors, homogenized data also suffer from random errors, introduced by the 
homogenization process. These errors are largest at the station level but are also present in network-averaged 
signals (Lindau and Venema, 2018b). These errors are determined by the break time series, as well as the 
noise series and the performance of the homogenization method, are spatially correlated, and have an impact 
on activities such as interpolation and statistical post-processing of climate simulations (Section 10.2.3.1). 
Third, the above discussion pertains to the homogenization of monthly and annual means. Homogenization 
of daily variability around the mean is more difficult. For daily data, specific correction methods are used 
(Della-Marta and Wanner, 2006; Mestre et al., 2011; Trewin, 2013) that are able to improve the homogeneity 
of test cases, although recent independent validation efforts were not able to show much improvement 
(Chimani et al., 2018). The difference with homogenization methods of monthly and annual means may stem 
from assumptions on the nature of inhomogeneities for daily data, which are not yet well understood 
(Chimani et al., 2018). 
 
It is virtually certain that statistical homogenization methods reduce the uncertainties of long-term estimates. 
Considering a decomposition of the long-term warming error into a bias and a noise uncertainty around the 
bias, the (trend) bias especially will be reduced, but also most of the noise uncertainty. This conclusion is 
based on our understanding of the causes of inhomogeneities and their statistical nature combined with the 
design principles of statistical homogenization methods, as well as on analytical (Lindau and Venema, 
2018b), numerical (Venema et al., 2012; Williams et al., 2012) and empirical validation studies (Hausfather 
et al., 2016; Gubler et al., 2017; Killick et al., 2020). 
 
The above section is about the homogenization of land stations. Satellite data has its own issues and methods 
for homogenization (Brinckmann et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2015; Brogniez et al., 2016). The 
homogenization of radiosonde data and land station data use similar methods (Haimberger et al., 2012; 
Jovanovic et al., 2017). 
 
 
### 10.2.2.3  Data scarcity 
 
Data scarcity arises largely due to the lack of maintenance of observing stations, inaccessibility of the data 
held in national networks, and uneven spatial distribution of stations that lead to a low density in many 
regions. This is particularly problematic when trying to assess regional climate change, for which a high 
density of observational data is desirable. Although in several regions numerous stations provide (monthly) 
data covering more than 100 years for both temperature and precipitation (GCOS, 2015), large areas of the 
world remain sparsely covered. The post-1990 decline in the total number of stations contributing to the 
Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) monthly product may be related to delays in data 
acquisition and not paucity of data (GCOS, 2015). This is because GPCC is the result of a single time scale, 
single Essential Climate Variable and single data collection centre. There is no similar drop-off of the 
rainfall reports in the Global Historical Climatology Network - Daily database (GHCND, Menne et al., 2012) 
or the Integrated Surface Database at the sub-daily time scale.  
 
Kidd et al. (2017) made some assumptions about GPCC-available gauges and indicated that only 1.6% of 
Earth’s surface lies within 10 km of a rain gauge, and many areas of the world are beyond 100 km from the 
nearest rain gauge. Data scarcity is especially critical over Africa (Nikulin et al. 2012, Dike et al., 2018) but 
the apparent data scarcity could be due to reasons other than actual paucity of data, as stated earlier. For 
instance, over South Africa, the number of weather stations collecting daily temperature used in the fourth 
version of the Climatic Research Unit Temperature dataset (CRUTEM4, Osborn and Jones, 2014) has 
significantly declined since 1980 (Archer et al., 2018). Although CRUTEM4 has now been replaced by 
CRUTEM5 (Osborn et al., 2021) it has yet to take advantage of the significant international efforts to curate 
and make available improved global holdings (Rennie et al., 2014) which increased the global available 
station count for monthly mean temperatures. This includes additional stations from many African countries. 
The apparent decline in stations since the 1980s could also be due to countries not contributing their data to 
the SYNOP/CLIMAT networks for reasons other than having non-operational stations. 
 
Even in Europe, precipitation station density in the widely used E-OBS gridded dataset varies largely in 
space and time across regions (Prein and Gobiet, 2017). This variability is partly due to the reluctance of 
some data owners to share their data with an international effort. Regardless of the reason, low station 
density is a major source of uncertainty (Isotta et al., 2015). Kirchengast et al. (2014) and O and Foelsche 
(2018) found that at least 2 to 5 (12) stations are required for capturing the area-averaged precipitation 
amount of heavy summertime precipitation events on a daily (hourly) basis with a normalised root-mean-
square error of less than 20%. Similar to the E-OBS dataset, gridded daily temperature and precipitation 
datasets are being developed for other regions of the world. Examples include Southeast Asia (SA-OBS, Van 
den Besselaar et al., 2017), and West Africa (WACA&D, Van Den Besselaar et al., 2015). Despite the 
uneven distribution of stations in space and time, the value in these initiatives is illustrated by the large 
number of studies in which the data product is used. This is the case, for instance, the work of Condom et al., 
(2020) over the Andes, a region with prominent data scarcity, and the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary 
Analysis Project over West Africa (e.g., Lebel and Ali, 2009). There have been efforts to reduce data scarcity 
through initiatives such as the International Surface Temperature Initiative (ISTI, Thorne et al., 2011), 
GHCND, and the Expanding Met Office Hadley Centre ISD with quality-controlled, sub-daily station data 
from 1931 (HadISD, Dunn et al., 2016). 
 
Data scarcity arising from changing coverage in observation station networks results in substantial problems 
for climate monitoring (e.g., trend analysis of extreme events requires high temporal and spatial resolutions) 
or model evaluation (Section 10.3.3.1). It is virtually certain that the scarcity and decline of observational 
availability in some regions (but not necessarily globally), increase the uncertainty of the long-term global 
temperature and precipitation estimates. As an example, Lin and Huybers (2019) found that changes in the 
number of rain gauges after 1975 resulted in spurious trends in extremes of Indian rainfall in a 0.25°-gridded 
dataset spanning the 20th century. In fact, the number of stations used to construct the gridded dataset 
dropped by half after 1990, leading to inhomogeneity and spurious trends (Section 10.6.3). Over the southern 
part of the Mediterranean, which is an area sparsely covered by meteorological stations, data scarcity can 
lead to large uncertainties in the different gridded datasets and strongly affect model evaluation (Section 
10.6.4). Perpetual data sparsity results in some climate characteristics not being observed (Yokoyama et al., 
2019). 
 
There are techniques for estimating and reconstructing missing data. The methods depend on the variable of 
interest, the temporal resolution (e.g., daily or monthly), and the type of climate (wet or dry), among others. 
There has been very little evaluation of the performance of classical and data mining methods (e.g., Sattari et 
al., 2017). The classical methods include the arithmetic mean, inverse-distance weighting method, multiple-
regression analysis, multiple imputation, and single-best estimator, while the data-mining methods include 
multiple-perceptron artificial neural network, support-vector machine, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference 
system, gene-expression programming method, and K-nearest neighbour. Crowd-sourced data (individuals 
contribute their own data points to create a dataset for others to use) could play a role in minimizing data 
scarcity (Section 10.2.4). 
 
 
### 10.2.2.4  Gridding 
 
Derived gridded datasets require merging data from different sources of observations and/or reanalysis data 
on a regular grid (e.g., Xie and Arkin, 1997; Section 10.2.1.2). However, in situ observations are distributed 
irregularly, especially over sparsely populated areas. This leads to an interpolation challenge. Gridded 
products of climate variables, including temperature and precipitation, are strongly affected (high 
confidence) by the interpolation method over complex orography and data scarce regions (Hofstra et al., 
2008; Herrera et al., 2016). 
 
There are two main approaches to produce gridded datasets: (1) based on in situ observations only, and (2) 
combining in situ observations with remote-sensing data and/or reanalysis data. The first approach has been 
widely employed in regions with high station density using interpolation techniques (such as inverse-
distance weighting, optimal interpolation, and kriging) (Chen et al., 2008; Haylock et al., 2008; Frei, 2014; 
Isotta et al., 2014; Masson and Frei, 2014; Hiebl and Frei, 2016; Inoue et al., 2016). The second approach 
has been mainly applied in data-sparse regions with low station density, using simple bias adjustment, 
quantile mapping, and kriging techniques with in situ observations, remote-sensing and reanalysis data 
(Cheema and Bastiaanssen, 2012; Dinku et al., 2014; Abera et al., 2016; Erdin et al., 2012; Krähenmann et 
al., 2018). 
 
Gridding of station data is affected by uncertainties stemming from measurement errors, inhomogeneities, 
the distribution of the underlying stations and the interpolation error, with station density being the dominant 
factor (Herrera et al., 2019). Uncertainty due to interpolation is typically small for temperature but 
substantial for precipitation and its derivatives, such as drought indices (Chubb et al., 2015; Hellwig et al., 
2018). The largest uncertainties typically occur in sparsely sampled mountain areas (Section 10.2.2.5). 
Interpolation generally give rise to smoothing effects, such as low variability of the derived dataset with 
respect to the in situ observations (Chen et al., 2019). As a result, the effective resolution of gridded data is 
typically much lower than its nominal resolution. For instance, a 5 km gridded precipitation dataset for the 
European Alps has an effective resolution of about 10 to 25 km (Isotta et al., 2014). In an example for 
precipitation in Spain, the effective resolution converged to the nominal resolution only when at least 6 to 7 
stations were inside the grid cell (Herrera et al., 2019). To account for the smoothing errors, new stochastic 
ensemble observation datasets have been introduced (Von Clarmann, 2014). 
 
 
### 10.2.2.5  Observations in mountain areas 
 
Spatiotemporal variability of meteorological parameters observed over mountainous areas is often large, 
indicating strong control exerted by local topography on meteorological parameters (Gultepe et al., 2014). 
Difficult access, harsh climatic conditions as well as instrumental issues make meteorological measurements 
extremely challenging at higher elevations (Azam et al., 2018; Beniston et al., 2018). Measurements of wind 
speed, temperature, relative humidity and radiative fluxes are critical for climate model evaluation, but 
difficult to handle due to their point-scale representativeness and small-scale spatiotemporal variability over 
mountainous terrain, and often need adjustment (Gultepe, 2015). High-altitude (>3000 metres) permanent 
meteorological stations are limited and current knowledge is mainly based on valley-bottom or low-elevation 
meteorological stations (Qin et al., 2009; Lawrimore et al., 2011; Gultepe, 2015; Condom et al., 2020), 
which, generally do not represent the higher elevation climate (Immerzeel et al., 2015; Shea et al., 2015). 
 
Measuring precipitation amounts, especially of solid precipitation, in mountainous areas is particularly 
challenging due to the presence of orographic barriers, strong vertical and horizontal precipitation rate 
variability, and the difficulty in finding representative sites for precipitation measurements (Barry, 2012). 
However, the precipitation amounts can be indirectly estimated by the observed point mass balances at 
glacier accumulation areas representing net snow accumulation (Haimberger et al., 2012; Immerzeel et al., 
2015; Sakai et al., 2015; Azam et al., 2018). There is very high confidence that precipitation measurements, 
especially solid precipitation, in mountainous areas are strongly affected by the gauge location and setup. 
Precipitation measurements are also affected by the type of measurement method, presence/absence of 
shielding, presence/absence of a heating system and operating meteorological conditions (Nitu et al., 2018). 
Solid precipitation measurements may have errors ranging from 20% to 50%, largely due to under-catch in 
windy, icing and riming conditions (Rasmussen et al., 2012), and therefore require corrections by applying 
transfer functions developed mainly from collected wind speed and temperature data (Kochendorfer et al., 
2017). The latest Solid Precipitation Intercomparison Experiment report recommends measurements of wind 
speed, wind direction and temperature as the minimum standard ancillary data for solid precipitation 
monitoring (Nitu et al., 2018). 
 
Recent advancements through remote-sensing methods provide an alternative, but they also have limitations 
over mountainous areas. Different versions of TRMM products were found to perform differently over 
mountainous areas (Zulkafli et al., 2014). Orographic heavy rainfall associated with Typhoon Morakot in 
2009 was severely underestimated in all microwave products including TRMM 3B42 (Shige et al., 2013). 
The underestimation has been mitigated in the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) product 
by considering the orographic effects (Shige et al., 2013). Studies have suggested a high accuracy of passive 
optical satellite (e.g., MODIS, Landsat) snow products under clear skies when compared with the field 
observations. However, cloud masking and sub-pixel cloud heterogeneity in these snow-cover products 
considerably restrict their applications (Kahn et al., 2011; Brun et al., 2015; Tang et al., 2017; Stillinger et 
al., 2019). Gridded datasets (e.g., CRU, GPCC Full Data Product, GPCC Monitoring Product, ERA-Interim, 
ERA5, ERA5-land, MERRA-2, MERRA-2 bias adjusted, PERSIANN-CDR) are of paramount importance, 
yet they often lack enough in situ observations to improve the temporal and spatial distribution of 
meteorological parameters over complex mountain terrain (Zandler et al., 2019). 
 
 
### 10.2.2.6  Structural uncertainty  
 
Beyond climate monitoring, the quality and availability of multiple observational reference datasets play a 
central role in model evaluation. In fact, when using observations for model evaluation, there are multiple 
examples where inter-observational uncertainty is as large as the inter-model variability. This has been 
shown for various aspects of the Indian monsoon (Section 10.6.3) (Collins et al., 2013a) and for precipitation 
uncertainties over Africa (Section 10.6.4) (Nikulin et al., 2012; Sylla et al., 2013; Dosio et al., 2015; Bador et 
al., 2020) and Europe (Prein and Gobiet, 2017). Kotlarski et al. (2019) compared three high-resolution 
observational temperature and precipitation datasets (E-OBS, a compilation of national/regional high-
resolution gridded datasets, and the EURO4M-MESAN 0.22° reanalysis based on a high-resolution limited-
area model) with five EURO-CORDEX RCMs driven by ERA-Interim. Generally, the differences between 
RCMs are larger than those between observation datasets, but for individual regions and performance 
metrics, observational uncertainty can dominate. They also showed that the choice of reference dataset can 
have an influence on the RCM performance score. Over the high mountain Asia region and East Asia, 
differences among gridded precipitation datasets can generate significant uncertainties in deriving 
precipitation characteristics (Kim et al., 2015b; Kim and Park, 2016; Guo et al., 2017). Over western North 
America, observational uncertainty induces differences in multi-decadal precipitation trends (Lehner et al., 
2018). Taking a very different perspective, the agreement between model simulations may be used to 
estimate the uncertainty and quality of observations (Massonnet et al., 2016). There is high confidence that 
an ensemble of multiple observational references at a regional scale is fundamental for model performance 
assessment. The uncertainties vary according to region, season, and statistical properties (Cross-Chapter Box 
10.2). 
 
## 10.2.3  Other Uses of Observations at Regional Scale 
 
### 10.2.3.1  Observations for calibrating statistical methods 
 
Statistical downscaling, bias adjustment and weather generators are post-processing methods used to derive 
climate information from climate simulations. They all require observational data for calibration as well as 
evaluation (Section 10.3.3.1). Typically, the so-called perfect prognosis methods use quasi-observations for 
the predictors (i.e., reanalyses) and actual observations for the predictands (the surface variables of interest). 
By contrast, bias adjustment methods use observations only for the predictands. Weather generators typically 
require only observed predictands, although some are conditioned on observed predictors as well. Very often 
these methods are based on daily data, because of user needs, but also because of the limited availability of 
sub-daily observations and the limited ability of climate models to realistically simulate sub-daily weather 
(Iizumi et al., 2012). Some methods are calibrated on the monthly scale, but some of the generated time 
series are then further disaggregated to the daily scale (e.g., Thober et al., 2014). A few methods, mainly 
weather generators, represent sub-daily weather (Mezghani and Hingray, 2009; Kaczmarska et al., 2014). 
Many methods simulate temperature and precipitation only, although some also represent wind, radiation 
and other variables. The limited availability of high quality and long observational records typically restricts 
these applications to a few cases (Verfaillie et al., 2017; Pryor and Hahmann, 2019). Overall, there is high 
confidence that limited availability of station observations, including variables beyond temperature and 
precipitation as well as sub-daily data, limit the use of statistical modelling of regional climate. 
 
All the limitations and challenges of observational data discussed in Section 10.2.2 also apply to its use for 
post-processing of climate model data. High quality and long observational data series are particularly 
relevant to quantify uncertainties. Different reanalyses present significant discrepancies when used as key 
predictor variables at the daily scale and may even affect the downscaled climate change signal (Brands et 
al., 2012; Dayon et al., 2015; Manzanas et al., 2015; Horton and Brönnimann, 2019). There is high 
confidence that reanalysis uncertainties limit the quality of statistical downscaling in some regions, although 
no assessment has been made for the most recent reanalysis products. 
 
An important issue for bias adjustment is the correct representation of the required spatial scale. Ideally, bias 
adjustment is calibrated against area-averaged data of the same spatial scale as the climate model output. 
Hence, high-quality observed gridded datasets with an effective resolution close to the nominal model 
resolution are required. Driven by the need to also generate regional-scale information in station-sparse 
regions, researchers have considered derived datasets that blend in situ and remote sensing data to produce 
high-resolution observations to be used as predictands (e.g., Haiden et al., 2011; Wilby and Yu, 2013) 
(Sections 10.2.1.2 and 10.2.2.4). 
 
### 10.2.3.2  Observation for paleoclimate data assimilation 
 
Following some early concept studies, the first practical applications of paleoclimate data assimilation over 
past centuries used only selected data to reconstruct past climate changes for analysis of a specific process or 
case (Widmann et al., 2010). Recently, assimilation of multiple series from various data sources, including 
tree rings, ice cores, lake cores, corals, and bivalves, has allowed production of reconstructions that can be 
widely shared and applied to multiple purposes, as with modern reanalyses (Franke et al., 2017; Hakim et al., 
2016; Steiger et al., 2018, Tardif et al. 2019). Most of these paleo-reanalyses are global but there are 
products using regional models or targeted at specific regions such as Europe, East Africa and the Indian 
Ocean (Fallah et al., 2018; Klein and Goosse, 2018). 
 
Paleo-reanalyses are enabling a new range of applications and have already provided useful information on 
seasonal-to-multidecadal climate variability over past millennia. They are useful tools to study the 
covariance between variables at interannual-to-centennial time scales and at regional to global spatial scales. 
In particular, they have highlighted the processes that can be responsible for changes in continental 
hydrology at multi-decadal time scales (Franke et al., 2017; Klein and Goosse, 2018; Steiger et al., 2018). 
 
Paleo-reanalyses have confirmed a large contribution of internal variability in past changes at regional scale 
during the pre-industrial period, superimposed on a weak common signal due to forcing changes (Goosse et 
al., 2012) and the absence of a globally coherent warm period in the common era before the recent warming 
(Neukom et al., 2019). Reconstructions of the atmospheric state obtained in the reanalysis also provide 
robust evidence of a local enhancement of warming or cooling conditions due to changes in atmospheric 
circulation, such as for the warm conditions in some European regions around 950‒1250 CE, the cooling 
observed in 1809/1810, or the cold and rainy 1816 summer in Europe ( Cross-Chapter Box 4.1; Goosse et al., 
2012; Hakim et al., 2016; Franke et al., 2017; Schurer et al., 2019). 
 
 
## 10.2.4  Outlook for Improving Observational Data for Regional Climates 
 
An encouraging development for understanding climate variations over the past 250 years or so at the global 
and regional scale lies in the field of data rescue, in which hitherto hidden archives of meteorological data 
are brought to the forefront (Sections 1.5.1.1 and 2.5). Surface observations from data rescue projects may 
then be assimilated to derive long-term high-resolution gridded surface regional reanalysis (Devers et al., 
2020). Global extended reanalyses such as 20CR (Compo et al., 2011), ERA-20C (Poli et al., 2016b, 2016a) 
or CERA-20C (Laloyaux et al., 2018) may be further downscaled to quantify the variability of past climate 
at the regional scale (Caillouet et al., 2016, 2019). 
 
One of the main scientific challenges related to high-resolution regional climate modelling is dealing with 
the representation of fine-scale processes (e.g., Yano et al., 2018) in observational data sets. Additionally, 
reliable observation networks following WMO standards have a very sparse geographical representation. 
Hence, regional climate models have started to use high-resolution data combined with crowdsourced 
observations (Zheng et al., 2018). Recent efforts have led to the production of homogeneously processed 
long-term datasets for regional climate model evaluation (Goudenhoofdt and Delobbe, 2016; Humphrey et 
al., 2017; Yang and Ng, 2019). While they are far less reliable and accurate than professional observations, 
crowdsourced data are abundantly available and can give spatial representations at very high resolution. This 
technological trend could prove very useful (high confidence), and the regional climate community is 
making efforts to understand the extent to which these data sources can be exploited, at least as a 
complement to traditional datasets (Overeem et al., 2013; Meier et al., 2017; Uijlenhoet et al., 2018; de Vos 
et al., 2019; Langendijk et al., 2019a). 
 
 
# 10.3  Using Models for Constructing Regional Climate Information 
 
Much of the information available on future regional climate arises from studies based on climate model 
simulations (Chapters 3, 4 and 8). In this section, different types of models (Section 10.3.1) and model 
experiments (Section 10.3.2) for generating regional climate information are discussed, followed by an 
assessment of the performance, added value, and fitness-for-purpose of different model types (Section 
10.3.3). The focus is on the representation of large- to local-scale phenomena and processes relevant for 
regional climate. Finally, uncertainties of regional climate projections and methodologies to manage these 
are assessed (Section 10.3.4). 
 
 
## 10.3.1  Model Types 
 
Regional climate change information may be derived from a hierarchy of different model types covering a 
wide range of spatial scales and processes (Figure 10.5). The application of any model relies on assumptions, 
depending on the specific model as well as the application. Table 10.1 gives an overview of the generic 
assumptions of the different model types discussed here for generating regional climate information. The 
violation of these assumptions will affect the model performance, which is discussed in Section 10.3.3.

### 10.3.1.1  Global models, including high-resolution and variable resolution models 
 
Model-based regional climate projections are all based upon some type of global climate model, including 
state-of-the-art Earth system models (ESMs), coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (GCMs) 
or atmosphere-only general circulation models (AGCMs) (see Section 1.5.3.1). They are collectively referred 
to as global models. 
 
State-of-the-art global models are generally used to derive climate information at continental to global scales 
both for past and future climates (e.g., Chapters 3 and 4). The nominal horizontal resolution in CMIP5 global 
models is typically 100–200 km. The effective resolution, for which the shape of the kinetic energy spectrum 
is simulated correctly, is about 3 to 5 times larger (Klaver et al., 2020), and a similar relationship also applies 
to RCMs (Skamarock, 2004). This strongly limits their ability to resolve local details. Since AR5 the 
progress in reducing biases and providing more credible regional projections by global models has been 
moderate in spite of the more realistic representation of a number of processes and the increase in resolution 
of some models. For AR6, several of the new CMIP6 (Eyring et al., 2016a) model intercomparison projects 
(MIPs) address some of these limitations. The list of MIPs is provided in Chapter 1 (Table 1.3). HighResMIP 
(High-Resolution MIP; Haarsma et al., 2016) and GMMIP (Global Monsoons MIP; Zhou et al., 2016)) 
specifically address the regional climate challenge using global models. HighResMIP focuses on producing 
global climate projections at a horizontal resolution of around 50 km grid spacing or finer while GMMIP 
aims at better understanding and predicting the monsoons. 
 
An alternative to increasing resolution everywhere is offered by variable resolution global models, that is, 
with regionally finer resolution. They have been developed since the 1970s (Li, 1999), resulting in a first 
coordinated effort (SGMIP) by Fox-Rabinovitz et al., (2006, 2008). They are expected to offer the finest 
resolution possible in the region of interest, while still resolving the climate processes at the global scale 
(although at lower resolution). An overview of recent developments is in McGregor (2015). This is a rapidly 
developing field (Krinner et al., 2014; Ferguson et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2016) that will possibly contribute 
to improved future regional projections. 
 
 
### 10.3.1.2  RCMs 
 
RCMs are dynamical models similar to GCMs that are applied over a limited area, but with a horizontal 
resolution higher than that of standard GCMs. They are the basis for dynamical downscaling to produce sub-
continental climate information (e.g., Chapters 11, 12 and Atlas) but are also often used for process 
understanding. At lateral and, if applicable, lower boundaries, RCMs take their values from a driving data 
set, which could be a GCM or a reanalysis. RCMs are typically one-way nested: they do not feed back into 
the driving model, although two-way nested GCM-RCM simulations have been performed that examine 
regional influence on large-scale climate, potentially improving it (Lorenz and Jacob, 2005; Harris and Lin, 
2013; Junquas et al., 2016). Spectral nudging (Kida et al., 1991; Waldron et al., 1996; von Storch et al., 
2000; Kanamaru and Kanamitsu, 2007) can increase consistency with the driving model, whereby selected 
variables, such as the wind field, are forced to closely follow a prescribed large-scale field over a specified 
range of spatial scales. RCMs can inherit biases from the driving GCM in addition to producing biases 
themselves (Dosio et al., 2015; Hall, 2014; Hong and Kanamitsu, 2014; Takayabu et al., 2016). The 
consistency between the circulation features simulated by the RCM and those inherited through the boundary 
conditions depends on 1) the relative importance of the large-scale forcing compared to local-scale 
phenomena, and 2) the size of the RCM domain (e.g., Diaconescu and Laprise, 2013). Large domains also 
allow the RCM to generate much of its own internally generated unforced variability (Nikiema et al., 2017, 
and references therein; Sanchez-Gomez and Somot, 2018). 
 
The CORDEX initiative (COordinated Regional climate Downscaling EXperiment; Giorgi et al., 2009; 
Giorgi and Gutowski, 2015; Gutowski Jr. et al., 2016) provides ensembles of high-resolution historical 
(starting as early as 1950) and future climate projections for various regions. RCMs in CORDEX typically 
have a horizontal resolution between 10 and 50 km. But much finer spatial resolution is required to fully 
resolve deep convection, an important cause of precipitation in much of the world. Therefore, an emerging 
strand in dynamical downscaling employs simulations at convection permitting scales, at horizontal 
resolutions of a few kilometres, where deep-convection parameterisations can be switched off, 
approximately simulating deep convection (Prein et al., 2015; Stratton et al., 2018; Coppola et al., 2020). A 
recent study indicates that switching off the deep-convection parameterization may be beneficial also in 
simulations performed at coarser resolutions (Vergara-Temprado et al., 2019). Alternatively, some RCMs 
make use of scale-aware parameterizations that are able to adapt to increasing resolution without switching 
off the convection scheme (Hamdi et al., 2012; De Troch et al., 2013; Plant and Yano, 2015; Giot et al., 
2016; Termonia et al., 2018; Yano et al., 2018). 
 
RCMs have often consisted of atmospheric and land components that do not include all possible Earth-
system processes and therefore neglect important processes such as air-sea coupling (in standard RCMs sea 
surface temperatures, SSTs, are prescribed from GCM simulations or reanalyses) or the chemistry of cloud-
aerosol interaction (aerosols prescribed with a climatology), which may influence regional climate 
projections. Therefore, some RCMs have been extended by coupling to additional components like 
interactive oceans, sometimes with sea ice (Kjellström et al., 2005; Somot et al., 2008; Van Pham et al., 
2014; Sein et al., 2015; Ruti et al., 2016; Zou and Zhou, 2016a; Zou et al., 2017; Samanta et al., 2018), rivers 
(Sevault et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2015; Di Sante et al., 2019), glaciers (Kotlarski et al., 2010), and aerosols 
(Zakey et al., 2006; Zubler et al., 2011; Nabat et al., 2015). The coupling of these components allows for the 
investigation of additional climate processes such as regional sea-level change (Adloff et al., 2018), ocean-
land interactions (Lima et al., 2019; Soares et al., 2019a), or the impact of high-frequency ocean-atmosphere 
coupling on the climatology of Mediterranean cyclones (Flaounas et al., 2018). 
  
 
### 10.3.1.3  Statistical approaches to generate regional climate projections 
 
An alternative or addition to dynamical downscaling is the use of statistical approaches to generate regional 
projections. In AR5 these methods were collectively referred to as statistical downscaling, but their 
performance assessment has received little attention. A major conclusion was that a wide range of different 
methods exist and a general assessment of their performance is difficult (Flato et al., 2014). Since AR5, 
several initiatives have been launched to improve the understanding of statistical approaches such as 
VALUE (now merged into EURO-CORDEX activities; Maraun et al., 2015), STARMIP (Vaittinada Ayar et 
al., 2016) and BADJAM (Galmarini et al., 2019). The performance of different implementations of these 
approaches will be assessed in Section 10.3.3.7. 
 
 
#### 10.3.1.3.1  Perfect prognosis 
Perfect-prognosis models are statistical models calibrated between observation-based large-scale predictors 
(e.g., from reanalysis) and observed local-scale predictands (Maraun and Widmann, 2018b). Regional 
climate projections are then generated by replacing the quasi-observed predictors by those from climate 
model (typically global model) projections. Predictor patterns that are common to observations and climate 
model data can be defined by common empirical orthogonal functions (Benestad, 2011). The perfect 
prognosis approach can either be used to generate daily (or even sub-daily) time series, or local weather 
statistics (e.g., Benestad et al., 2018). 
 
Regression-like models (Maraun and Widmann, 2018b) rely on a transfer function linking an observed local 
statistic (such as the temperature at a given day) to some set of large-scale predictors. Recent developments  
include stochastic regression models to explicitly simulate local variability (San-Martín et al., 2017; those 
explicitly modelling temporal dependence are assessed in Section 10.3.1.3.4). The use of machine learning 
techniques has been reinvigorated, including genetic programming to construct a data-driven model structure 
(Zerenner et al., 2016) and deep and convolutional neural networks (Reichstein et al., 2019; Baño-Medina et 
al., 2020). 
 
Analogue methods (Martin et al., 1996; Maraun and Widmann, 2018b) compare a simulated large-scale 
atmospheric field with an archive of observations and select, using some distance metric, the closest 
observed field in the archive. The downscaled atmospheric field is then chosen as the local atmospheric field 
observed on the instant the analogue occurred. New analogue methods have been developed to simulate 
unobserved values including a rescaling of the analogue (Pierce et al., 2014) or by combining analogues and 
regression models (Chardon et al., 2018). 
 
 
#### 10.3.1.3.2  Bias adjustment 
Bias adjustment is a statistical post-processing technique used to pragmatically reduce the mismatch between 
the statistics of climate model output and observations. The approach estimates the bias or relative error 
between a chosen simulated statistical property (such as the long-term mean or specific quantiles of the 
climatological distribution) and that observed over a calibration period; the simulated statistic is then 
adjusted taking into account the simulated deviation. Bias adjustment methods are regularly applied on a 
spatial scale similar to that of the simulation being adjusted, but they are often used as a simple statistical 
downscaling method by calibrating them between coarse resolution (e.g., global) model output and finer 
observations (Maraun and Widmann, 2018b). 
 
Typical implementations of bias adjustment are (1) additive adjustments, where the model data is adjusted by 
adding a constant, (2) rescaling, where the model data is adjusted by a factor, and (3) more flexible quantile 
mapping approaches that adjust different ranges of a distribution individually. Hempel et al. (2013), Pierce et 
al. (2015), Switanek et al. (2017), and (Lange, 2019) developed variants of quantile mapping that preserve 
trends in the mean or even further distributional statistics. Multivariate bias adjustment extends univariate 
methods, which adjust statistics of individual variables separately, to joint adjustment of multiple variables 
simultaneously. Implementations remove biases in (1) specific measures of multivariate dependence, like 
correlation structure, via linear transformations (Bárdossy and Pegram, 2012; Cannon, 2016), or, more 
flexibly, (2) the full multivariate distribution via nonlinear transformations (Vrac and Friederichs, 2015; 
Dekens et al., 2017; Cannon, 2018; Vrac, 2018; Robin et al., 2019). Other research strands focus on the 
explicit separation of bias adjustment and downscaling (Section 10.3.1.3.5), or the integration of process 
understanding (Maraun et al., 2017), such as by conditioning the adjustment on the occurrence of relevant 
phenomena (Addor et al., 2016; Verfaillie et al., 2017; Manzanas and Gutiérrez, 2019). Some authors 
suggest to mitigate the influence of large-scale temperature or circulation biases by performing a bias 
adjustment of the driving fields prior to dynamical downscaling (Colette et al., 2012; Hernández-Díaz et al., 
2013, 2019). Issues that may arise when using bias adjustment are discussed in Cross-Chapter Box 10.2. 
 
 
#### 10.3.1.3.3  Delta-change approaches 
In the delta change approach, selected observations are modified according to corresponding changes derived 
from dynamical model simulations. Traditionally, only long term means have been adjusted, but recently 
approaches to modify temporal dependence (Webber et al., 2018) have been developed, as well as quantile 
mapping approaches that individually adjust quantiles of the observed distribution (Willems and Vrac, 
2011). By construction, the approach cannot modify the spatial and temporal dependence structure of the 
input observations (Maraun, 2016). 
 
 
#### 10.3.1.3.4  Weather generators 
Weather generators are statistical models that simulate weather time series of arbitrary length. They are 
calibrated to represent observed weather statistics, in particular daily or even sub-daily variability. One 
variant of these models are advanced stochastic perfect-prognosis methods, conditioned on large-scale 
atmospheric predictors on a daily basis, for instance multi-site generalised linear models (Chandler, 2020). 
Another widely used variant is change-factor weather generators: the weather generator parameters are 
calibrated against present and future climate model simulations, and the climate change signals are then 
applied to the parameters calibrated to observations. Recent research has mainly focussed on multi-site 
Richardson type (Markov-chain) weather generators (Keller et al., 2015; Dubrovsky et al., 2019), some 
explicitly modelling extremes and their spatial dependence (Evin et al., 2018). 
 
 
#### 10.3.1.3.5  Hybrid approaches and emulators 
A wide variety of approaches has been proposed to combine the advantages of different statistical 
approaches. For instance, to overcome the scale mismatch between climate model output and observations, 
bias adjustment has been combined with stochastic downscaling (Volosciuk et al., 2017; Lange, 2019) or 
rescaled analogues (Pierce et al., 2014). Other approaches known as emulators have been developed to 
emulate an RCM using a statistical model and also applied to a range of driving global models (Déqué et al., 
2012; Haas and Pinto, 2012; Walton et al., 2015, 2017; Beusch et al., 2020; Erlandsen et al., 2020). 
 
 
## 10.3.2  Types of Model Experiments 
 
The most commonly used model experiments to generate regional climate information are transient 
simulations. Alternative experiment types serve specific purposes. The role of these experiment types for 
generating regional climate information is assessed in this subsection. 
 
 
### 10.3.2.1  Transient simulations and time-slice experiments 
 
Transient simulations intend to represent the evolving climate state of the Earth system (Chapter 4). They are 
typically based on coupled global model simulations, such as those in the DECK and ScenarioMIP part of 
CMIP6 covering the period 1850–2100 (Eyring et al., 2016a), and HighResMIP (1950–2050; Haarsma et al., 
2016). Global transient climate simulations may be further downscaled by either dynamical or statistical 
downscaling. Currently available CORDEX RCM simulations (1950–2100) are based on CMIP5 (Gutowski 
et al., 2016). 
 
In contrast, time-slice experiments are designed to represent only a specific period of time (typically 30 
years). They are often run using global and regional models in atmosphere-only mode, forced by SSTs 
derived either from observations, as AMIP experiments, or from historical simulations and future projections 
of coupled global models. Compared to transient simulations, they offer advantages in being computationally 
cheaper (due to the lack of coupled ocean and short duration), which allows for the number of ensemble 
members (Zhang et al., 2016c), and/or the resolution (Haarsma et al., 2013a; Davini et al., 2017) to be 
increased. Convection-permitting simulations, both covering the globe or particular regions, are currently 
conducted for short time slices only (Kendon et al., 2017; Hewitt and Lowe, 2018; Coppola et al., 2020; 
Pichelli et al., 2021). Another high-resolution time-slice data base is d4PDF (Mizuta et al., 2017; Ishii and 
Mori, 2020). Experiments covering a limited integration period have been carried out for coupled ocean-
atmosphere RCMs (Sein et al., 2015; Zou and Zhou, 2016b, 2017). However, long spin-up periods are 
required to reach a stable stationary state in the deep ocean that otherwise might lead to invalid projections 
(Planton et al., 2012; Soto-Navarro et al., 2020). 
 
 
### 10.3.2.2  Pseudo-global warming experiments  
 
Results from downscaling experiments often suffer from large-scale circulation biases in the driving GCMs 
such as misplaced storm tracks (Section 10.3.3.4), while changes in atmospheric circulation are often 
uncertain owing to both climate response uncertainty (Section 10.3.4.2) and internal variability (Section 
10.3.4.3). In a given application, if one can assume that changes in the regional climate are dominated by 
thermodynamic rather than by circulation changes, so-called pseudo-global warming (PGW) experiments 
(Schär et al., 1996) may be helpful in mitigating the effects of circulation biases, and to fix the large-scale 
circulation to present climate. In classical PGW experiments, boundary conditions for the downscaling are 
taken from reanalysis data, but modified according to the thermodynamic signals of climate change. The 
boundary conditions thus represent the sequence of observed weather, but with adjusted temperatures, 
humidity and atmospheric stability. Recent applications of PGW experiments include assessments of climate 
change in Japan (Adachi et al., 2012; Kawase et al., 2012, 2013), the Los Angeles area (Walton et al., 2015), 
Hawaii (Zhang et al., 2016a), and the Alps (Keller et al., 2018). Recently, PGW studies have been 
generalised to modify global model simulations with the objective of separating the drivers of regional 
climate change, such as the Mediterranean amplification (e.g., Brogli et al., 2019a; Section 10.3.2.3). 
 
Equivalent simulations can be conducted for individual events, thereby allowing for very high resolution. 
With counterfactual past climate conditions, such simulations can be used for conditional event attribution 
(Trenberth et al., 2015; Chapter 11), using hypothetical future conditions to generate physical climate 
storylines of how specific events may manifest in a warmer climate. The approach has been employed to 
study extreme events that require very high resolution simulations such as tropical cyclones (Lackmann, 
2015; Takayabu et al., 2015; Lau et al., 2016; Kanada et al., 2017a; Gutmann et al., 2018; Patricola and 
Wehner, 2018; Chen et al., 2020a) or convective precipitation events (Pall et al., 2017; Hibino et al., 2018). 
The range of possible events is broader and has included Korean heat waves (Kim et al., 2018) and monsoon 
onset in West Africa (Lawal et al., 2016). However, if only individual events are simulated, no immediate 
conclusions can be derived for changes to the occurrence probability of these events (Otto et al., 2016a; 
Shepherd, 2016a).  
 
### 10.3.2.3  Sensitivity studies with selected drivers  
 
Sensitivity studies are used to identify the impact of a specific forcing, driver or process on regional climate 
phenomena and changes and improve the process understanding. The influence of a single external forcing 
can be assessed with transient historical simulations within two different frameworks (Bindoff et al., 2013; 
Gillett et al., 2016). The first entails simulations taking prescribed (often observed) changes only in the 
external forcing of interest, the others being fixed at a constant value (often pre-industrial). The second 
framework is based on simulations in which all external forcings are applied other than the one of interest. 
Both approaches may not give the same results since the climate response to a range of forcings is not 
necessarily equal to the sum of climate responses to individual forcings (Ming and Ramaswamy, 2011; Jones 
et al., 2013; Schaller et al., 2013; Shiogama et al., 2013; Marvel et al., 2015; Deng et al., 2020). 
 
To study the influence of internal variability, new approaches such as partial coupling simulations are now 
routinely used since AR5. These are coupled ocean-atmosphere simulations in which the interaction between 
atmosphere and ocean is only one-way over a specified ocean basin or sub-basin and two-way everywhere 
else. Different implementations have been used such as SST anomaly Newtonian relaxation at the air-sea 
interface or prescription of wind-stress anomalies from reanalysis (Kosaka and Xie, 2013, 2016; England et 
al., 2014; McGregor et al., 2014; Douville et al., 2015; Deser et al., 2017a). Such simulations have been 
applied to identify the regional impacts of the Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV) and Atlantic Multidecadal 
Variability (AMV) (Kosaka and Xie, 2013; Watanabe et al., 2014; Delworth et al., 2015; Boer et al., 2016; 
Ruprich-Robert et al., 2017, 2018). 
 
Nudging experiments have been used to identify the relative roles of dynamic and thermodynamic processes 
in climate model biases and specific extreme events (Wehrli et al., 2018, 2019). Another related framework 
is used to evaluate the impact land conditions have on a climate phenomenon in a pair of experiments with 
one simulation serving as control run, and a perturbed simulation with prescribed land conditions (i.e., soil 
moisture, leaf area index, or surface albedo) characterizing a specific state of the land surface (i.e., 
afforestation or deforestation). The difference between the perturbed and control simulations enables a robust 
assessment of the possible impact of land conditions on events like droughts and heatwaves (Seneviratne et 
al., 2013; Stegehuis et al., 2015; Hauser et al., 2016, 2017; van den Hurk et al., 2016; Vogel et al., 2017; 
Rasmijn et al., 2018; Strandberg and Kjellström, 2019). 
 
RCM sensitivity simulations have been used in a similar way to assess the contribution of external forcings 
and large-scale drivers to projected regional climate change (Nabat et al., 2014; Brogli et al., 2019b, 2019a) 
and the influence of selected drivers on observed extreme events (Meredith et al., 2015b; Wang et al., 2017a; 
Ardilouze et al., 2019). 
 
In summary, there is robust evidence that sensitivity experiments are key to assessing the influence of 
different forcings and drivers on regional climate change. 
 
 
### 10.3.2.4  Control simulations  
 
In recent years, the role of internal variability in the interpretation of climate projections has become clearer, 
particularly at the regional scale (Section 10.3.4.3). A considerable fraction of CMIP5 and CMIP6 resources 
has been invested in generating an ensemble of centennial or multi-centennial control simulations with 
constant external forcings (Pedro et al., 2016; Rackow et al., 2018). As part of the CMIP6 DECK (Eyring et 
al., 2016a) pre-industrial control (piControl) simulations have been conducted (Menary et al., 2018). 
Similarly, control simulations with present-day conditions (pdControl) have been performed to represent 
internal variability under more recent forcing conditions (Pedro et al., 2016; Williams et al., 2018). Control 
simulations have been used to study the role of internal variability, teleconnections and many other 
fundamental aspects of climate models (Wang et al., 2015b; Krishnamurthy and Krishnamurthy, 2016). 
Control simulations are also used along with large ensembles of historical or scenario simulations to assess 
the characteristics of the regional internal climate variability (Olonscheck and Notz, 2017). 
 
 
### 10.3.2.5  Simulations for evaluating downscaling methods 
 
Experiments driven by quasi-perfect boundary conditions or predictors (observations or reanalysis) can be 
useful to evaluate downscaling performance (Frei et al., 2003; Laprise et al., 2013), including the simulation 
of observed past trends (Lorenz and Jacob, 2010; Zubler et al., 2011; Nabat et al., 2014; Gutiérrez et al., 
2018; Drugé et al., 2019; Bozkurt et al., 2020) and the added value of downscaling compared to the 
reanalysis fields (Section 10.3.3.2). Although the reanalysis model itself can introduce biases especially for 
non-assimilated variables (such as precipitation) it is assumed that in such a setting, discrepancies between 
the modelled and observed climate arise mostly from errors in the downscaling method (Laprise et al., 2013) 
or internal climate variability generated by the downscaling method (Böhnisch et al., 2020; Ehmele et al., 
2020). Since AR5, reanalysis-driven RCMs have been extensively evaluated for many regions, especially in 
the CORDEX framework (see region specific examples in the Atlas). 
 
Over Europe, the VALUE initiative assessed statistical downscaling for marginal, temporal, and spatial 
aspects of temperature and precipitation including extremes, and performed a process-based evaluation of 
specific climatic phenomena (Gutiérrez et al., 2018; Maraun et al., 2018). Alternatively, statistical 
downscaling can be evaluated in so-called perfect model or pseudo-reality simulations (Charles et al., 1999), 
where a high-resolution climate model simulation is used as a proxy for a hypothetical present and future 
realities. A statistical downscaling model is first calibrated with this pseudo present-day climate and, 
subsequently, assessed whether it correctly reproduces the pseudo-future conditions (Dixon et al., 2016). 
 
 
## 10.3.3  Model Performance and Added Value in Simulating and Projecting Regional Climate 
 
Assessing model performance is a prerequisite for building confidence in regional climate projections. This 
subsection assesses the performance of different model types at simulating regional climate and climate 
change. The subsection builds on the assessment of global model performance in Chapter 3, and 
complements the model assessment in Chapter 8, which focuses on the water cycle, and the Atlas. 
 
<figref>10.6</figref> 
 
While the ability of global models to simulate large-scale indicators of climate change has improved since 
AR5 (Chapter 3), the simulation of regional climate and climate change poses an additional challenge. Users 
demand regional climate projections for decision making and have high expectations regarding accuracy and 
resolution (Rössler et al., 2019a), but some scientists consider such projections still a matter of basic research 
(Hewitson et al., 2014a). For instance, large-scale circulation biases or the misrepresentation of regional 
topography as well as regional phenomena and feedbacks are very relevant (Hall, 2014; Maraun and 
Widmann, 2018b). New global model ensembles such as CMIP6 (Eyring et al., 2016a), HighResMIP 
(Haarsma et al., 2016) or, at the regional scale, the convection permitting simulations from the CORDEX 
Flagship Pilot Study (FPS) on convective phenomena (Coppola et al., 2020) have the potential to 
substantially improve the basis for generating regional climate information, yet uncertainties and (often 
unresolved) contradictions between model projections at the regional scale can be substantial (Fernández et 
al., 2019). 
 
Figure 10.6 shows the mean summer temperature and precipitation biases of several state-of-the-art climate 
model ensembles for the western Mediterranean. It additionally illustrates the role of observational 
uncertainty for model evaluation (Section 10.2), where observations display differences that can be 
substantial. Model performance varies strongly from model to model, but also between ensembles. These 
biases are an expression of model error that leads to misrepresented phenomena and processes, and thus limit 
the confidence in future projections of regional climate. The focus of this subsection is therefore to evaluate 
the representation of relevant regional scale phenomena for representing regional climate. 
 
 
### 10.3.3.1  Evaluation diagnostics 
 
Since AR5, model evaluation has made use of a broad combination of diagnostics (Colette et al., 2012; 
Kotlarski et al., 2014; Eyring et al., 2016b; Gleckler et al., 2016; Ivanov et al., 2017, 2018; Vautard et al., 
2020), ranging from long-term means to indices of extreme events (Zhang et al., 2011; Sillmann et al., 2013) 
or a combination of these (Dittus et al., 2016). This evaluation has shown that global models have pervasive 
biases in some aspects of their large-scale behaviour (Section 1.5.3.1, Chapter 3). More complex diagnostics 
are used to characterize specific meteorological phenomena (Sprenger et al., 2017), such as feedbacks in the 
El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO; Bellenger et al., 2014), Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) 
characteristics (Ahn et al., 2017; Benedict et al., 2014; Jiang et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015), extra-tropical 
modes of variability (Lee et al., 2019), cyclone tracking (Neu et al., 2013; Flaounas et al., 2018), front 
detection (Hope et al., 2014; Schemm et al., 2015), thunderstorm environment parameters (Bukovsky et al., 
2017), African easterly waves (McCrary et al., 2014; Martin and Thorncroft, 2015), land-atmosphere 
coupling (Spennemann and Saulo, 2015; Santanello et al., 2018), and sea-atmosphere coupling (Bellenger et 
al., 2014; Mayer et al., 2017). 
 
New diagnostics for multivariate dependencies are needed to characterize compound events (Section 11.8; 
Hobaek Haff et al., 2015; Wahl et al., 2015; Sippel et al., 2016, 2017; Tencer et al., 2016; Bevacqua et al., 
2017; Careto et al., 2018; Zscheischler et al., 2018b). However, their success depends on the availability of 
adequate observational data (Section 10.2.2). Multivariate dependencies discovered in compound events can 
also be used for designing and evaluating multivariate bias adjustment and statistical downscaling. Process-
based diagnostics are useful for identifying the cause of model errors, although it is not always possible to 
associate a systematic error with a specific cause (Eyring et al., 2019). AR5 discussed two approaches of 
process-based evaluation: 1) the isolation of physical components or parameterizations by dedicated 
experiments (Section 10.3.2.4) and 2) diagnostics conditioned on relevant regimes, usually synoptic-scale 
weather patterns. The regime-based approach has been used with both global models (e.g., Barton et al., 
2012; Catto et al., 2015; Taylor et al., 2019) and RCMs (Endris et al., 2016; Bukovsky et al., 2017; Whan 
and Zwiers, 2017; Pinto et al., 2018), but also with perfect prognosis and bias adjustment methods (Marteau 
et al., 2015; Addor et al., 2016; Beranová and Kyselý, 2016; Soares and Cardoso, 2018; Soares et al., 
2019b). 
 
Recent studies highlight the importance of user-defined or user-relevant diagnostics for model evaluation 
(Maraun et al., 2015; Rhoades et al., 2018; Rössler et al., 2019b; Nissan et al., 2020). Diagnostics have been 
used to assess the performance of climate models to produce useful input data for impact models as in the 
comparison between RCMs and convection-permitting models to capture flood generating precipitation 
events in the Alps (Reszler et al., 2018). Alternatively, the observed impact can be compared to that 
simulated by an impact model that uses input from both observations and climate models. This approach has 
been used to evaluate the influence of statistical downscaling and bias adjustment on hydrological (Rojas et 
al., 2011; Chen et al., 2012b; Gutiérrez et al., 2019; Rössler et al., 2019b), agricultural (Ruiz-Ramos et al., 
2016; Galmarini et al., 2019), forest and wildfire (Abatzoglou and Brown, 2012; Migliavacca et al., 2013) 
(Bedia et al., 2013), snow depth (Verfaillie et al., 2017), and regional ocean modelling (e.g., Macias et al., 
2018). 
 
There is high confidence that to assess whether a climate model realistically simulates required aspects of 
present-day regional climate, and to increase confidence of future projections of these aspects, evaluation 
needs to be based on diagnostics taking into account multiple variables and process-understanding. 
 
 
### 10.3.3.2  Model improvement and added value 
 
Obtaining regional information from global simulations may involve a range of different methods (Section 
10.3.1). An approach with higher complexity or resolution is useful if it adds further, useful information to 
that of a reference model. Section 10.5 discusses the set of considerations that determine if the information is 
useful. This further useful information is often referred to as added value and is a function of variables, 
processes, and the temporal and spatial scales targeted taking into account the needs of specific users (Di 
Luca et al., 2012; Ekström et al., 2015; Giorgi and Gutowski, 2015; Torma et al., 2015; Rummukainen, 
2016; Falco et al., 2018). There is no common definition of added value, but here it is considered a 
characteristic that arises when one methodology gives further value to what another methodology yields. 
 
Downscaling is expected to improve the representation of a region’s climate compared to the driving GCM 
(Di Luca et al., 2015). Arguably, there should be a clear physical reason for the improvement, which is 
applicable to the evaluation of added value in downscaled projections (Giorgi et al., 2016). The added value 
depends on the region, season, and governing physical processes (Lenz et al., 2017; Schaaf and Feser, 2018).  
Thus, added value of downscaling GCM simulations is most likely where regional- and local-scale processes 
play an important role in a region’s climate, for example in complex or heterogeneous terrain such as 
mountains (Lee and Hong, 2014; Prein et al., 2016a), urban areas (Argüeso et al., 2014), along coastlines 
(Feser et al., 2011; Herrmann et al., 2011; Bozkurt et al., 2019), or where convective processes are important 
(Prein et al., 2015). Examples of model improvements and added value are given in the following 
subsections and the Atlas. 
 
A first step in determining added value in downscaling is to analyse whether the downscaling procedure 
gives detail on spatial or temporal scales not well-resolved by a GCM, thus potentially representing climatic 
features missing in the GCM. This added detail, referred to as potential added value (PAV; Di Luca et al., 
2012), is insufficient for demonstrating added value in downscaling (Takayabu et al., 2016), but lack of PAV 
indicates that the downscaling method lacks usefulness. Added value is not guaranteed simply by producing 
model output at finer resolution. It depends on several factors, such as the simulation setup and the specific 
climatic variables analysed (Di Luca et al., 2012; Hong and Kanamitsu, 2014; Xue et al., 2014). A variety of 
performance measures are needed to assess added value (Section 10.3.3.1; Di Luca et al., 2016; Wilks, 2016; 
Ivanov et al., 2017, 2018; Soares and Cardoso, 2018). 
 
A further challenge, especially at increasingly higher resolutions, is that adequate observational data may not 
be available to assess added value (Section 10.2, e.g., Di Luca et al., 2016; Zittis et al., 2017; Bozkurt et al., 
2019). This implies a need for additional efforts to obtain, catalogue and quality-control higher resolution 
observational (or observation-based) data sets (Thorne et al., 2017; Section 10.2). Univariate demonstration 
of added value is necessary, but may be insufficient, as better agreement with observations in the downscaled 
variable may be a consequence of compensating errors that are not guaranteed to compensate similarly as 
climate changes. Multivariate analysis of added value is better able to demonstrate physical consistency 
between observed and simulated behaviour (Prein et al., 2013a; Meredith et al., 2015a; Reboita et al., 2018). 
 
### 10.3.3.3  Performance at simulating large-scale phenomena and teleconnections relevant for regional climate 

Regional climate is often controlled by large-scale weather phenomena, modes of variability and 
teleconnections (e.g., Sections 2.3 and 2.4, Annex IV). In particular extreme events are often caused by 
specific, in some cases persistent, circulation patterns (Sections 11.3–11.7). It is therefore important for 
climate models to reasonably represent not only continental, but also regional climate and its variability for 
such extremes. As explained in Section 3.3.3, standard resolution GCMs can suffer biases in the location, 
occurrence frequency or intensity of large-scale phenomena, such that statements about a specific regional 
climate and its change can be highly uncertain (Hall, 2014). RCMs have difficulties improving especially 
large-scale circulation biases, although some successful examples exist. But due to their enhanced 
representation of complex topography and coastlines, RCMs may add value to simulating the regional 
expression of teleconnections. Bias adjustment cannot mitigate fundamental misrepresentations of the large-
scale atmospheric circulation (Maraun et al., 2017, Cross-Chapter Box 10.2). This subsection illustrates the 
relevance of large-scale circulation biases for regional climate assessments with selected examples from the 
mid-to-high latitudes and tropics. 
 
 
#### 10.3.3.3.1  Mid-to-high latitude atmospheric variability phenomena: blocking and extratropical cyclones 

Major large-scale meteorological phenomena for mid-to-high latitude mean and extreme climate include 
atmospheric blocking and extratropical cyclones (Section 2.3.1.4). Atmospheric blocking is characterized by 
a quasi-stationary long-lasting, high pressure system that blocks and diverts the movement of synoptic 
cyclones (Woollings et al., 2018). In regions where blocking occurs, it is known to lead to cold conditions in 
winter and warmth and drought during summer, defining the seasonal regional climate in certain years 
(Sousa et al., 2017, 2018b). Extratropical cyclones are storm systems that propagate preferentially in 
confined storm-track regions, characterized by large eddy-kinetic energy, heat and momentum transports that 
shape regional weather at mid-to-high latitudes (Shaw et al., 2016). Given their importance in shaping mean 
and extreme regional climate (Sections 3.3.3.3, 11.3 and 11.4), an accurate representation of blocking and 
extratropical cyclones in global and regional climate models is needed to better understand regional climate 
variability and extremes as well as to project future changes (Section 11.7.2; Grotjahn et al., 2016; Mitchell 
et al., 2017; Rohrer et al., 2018; Huguenin et al., 2020). An overview of CMIP5 and CMIP6 model 
performance in simulating blocking and extratropical cyclones is given in Section 3.3.3.3. CMIP6 models 
still suffer from long-standing blocking biases identified in previous generations of models. However, 
blocking location has improved compared to CMIP5, while comparable performance is seen for blocking 
frequency and persistence (Figure 10.7). Increasing horizontal model resolution to about 20 km in the 
HighResMIP experiments improves the representation of blocking frequency and its spatial pattern in most 
models, but no clear effect could be shown for blocking persistence. Biases associated with these two 
phenomena are highly region- and season-dependent and their amplitudes vary among CMIP models 
(Drouard and Woollings, 2018; Schaller et al., 2018; Woollings et al., 2018; Harvey et al., 2020; Schiemann 
et al., 2020). 
 
<figref>10.7</figref> 
 
RCMs have a very limited ability to reduce large-scale circulation errors of the driving GCM (Hall, 2014). In 
a study of five ERA-Interim-driven RCMs, Jury et al. (2018) showed that RCMs typically simulate fewer 
blocking events over Europe than are present in the driving data, irrespective of the RCM horizontal 
resolution. Based on a simple blocking bias-decomposition method, they suggest that blocking frequency 
biases can contribute to the RCM mean surface biases. Over some large domains, reanalysis-driven RCMs 
can significantly improve the representation of storm characteristics compared to the driving reanalysis near 
regions with complex orography and/or large water masses (Poan et al., 2018). However, this is not 
necessarily true if the domain is large enough because the RCM and its biases will then control the 
circulation leading to a biased performance with regard to storm characteristics (Pontoppidan et al., 2019). 
An ensemble of 12 RCMs with and without air-sea coupling reasonably reproduced the climatology of 
Mediterranean cyclones, and air-sea coupling had a rather weak impact (Flaounas et al. 2018). Over the Gulf 
Stream, however, air-sea coupling played an important role in representing cyclone development (Vries et 
al., 2019). Sánchez-Gómez and Somot (2018) showed that the effect of RCM internal variability on density 
of cyclone tracks is very significant and larger than for other variables such as precipitation. It is larger in 
summer than in winter, in particular over the Iberian Peninsula, northern Africa and the eastern 
Mediterranean, which are regions of enhanced cyclogenesis during the warm season. 
 
Biases in the representation of large-scale atmospheric circulation can result in biased representation of 
regional climate. While the connection between large-scale and regional biases is in principle obvious, given 
the strong control of regional climate by large-scale phenomena, research on this connection is still limited. 
Munday and Washington (2018) relate CMIP5 model rainfall biases over South Africa to anomalous low-
level moisture transport across high-topography due to upstream wind biases and inaccurate representation 
of unresolved orographic drag effects. Addor et al. (2016) show that the overestimated frequency of westerly 
synoptic situations was a significant contributor to the wet bias in several RCMs in winter over Switzerland. 
Pepler et al. (2014, 2016) suggest that better capturing westerly-driven synoptic systems such as cold fronts 
and cut-off lows in climate models could be key in simulating the observed pattern correlation between 
rainfall and zonal wind in southern southeast Australia. Cannon (2020) shows global improvement in 
performance going from CMIP5 to CMIP6 for both frequency and persistence of circulation types. 
 
The robust quantification of the influence of atmospheric circulation errors on regional climate remains a 
challenge as many parameterized processes such as cloud radiative effects and soil moisture or snow 
feedbacks can also contribute and interact with the circulation errors. Atmospheric nudging experiments 
where the simulated circulation is constrained to be close to that observed have been used to separate the 
circulation effect from other contributions to regional climate biases (Wehrli et al., 2018). The nudging 
approach requires detailed and careful implementation in order to limit detrimental effects due to the added 
tendency term in the model equations (Zhang et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2016). Based on single-model 
experiments, Wehrli et al. (2018) show that the circulation-induced biases are often not the main contributors 
to mean and extreme temperature and precipitation biases for many regions and seasons.  
 
There is high confidence that atmospheric circulation biases can deteriorate the model representation of 
regional land surface climate. Assessing the relative contributions of atmospheric circulation and other 
sources of bias remains a challenge due to the strong coupling between the atmosphere and other 
components of the climate system, including the land surface. 
 
 
#### 10.3.3.3.2  Tropical phenomena: ENSO teleconnections 

Model performance in simulating ENSO characteristics, including ENSO spatial pattern, frequency, 
asymmetry between warm and cold events, and diversity, is assessed in Chapter 3 (Section 3.7.3). The ability 
of the recent generation of GCMs and RCMs to adequately simulate ENSO-related teleconnections is 
reviewed here along with relevant methodological issues (see also Annex IV2.3.2, Figure 3.38 and Section 
3.7.3). 
 
Langenbrunner and Neelin (2013) show that there is little improvement in CMIP5 relative to CMIP3 in 
amplitude and spatial patterns of the ENSO influence on boreal winter precipitation (spatial pattern 
correlations against observations are typically less than 0.5). However, the CMIP5 ensemble accurately 
represents the amplitude of the precipitation response in regions where observed teleconnections are strong. 
(Garcia-Villada et al., 2020) found a decline in performance of the representation of simulated ENSO 
teleconnection patterns for model experiments with fewer observational constraints. They also show that 
ENSO warm phase (El Niño) teleconnections are better represented than those for the cold phase (La Niña). 
Individual CMIP5 and CMIP6 models show a good ability to represent the observed teleconnections at 
aggregated spatial scales (Power and Delage, 2018; Section 3.7.3 and Figure 3.38). The evaluation of the 
atmospheric dynamical linkages is also an important part of the assessment. Hurwitz et al. (2014) showed 
that CMIP5 models broadly simulate the expected (as seen in the MERRA reanalysis) upper-tropospheric 
responses to central equatorial Pacific or eastern equatorial Pacific ENSO events in boreal autumn and 
winter. CMIP5 models also simulate the correct sign of the Arctic stratospheric response, consisting of polar 
vortex weakening during eastern and central Pacific Niño events and vortex strengthening during both types 
of La Niña events. In contrast, most CMIP5 models do not capture the observed weakening of the Southern 
Hemisphere polar vortex in response to central Pacific ENSO events (Brown et al., 2013). 
 
In RCMs, the effects of tropical large-scale modes and teleconnections are inherited through the boundary 
conditions and influenced by the size of the numerical domain. Done et al. (2015) and Erfanian and Wang 
(2018) claim that large domains that include source oceanic regions are required to capture the remote 
influence of teleconnections, although, without spectral nudging, this can lead to biased synoptic-scale 
patterns (Prein et al., 2019). RCMs generally reproduce the regional precipitation responses to ENSO, and 
can sometimes even improve the representation of these teleconnections compared to the driving reanalysis 
(Endris et al., 2013; Fita et al., 2017), but the overall performance may depend both on the driving reanalysis 
or GCM (Endris et al., 2016; Chandrasa and Montenegro, 2019) and on the chosen RCMs (Whan and 
Zwiers, 2017). 
 
New studies since AR5 have shown that model performance assessment regarding ENSO teleconnections 
remains a difficult challenge due to the different types of ENSO and model errors in ENSO spatial patterns, 
as well as the strong influence of atmospheric internal variability at mid-to-high latitudes (Coats et al., 2013; 
Polade et al., 2013; Capotondi et al., 2015; Deser et al., 2017; Tedeschi and Collins, 2017; Garcia-Villada et 
al., 2020). Another difficulty comes from the non-stationary aspects of teleconnections in both observations 
and models, raising methodological questions on how best to compare a given model with another model or 
observations (Herein et al., 2017; Perry et al., 2017; O’Reilly, 2018; O’Reilly et al., 2019; Abram et al., 
2020). 
 
There is robust evidence that an accurate representation of both atmospheric circulation and SST variability 
are key factors for the realistic representation of ENSO teleconnections in climate models. A robust and 
thorough evaluation of model performance regarding ENSO teleconnections is a challenging task with many 
methodological issues related to asymmetry between the warm and cold phases, non-stationarity and time-
varying interaction between the Pacific and other ocean basins, signal-to-noise issues in the mid-latitudes 
and observational uncertainties, particularly for precipitation (Section 10.2.2.3). 
 
 
### 10.3.3.4   Performance at simulating regional phenomena and processes 
 
Regional climate is shaped by a wide range of weather phenomena occurring at scales from about 2,000 km 
to 2 km (Figure 10.3). These modulate the influence of large-scale atmospheric phenomena and create the 
characteristic and potentially severe weather conditions. The climate in different regions will be affected by 
different mesoscale phenomena, of which several may be relevant. A skilful representation of these 
phenomena is a necessary condition for providing credible and relevant climate information for a given 
region and application. Therefore, it is important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of different 
model types in simulating these phenomena. The performance of different dynamical climate model types to 
simulate a selection of relevant mesoscale weather phenomena is assessed here. 
 
 
#### 10.3.3.4.1  Convection including tropical cyclones 
Convection is the process of vertical mixing due to atmospheric instability. Deep moist convection is 
associated with thunderstorms and severe weather such as heavy precipitation and strong wind gusts. 
Convection may occur in single locations, in spatially extended severe events such as supercells, and 
organised into larger mesoscale convective systems such as squall lines or tropical cyclones, and embedded 
in fronts (see below). Shallow and deep convection are not explicitly simulated but parameterized in standard 
global and regional models. In consequence, these models suffer from several biases. AR5 has stated that 
many CMIP3 and CMIP5 models simulate the peak in the diurnal cycle of precipitation too early, but 
increasing resolution and better parameterisations help to mitigate this problem (Flato et al., 2014). Similar 
issues arise for RCMs with parameterised deep convection (Prein et al., 2015), which also tend to 
overestimate high cloud cover (Langhans et al., 2013; Keller et al., 2016). 
 
Non-hydrostatic RCMs at convection-permitting resolution (4 km and finer) improve features such as the 
initiation and diurnal cycle of convection (Zhu et al., 2012; Prein et al., 2013a, 2013b; Fosser et al., 2015; 
Berthou et al., 2018a; Stratton et al., 2018; Sugimoto et al., 2018; Finney et al., 2019; Ban et al., 2021; 
Pichelli et al., 2021), the triggering of convection by orographic lifting (Langhans et al., 2013; Fosser et al., 
2015), and maximum vertical wind speeds in convective cells (Meredith et al., 2015a). Also spatial patterns 
of precipitation (Prein et al., 2013a, 2013b; Stratton et al., 2018), precipitation intensities (Prein et al., 2015; 
Fumière et al., 2019; Ban et al., 2021; Pichelli et al., 2021), the scaling of precipitation with temperature 
(Ban et al., 2014), cloud cover (Böhme et al., 2011; Langhans et al., 2013) and its resultant radiative effects 
(Stratton et al., 2018), as well as the annual cycle of tropical convection (Hart et al., 2018) are improved. 
Phenomena such as supercells, mesoscale convective systems, or the local weather associated with squall 
lines are not captured by global models and standard RCMs. Convection-permitting RCM simulations, 
however, have been shown to realistically simulate supercells (Trapp et al., 2011), mesoscale convective 
systems, their life cycle and motion (Prein et al., 2017; Crook et al., 2019), and heavy precipitation 
associated with a squall line (Kendon et al., 2014). There is high confidence that simulations at convection 
permitting resolution add value to the representation of deep convection and related phenomena. 
 
Convection is the key ingredient of tropical cyclones. An intercomparison of high-resolution AGCM 
simulations (Shaevitz et al., 2014) showed that tropical cyclone intensities appeared to be better represented 
with increasing model resolution. Takayabu et al. (2015) have compared simulations of typhoon Haiyan at 
different resolutions ranging from 20 km to 1 km (Figure 10.8). While the eyewall structure in the 
precipitation pattern was strongly smoothed in the coarse resolution simulations, it was well resolved at the 
highest resolution. Gentry and Lackmann (2010) found similar improvements in simulating hurricane Ivan 
for horizontal resolutions between 8 km and 1 km. High-resolution coupled ocean-atmosphere simulations 
improve the representation of the radial structure of core convection and thereby the rapid intensification of 
the cyclone (Kanada et al., 2017b). There is high confidence that convection-permitting resolution is required 
to realistically simulate the three-dimensional structure of tropical cyclones. 
 
Initial studies with convection-permitting GCMs suggests that improvements in representing convection, as 
described for RCMs above, have a positive impact on the tropical and extra-tropical atmospheric circulation 
and, thus, regional climate (Satoh et al., 2019; Stevens et al., 2019; see also Section 8.5.1.2 and Chapter 7). 
Computational constraints currently limit these simulations to a length of few months only, such that they 
cannot yet be used for routine climate change studies. 
 
<figref>10.8</figref> 
 
#### 10.3.3.4.2  Mountain wind systems 
Mountain slope and valley winds are localised thermally generated diurnal circulations that have a strong 
influence on temperature and precipitation patterns in mountain regions. During the day, heating of mountain 
slopes induces upslope winds; during the night this circulation reverses. This phenomenon is not realistically 
represented by global models and coarse-resolution RCMs. RCM simulations at 4 km resolution showed 
good skill in simulating the diurnal cycle of temperature and wind on days of weak synoptic forcing in the 
Rocky Mountains (Letcher and Minder, 2017) as well as in simulating the mountain-plain wind circulation 
over the Tianshan mountains in Central Asia (Cai et al. 2019), while in the Alps, a 1 km resolution has been 
required (Zängl, 2004). 
 
Föhn winds are synoptically-driven winds across a mountain range that are warm and dry due to adiabatic 
warming in the downwind side. In an RCM study for the Japanese Alps, Ishizaki and Takayabu (2009) found 
that at least 10 km resolution was required to realistically simulate the basic characteristics of Föhn events. 
 
Synoptically-forced winds may be channelled and accelerated in long valleys. For instance, the Tramontana, 
Mistral and Bora are northerly winds blowing down-valley from central France and the Balkans into the 
Mediterranean (Flaounas et al., 2013). In winter, these winds may cause severe cold air outbreaks along the 
coast. Flaounas et al. (2013) have shown that a GCM with a horizontal resolution of roughly 3.75° 
longitude/1.875° latitude (roughly 400 km x 200 km depending on latitude) is unable to reproduce these 
winds because of the coarse representation of orography. 50-km RCM simulations did not realistically 
represent the Mistral (Obermann et al., 2018) and Bora winds (Belušić et al., 2018), but simulations at 12 km 
added substantial value. Similarly, Cholette et al. (2015) found that a 30-km RCM resolution was not 
sufficient to adequately simulate the channelling of winds in the St Lawrence River Valley in eastern 
Canada, whereas a 10 km resolution was. 
 
There is high confidence that climate models with resolutions of around 10 km or finer are necessary for 
realistically simulating mountain wind systems such as slope and valley winds and the channelling of winds 
in valleys. 
 
 
#### 10.3.3.4.3  Coastal winds and lake effects 
Simulating coastal climates and the influence of big lakes are a modelling challenge, due to the complex 
coastlines, the different heat capacities of land and water, the resulting wind system, and differential 
evaporation. The AR5 concluded that RCMs can add value to the simulation of coastal climates. 
 
Summer coastal low-level jets off the mid-latitude western continental coasts are forced by the semi-
permanent subtropical anticyclones, inland thermal lows, strong across-shore temperature contrasts in 
upwelling regions, and high coastal topography. They are important factors in shaping regional climate by, 
for instance, preventing onshore advection of humidity and thereby causing aridity in the Iberian Peninsula 
(Soares et al., 2014), or by transporting moisture towards precipitating regions as in the North American 
monsoon (Bukovsky et al., 2013). 
 
Reanalyses and most global models do not well resolve the details of coastal low-level jets (Bukovsky et al., 
2013; Soares et al., 2014), but they are still able to represent annual and diurnal cycles and interannual 
variability (Cardoso et al., 2016; Lima et al., 2019). Bukovsky et al. (2013) found RCM simulations at a 50 
km resolution to improve the representation of the coastal low-level jet in the Gulf of California and the 
associated precipitation pattern compared to the driving global models. Lucas-Picher et al. (2017) find 
indirect evidence via precipitation patterns that 12 km simulations further improve the representation. Soares 
et al. (2014) demonstrated that an 8-km resolution RCM simulated a realistic three-dimensional structure of 
the Iberian coastal low-level jet, and the surface winds compare well with observations. Lucas-Picher et al. 
(2017) showed that a 0.44°-resolution RCM underestimated winds along the Canadian east coast, whereas a 
0.11°-resolution version simulated more realistic 10-metre wind speed. Also, the Etesian winds in the 
Aegean Sea were realistically simulated by 12 km-resolution RCMs (Dafka et al., 2018). 
 
A particularly relevant coastal phenomenon is the sea breeze, which is caused by the differential heating of 
water and land during the diurnal cycle and typically reaches several tens of kilometres inland. Reanalyses 
and global models have too coarse a resolution to realistically represent this phenomenon, such that they 
typically underestimate precipitation over islands and misrepresent its diurnal cycle (Lucas-Picher et al., 
2017). RCMs improve the representation of sea breezes and thereby precipitation in coastal areas and 
islands. Over Cuba and Florida only a 12 km-resolution RCM is able to realistically simulate the inland 
propagation of precipitation during the course of the day (Lucas-Picher et al., 2017). RCM simulations at 20 
km horizontal resolution realistically represented the sea breeze circulation in the Mediterranean Gulf of 
Lions including the intensity, direction and inward propagation (Drobinski et al., 2018). Even though a 
coupled ocean-atmosphere simulation improved the representation of diurnal SST variations, the sea breeze 
representation itself was not improved. 
 
Big lakes modify the downwind climate. In particular during winter they are relatively warm compared to 
the surrounding land, provide moisture, destabilize the passing air column and produce convective systems. 
The increase in friction when moving air reaches land causes convergence and uplift, and may trigger 
precipitation. Gula and Peltier (2012) found that a state-of-the-art GCM does not realistically simulate these 
effects over the North American Great Lakes, but a 10 km RCM better represents them and thereby 
simulates realistic downwind precipitation patterns, in particular enhanced snowfall during the winter season. 
Similar results were found by Wright et al. (2013), Notaro et al. (2015) and Lucas-Picher et al. (2017). In a 
convection permitting simulation of the Lake Victoria region, a too strong nocturnal land-breeze resulted in 
unrealistically high precipitation (Finney et al., 2019). 
 
There is high confidence that climate models with sufficiently high resolution are necessary for realistically 
simulating lake and coastal weather including coastal low-level jets, lake and sea breezes, as well as lake 
effects on rainfall and snow. 
 
In regions like Fenno-Scandinavia or central-eastern Canada, very large fractions of land are covered by 
small and medium sized lakes. Other regions have fewer but larger lakes, such as central-eastern Africa, the 
eastern border between the US and Canada, and central Asia. In these regions it has been considered 
essential to include a lake model in an RCM to realistically represent regional temperatures (Deng et al., 
2013; Mallard et al., 2014; Pietikäinen et al., 2018; Samuelsson et al., 2010; Thiery et al., 2015), as well as 
remote effects (Spero et al., 2016). The most common approach in RCMs is the two-layer lake model, 
including a lake-ice model, with parameterized vertical temperature profiles (Mironov et al., 2010; Golosov 
et al., 2018). For the Caspian Sea, it is found that a three dimensional ocean model simulated the SST fields 
better than a one dimensional lake model when coupled to the same RCM (Turuncoglu et al., 2013). 
 
There is medium evidence and high agreement that it is important to include interactive lake models in 
RCMs to improve the simulation of regional temperature, in particular in seasonally ice-covered areas with 
large fractions of lakes. There is medium evidence of the local influence of lakes on snow and rainfall as well 
as the importance of including lakes in regional climate simulations. 
 
 
#### 10.3.3.4.4  Fronts 
Weather fronts are two-dimensional surfaces separating air masses of different characteristics and are a key 
element of mid-latitude cyclones. In particular cold fronts are regions of relatively strong uplift and hence 
often associated with severe weather (e.g., Schemm et al., 2016). Stationary or slowly moving fronts may 
cause extended heavy precipitation. The evaluation of how climate models represent fronts, however, 
remains limited. Catto et al. (2014) found in both ERA-Interim and CMIP5 models that frontal frequency 
and strength were realistically simulated, albeit with some biases in the location. Follow-up investigations, 
for boreal and austral winter (Catto et al., 2015) found frontal precipitation frequency to be too high and the 
intensity too low, but these compensating biases resulted in only a small total precipitation bias. Blázquez 
and Solman (2018) found similar results for Southern Hemisphere winter, and also showed that CMIP5 
models typically overestimate the fraction of frontal precipitation compared to total precipitation. As for the 
reference, the ERA-Interim reanalysis misrepresents conditional symmetric instability associated with fronts, 
and the corresponding precipitation (Glinton et al., 2017). Only a few studies evaluating fronts in RCMs 
have been conducted. Kawazoe and Gutowski (2013) diagnosed strong temperature gradients associated with 
extreme winter precipitation in the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program 
(NARCCAP) RCM ensemble (Mearns et al., 2012) and found the models agreed well with gradients in a 
reanalysis. De Jesus et al. (2016) diagnosed the representations of cold fronts over southern Brazil in two 
RCMs, finding that they were only underestimated by about 5% across the year, but in one RCM, summer 
cold fronts were underestimated by 17%. An RCM-based reanalysis suggests that high-resolution RCM 
simulations improve the representation of orographic influences on fronts (Jenkner et al., 2009). 
 
 
### 10.3.3.5  Performance at simulating regional feedbacks 
 
Both the SRCCL (Jia et al., 2019) and SROCC (Hock et al., 2019) highlight the weaknesses of climate 
models at simulating atmosphere-surface feedbacks. The performance at simulating some of these feedbacks 
is assessed below (climate feedbacks in urban areas are discussed in Box 10.3).  
 
The snow-albedo feedback contributes to enhanced warming at high elevations (Pepin et al., 2015; Section 
8.5). Global models often do not simulate it realistically due to their misrepresentation of orography in 
complex terrain (Hall, 2014; Walton et al., 2015). The elevation dependence of historical warming, which is 
partly caused by the snow-albedo effect, is realistically represented across Europe by the ENSEMBLES 
RCMs (Kotlarski et al., 2015). Some EURO-CORDEX RCMs simulate a springtime snow-albedo feedback 
close to that observed, whereas others considerably overestimate it (Winter et al., 2017). In a multi-physics 
ensemble RCM experiment, the cold bias in northeastern Europe is amplified by the albedo feedback 
(García-Díez et al., 2015). For the Rocky Mountains, RCM simulations generally reproduce the observed 
spatial and seasonal variability in snow cover, but strongly overestimate the snow albedo (Minder et al., 
2016). There is high confidence (medium evidence and high agreement) that RCMs considerably improve the 
representation of the snow albedo effect in complex terrain. 
 
Soil-moisture feedbacks influence changes in both temperature and precipitation. More than 30% of CMIP5 
models overestimate the influence of preceding precipitation (a proxy for soil moisture) on temperature 
extremes in Europe and the USA (Donat et al., 2018), and many CMIP5 models simulate an unrealistic 
influence of evaporation on temperature extremes for wet regions in Europe and the US (Ukkola et al., 
2018). RCMs were found to realistically simulate the correlation between latent and sensible heat fluxes and 
temperature (coupling strength) over Africa (Knist et al., 2017; Careto et al., 2018) and in Northern and 
Southern Europe, but to overestimate it in Central Europe (Knist et al., 2017). Land-surface models driven 
by global reanalysis agreed relatively well with observations. However, the coupling strength varied strongly 
across models at the regional scale, and a realistic partitioning of the incoming radiation into latent and 
sensible heat fluxes did not necessarily result in a realistic soil moisture-temperature coupling (Gevaert et al., 
2018; Boé et al., 2020a). 
 
Evaluating the representation of soil moisture-precipitation feedbacks in climate models is challenging as 
different processes may induce feedbacks including moisture recycling, boundary-layer dynamics and 
mesoscale circulation. Moreover, the effects of soil-moisture on precipitation may be region and scale 
dependent and may even change sign depending on the strength of the background flow (Taylor et al., 2013; 
Froidevaux et al., 2014; Guillod et al., 2015; Larsen et al., 2016; Tuttle and Salvucci, 2016). On seasonal-to-
interannual time scales, CMIP5 models showed a stronger soil-moisture precipitation feedback than 
estimated by satellite data (Levine et al., 2016). Taylor et al. (2013) found that convection-permitting RCMs 
simulate well surface-induced mesoscale circulations in day-time convection and the observed negative soil 
moisture feedback, whereas an RCM with parameterised convection, even when run at the same resolution, 
simulated an unrealistic positive feedback. There is medium evidence and high agreement that simulations at 
convection-permitting resolution are required to realistically represent soil-moisture precipitation feedbacks. 
 
Ocean-atmosphere RCMs have successfully been used to understand and simulate phenomena involving 
strong regional feedbacks like tropical cyclones in the Indian Ocean (Samson et al., 2014), Indian summer 
monsoon (Samanta et al., 2018), East-Asian summer monsoon (Zou et al., 2016), near-coastline intense 
precipitation in the Mediterranean (Berthou et al., 2015, 2018b), air-sea fluxes influencing heat and humidity 
advection over land (Sevault et al., 2014; Lebeaupin Brossier et al., 2015; Akhtar et al., 2018) or snow bands 
in the Baltic region (Pham et al., 2017). The positive impact of ocean-coupling on the simulation of strongly 
convective phenomena such as Medicanes, a class of severe cyclones in the Mediterranean, can only be 
diagnosed when using relatively fine atmospheric resolution of about 10 km (Akhtar et al., 2014; Flaounas et 
al., 2018; Gaertner et al., 2018). A positive impact of ocean coupling has been quantified in marginal sea 
regions with reduced large-scale influence (e.g., in the Baltic Sea area during weak phases of the NAO and 
thus weak influence of Atlantic westerlies (Kjellström et al., 2005; Pham et al., 2018)). There is some 
evidence that coupled ocean-components also positively impact RCM simulations of inland climates such as 
precipitation extremes in Central Europe (Ho-Hagemann et al., 2017; Akhtar et al., 2019). There is high 
confidence that coupled ocean-atmosphere RCMs improve the representation of ocean-atmosphere feedbacks 
and related phenomena. 
 
The influence of ice sheet mass balance on regional climate, explored with global and regional models by  
(Noël et al., 2018; Fettweis et al., 2020), is discussed in Section 9.4. 
 
 
### 10.3.3.6  Performance at simulating regional drivers of climate and climate change 
 
Dust, with its regional character in both emissions and climatic influences, has traditionally been specified in 
climate simulations with a climatological estimate. In CMIP5 models, the influence of vegetation changes on 
mineral dust is largely underestimated while the influence of surface wind and precipitation are 
overestimated, resulting in a low bias of dust load (Pu and Ginoux, 2018). Interactive dust emission modules 
that simulate the dust optical depth in most of the key emission regions have only been recently introduced 
(Pu and Ginoux, 2018). However, coarse dust is underestimated in global models (Adebiyi and Kok, 2020). 
Simulations of future changes in dust are hindered by the uncertainties in future regional wind and 
precipitation as the climate warms (Evan et al., 2016), in the effect of CO2 fertilization on source extent 
(Huang et al., 2017), in the dust feedbacks (Evans et al., 2019), and in the effect of human activities that 
change land use and disturb the soil, including cropping and livestock grazing, recreation and urbanization, 
and water diversion for irrigation (Ginoux et al., 2012). 
 
Volcanoes also provide forcings with a marked regional impact (Cross-Chapter Box 4.1). This implies that 
models are expected to capture these effects (Bethke et al., 2017). Both proxy analyses and simulations have 
demonstrated reduced Asian monsoon precipitation after tropical and Northern Hemisphere volcanic 
eruptions due to reduced humidity and divergent circulation (Man and Zhou, 2014; Zhuo et al., 2014; Liu et 
al., 2016a; Stevenson et al., 2016). Global model experiments (Zanchettin et al., 2013; Ortega et al., 2015; 
Michel et al., 2018; Sjolte et al., 2018) have suggested that tropical volcanic eruptions (larger than the one 
from Mount Pinatubo in 1991) may lead to a positive phase of the winter NAO in the following few years 
(with an uncertainty on the exact years affected), but this influence is not well reproduced in climate models 
(Driscoll et al., 2012; Toohey et al., 2014; Swingedouw et al., 2017; Ménégoz et al., 2018b). The ability to 
simulate the effect of volcanic aerosol in global models is evaluated in VolMIP (Zanchettin et al., 2016). 
Given the relevance of volcanic aerosol, a good knowledge of the initial conditions is important because the 
response has proven to be sensitive to them (Ménégoz et al., 2018a; Zanchettin et al., 2019). A few decadal 
prediction systems have illustrated that current systems can predict some aspects of regional climate a few 
years in advance (Swingedouw et al., 2017; Illing et al., 2018; Ménégoz et al., 2018a; Hermanson et al., 
2020). However, a better performance requires information about volcanic location (Haywood et al., 2013; 
Pausata et al., 2015; Stevenson et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018a), strength (Emile-Geay et al., 2008; Lim et al., 
2016b; Liu et al., 2018b), and seasonality (Stevenson et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2019a, 2019b).  
 
Some recent regional climate changes can only be simulated by climate models if anthropogenic aerosols are 
correctly included (Sections 10.4.2.1, 10.6.3 and 10.6.4; Chapters 6 and 8). Examples of the importance of 
correctly representing anthropogenic aerosols are the recent enhanced warming over Europe (Nabat et al., 
2014; Dong et al., 2017), the cooling over the East Asian monsoon region, leading to a weakening of the 
monsoon (Section 8.3.2.4; Song et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2017b), as well as changes in the monsoons of 
West Africa (Sections 8.3.2.4 and 10.4.2.1) and South Asia (Sections 8.3.2.4 and 10.6.3; Undorf et al., 
2018). The relevance of appropriately representing anthropogenic aerosols has been widely studied in 
regional models (Boé et al., 2020a; Gutiérrez et al., 2020), with an advantage for models with interactive 
aerosol schemes (Drugé et al., 2019; Nabat et al., 2020). Without a fully coupled chemistry module, radiative 
forcing can be simulated by including simple models of sulphate chemistry or specifying the optical 
properties from observations and prescribing the effect of aerosols on the cloud-droplet number (Fiedler et 
al., 2017, 2019; Stevens et al., 2017). In all cases, the specification of the aerosol load limits the 
trustworthiness of the simulations at the regional scale when enough detail is not provided (Samset et al., 
2019; Shonk et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). 
 
The inclusion of irrigation in global and regional models over the South Asian monsoon region (Section 
10.6.3) has been found to be important to represent the monsoon circulation and rainfall correctly (Lucas-
Picher et al., 2011; Guimberteau et al., 2012; Shukla et al., 2014; Tuinenburg et al., 2014; Cook et al., 2015a; 
Devanand et al., 2019). Similarly, the inclusion of irrigation over northern India and western Pakistan could 
be important for the correct simulation of precipitation over the Upper Indus Basin in northern Pakistan 
(Saeed et al., 2013). Irrigation in the East African Sahel inhibits rainfall over the irrigated region and 
enhances instead rainfall to the east, coherent with both observations and theoretical understanding of the 
local circulation anomalies induced by the lower surface air temperatures over the irrigated region (Alter et 
al., 2015). Although several studies show how modelled irrigation reduces daytime temperature extremes, 
few compare modelled results with observations. Global model studies have found improvements in 
simulated surface temperature when including irrigation (Thiery et al., 2017), in particular in areas where the 
model used has a strong land-atmosphere coupling (Chen and Dirmeyer, 2019). An RCM study over the 
North China Plain showed that the inclusion of irrigation led to a better representation of the observed night 
time warming (Chen and Jeong, 2018). 
 
There is medium confidence that representing irrigation is important for a realistic simulation of South Asian 
monsoon precipitation. There is limited evidence that including irrigation in climate models improves the 
simulation of maximum and minimum daily temperatures as well as precipitation for other regions. 
 
Regional land-radiation management, including modifying the albedo through, for instance, no-tillage 
practices, has been suggested as a measure to decrease regional maximum daily temperatures (see review in 
Seneviratne et al., 2018), but although modelled results and theoretical understanding are coherent, few 
studies have verified the results with observations. Hirsch et al. (2018) is an exception, showing that 
implementing minimal tillage, crop residue management and crop rotation in a global model over regions 
where it is practiced, improves the simulation of surface heat fluxes. 
 
 
### 10.3.3.7  Statistical downscaling, bias adjustment and weather generators 
 
The performance of statistical downscaling models, bias adjustment and weather generators is determined by 
the chosen model structure (e.g., to represent variability and extremes or spatial dependence) and, if 
applicable, the predictors selected (Maraun et al., 2019b). The VALUE initiative has assessed a range of 
such methods in a perfect-predictor experiment where the predictors are taken from reanalysis data (Maraun 
et al., 2015, 2019b; Gutiérrez et al., 2019). Table 10.2 shows an overview comprising performance results 
from VALUE and other studies. These results isolate the performance of the statistical method in the present 
climate. The overall performance in a climate change application also depends on the performance of the 
driving climate model (Sections 10.3.3.3–10.3.3.6) and the fitness of both the driving model and the 
statistical method for projecting the climatic aspects of interest (Section 10.3.3.9). 
 
<tableref>10.2</tableref> 
 
#### 10.3.3.7.1  Performance of perfect prognosis methods 
Perfect-prognosis methods can perform well when the synoptic forcing (i.e., the explanatory power of large-
scale predictors) is strong (Schoof, 2013). Using this approach, downscaling of precipitation is particularly 
skilful in the presence of strong orographic forcing. The representation of daily variability and extremes 
requires analogue methods or stochastic regression models, although the former typically do not extrapolate 
to unobserved values (Gutiérrez et al., 2019; Hertig et al., 2019). Temporal precipitation variability is well 
represented by analogue methods and stochastic regression, but analogue methods typically underestimate 
temporal dependence of temperature (Maraun et al., 2019a). Spatial dependence of both temperature and 
precipitation is only well represented by analogue methods, for which analogues are defined jointly across 
locations, and by stochastic regression methods explicitly representing spatial dependence (Widmann et al., 
2019). Overall, there is high confidence that analogue methods and stochastic regression are able to represent 
many aspects of daily temperature and variability, but the analogue method is inherently limited in 
representing climate change (Gutiérrez et al., 2013). 
 
 
#### 10.3.3.7.2  Performance of bias adjustment methods 
This subsection assesses the performance of bias adjustment in a perfect predictor context. In practice, 
climate model imperfections may cause substantial additional issues in the application of bias adjustment. 
These are assessed separately in Cross-Chapter Box 10.2. 
 
Bias adjustment methods, if driven by reanalysis predictors, in principle adjust well all the aspects that they 
intend to address (Maraun and Widmann, 2018b). For temperature, all univariate methods are good for 
adjusting means, variance, and high quantiles (Gutiérrez et al., 2019; Hertig et al., 2019). For precipitation, 
means, intensities, wet-day frequencies, and wet-dry and dry-wet transitions are well adjusted (Gutiérrez et 
al., 2019; Maraun et al., 2019a). The representation of high quantiles depends on the chosen method, 
although flexible quantile mapping performs best (Hertig et al., 2019). Empirical (non-parametric) methods 
perform better than parametric methods over the observed range, but it is unclear how this translates into 
extrapolation to unobserved values (Hertig et al., 2018; Stocker et al., 2015). Many quantile mapping 
methods overestimate interannual variability (Maraun et al., 2019a). Temporal and spatial dependence are 
usually not adjusted and thus inherited from the driving model (Maraun et al., 2019a; Widmann et al., 2019). 
Spatial fields are thus typically too smooth in space, even after bias adjustment (Widmann et al., 2019). 
 
Several studies show improved simulations of present day impacts, when the impact model is fed with bias-
adjusted climate model output, including the assessment of river discharge (Rojas et al., 2011; Muerth et al., 
2013; Montroull et al., 2018), forest fires (Migliavacca et al., 2013), crop production (Ruiz-Ramos et al., 
2016), and regional ocean modelling (Macias et al., 2018). 
 
There is high confidence that bias adjustment can improve the marginal distribution of simulated climate 
variables, if applied to a climate model that adequately represents the processes relevant for a given 
application (Cross-Chapter Box 10.2). 
 
 
#### 10.3.3.7.3  Performance of weather generators 
Weather generators represent well most aspects that are explicitly calibrated. This typically includes mean, 
variance, high quantiles (for precipitation, if explicitly modelled), and short-term temporal variability for 
both temperature and precipitation, whereas interannual variability is strongly underestimated (Frost et al., 
2011; Hu et al., 2013a; Keller et al., 2015; Dubrovsky et al., 2019; Gutiérrez et al., 2019; Hertig et al., 2019; 
Maraun et al., 2019a; Widmann et al., 2019). There is growing evidence that some spatial weather generators 
fairly realistically capture the spatial dependence of temperature and precipitation (Frost et al., 2011; Hu et 
al., 2013a; Keller et al., 2015; Evin et al., 2018; Dubrovsky et al., 2019). There is high confidence that 
weather generators can realistically simulate a wide range of local weather characteristics at single locations, 
but there is limited evidence and low agreement of the ability of weather generators to realistically simulate 
the spatial dependence of atmospheric variables across multiple sites. 
 
 
### 10.3.3.8  Performance at simulating historical regional climate changes 
 
This section assesses how well climate models perform at realistically simulating historical regional climatic 
trends. Current global model ensembles reproduce global to continental-scale surface temperature trends at 
multi-decadal to centennial time scales (CMIP5, CMIP6), but underestimate precipitation trends (CMIP5) 
(Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2). For regional trends, AR5 concluded that the CMIP5 ensemble cannot be taken as 
a reliable representation of reality and that the true uncertainty can be larger than the simulated model spread 
(Kirtman et al., 2014). Case studies of regional trend simulations by global models can be found in Sections 
10.4.1 and 10.6, and region-by-region assessments in the Atlas. A key limitation for assessing the 
representation of regional observed trends by single transient simulations of global models (or downscaled 
versions thereof) is the strong amplitude of internal variability compared to the forced signal at the regional 
scale (Section 10.3.4.3). Even on multidecadal time scales, an agreement between observed and individual 
simulated trends would be expected to occur only by chance (Laprise, 2014). 
 
In the context of downscaling, the ability of downscaling methods to reproduce observed trends when driven 
with boundary conditions or predictors taken from reanalysis data (which reproduce the observed internal 
variability on long time scales) can be assessed. For temperature in the continental USA, reanalysis-driven 
RCMs skilfully simulated recent spring and winter trends, but did not reproduce summer and autumn trends, 
(Bukovsky, 2012). Over Central America, observed warming trends were reproduced (Cavazos et al., 2019). 
In contrast, a reanalysis-driven coupled atmosphere-ocean RCM covering the Mediterranean could not 
reproduce the observed SST trend (Sevault et al., 2014). 
 
Similar studies have been carried out for statistical downscaling and bias adjustment using predictors from 
reanalyses (or in case of bias adjustment, dynamically downscaled reanalyses). For a range of different 
perfect prognosis methods, Huth et al. (2015) found that simulated temperature trends were too strong for 
winter and too weak for summer. The performance was similar for the different methods, indicating the 
importance of choosing sensible predictors. Similarly, Maraun et al. (2017) found that the performance of 
perfect prognosis methods depends mostly on the predictor and domain choice (for instance, temperature 
trends were only captured by those methods including surface temperature as predictor). Bias adjustment 
methods reproduced the trends of the driving reanalysis, apart from quantile mapping methods, which 
deteriorated these trends. 
 
RCM experiments are often set up such that changes in forcing agents are included only via the boundary 
conditions, but not explicitly included inside the domain. Jerez et al. (2018) demonstrated that not including 
time-varying GHG concentrations within the RCM domain may misrepresent temperature trends by 1‒2ºC 
per century. Including the past trend in anthropogenic sulphate aerosols in reanalysis-driven RCM 
simulations substantially improved the representation of recent brightening and warming trends in Europe 
(Nabat et al., 2014; Section 10.3.3.6, 10.6.4, Atlas 8.4). Similarly, Bukovsky (2012) argued that RCMs may 
not capture observed summer temperature trends in the USA because changes in land cover are not taken 
into account. Barlage et al. (2015) have revealed that including the behaviour of groundwater in land 
schemes increases the performance of an RCM model to represent climate variability in the central USA. 
Hamdi et al. (2014) found that an RCM that did not incorporate the historical urbanization in the land-use, 
land-cover scheme is not able to reproduce the warming trend observed in urban stations, with a larger bias 
for the minimum temperature trend. 
 
Overall, there is high confidence that including all relevant forcings is a prerequisite for reproducing 
historical trends. 
 
 
### 10.3.3.9   Fitness of climate models for projecting regional climate 
 
AR5 stated that confidence in climate model projections is based on the physical understanding of the 
climate system and its representation in climate models. A climate model’s credibility for future projections 
may be increased if the model is able to simulate past variations in climate (Flato et al., 2014; Sections 
10.3.3.8, 10.4.1 and 10.6). In particular, the credibility of downscaled information depends on the quality of 
both the downscaling method and of the global model providing the large-scale boundary conditions (Flato 
et al., 2014). Credibility is closely linked to the concept of adequacy or fitness for purpose (Parker, 2009; 
Section 1.5.4.1). From a regional perspective, one may ask about the fitness of a climate model for 
simulating future changes of specific aspects of a specific regional climate. The required level of model 
fitness may depend on the user context (Section 10.5). A key challenge is to link performance at representing 
present and past climate (Sections 10.3.3.3 to 10.3.3.8) to the confidence in future projections (Section 1.3.5; 
Baumberger et al., 2017) and it is addressed in this subsection. 
 
A general idea of model fitness for a given application may be obtained by checking whether relevant large- 
(Section 10.3.3.4) and regional-scale (Sections 10.3.3.5 and 10.3.3.6) processes are explicitly resolved 
(Figure 10.3). The basis for confidence in climate projection is a solid process understanding (Flato et al., 
2014; Baumberger et al., 2017). Thus, the key to assessing the fitness for purpose of a model is the 
evaluation of how relevant processes controlling regional climate are represented (Collins et al., 2018). A 
process-based evaluation may be more appropriate than an evaluation of the variables of interest (e.g., 
temperature, precipitation), because biases in the latter may in principle be reduced if the underlying 
processes are realistically simulated (Cross-Chapter Box 10.2), while individual variables may appear as 
well represented because of compensating errors (Flato et al., 2014; Baumberger et al., 2017). Combining a 
process-based evaluation with a mechanistic explanation of projected changes further increases confidence in 
projections (Bukovsky et al., 2017). Fitness-for-purpose can also be assessed by comparing the simulated 
response of a model with simulations of higher resolution models that better represent relevant processes 
(Baumberger et al., 2017). For instance, Giorgi et al. (2016) have corroborated their findings on precipitation 
changes comparing standard RCM simulations with convection-permitting simulations. 
 
The evaluation of model performance at historical variability and long-term changes provides further 
relevant information (Flato et al., 2014). Trend evaluation may provide very useful insight, but has 
limitations in particular at the regional scale, mainly due to multi-decadal internal climate variability 
(Section 10.3.3.8), observational uncertainty (in both driving reanalysis and local trends; Section 10.2), and 
the fact that often not all regional forcings are known, and that past trends may be driven by forcings other 
than those driving future trends (Sections 10.4.1 and 10.6.3). 
 
Increasing resolution (Haarsma et al., 2016) or performing downscaling may be particularly important when 
it modifies the climate change signal of a lower resolution model in a physically plausible way (Hall, 2014). 
Improvements may result from a better representation of regional processes, upscale effects, as well as the 
possibility of a region-specific model tuning (Sørland et al., 2018). For instance, Gula and Peltier (2012) 
showed that a higher resolution allows for a more realistic simulation of lake-induced precipitation, resulting 
in a more credible projection of changes in the snow belts of the North American Great Lakes. Similarly, 
Giorgi et al. (2016) demonstrated that an ensemble of RCMs better represents high-elevation surface heating 
and in turn increased convective instability. As a result, the summertime convective precipitation response 
was opposite to that simulated by the driving global models (Figure 10.9). Similarly, Walton et al. (2015) 
showed that a kilometre-scale RCM enables a more realistic representation of the snow-albedo feedback in 
mountainous terrain compared to standard resolution global models, leading to a more plausible simulation 
of elevation-dependent warming. Bukovsky et al. (2017) argue that strong seasonal changes in warm-season 
precipitation in the Southern Great Plains of the US, projected by RCMs, are more credible than the weaker 
global model changes because precipitation is better simulated in the RCMs. 
 
<figref>10.9</figref> 
 
Including additional components, feedbacks and drivers can substantially modify the simulated future 
climate. For example, Kjellström et al. (2005) and Somot et al. (2008) have shown that a regional ESM can 
significantly modify the SST response to climate change of its driving global model with implications for the 
climate change signal over both the sea and land. In particular, coupled ocean-atmosphere RCMs may 
increase the credibility of projections in regions of strong air-sea coupling such as the East Asia-western 
North Pacific domain (Zou and Zhou, 2016b, 2017). Recent studies demonstrate the importance of including 
regional patterns of evolving aerosols in RCMs for simulating regional climate change (Boé et al., 2020a; 
Gutiérrez et al., 2020). RCMs not including the plant physiological response to increasing CO2 
concentrations have been shown to substantially underestimate projected increases in extreme temperatures 
across Europe compared to GCMs that explicitly model this effect (Schwingshackl et al., 2019). 
 
A difference between the climate changes simulated by two models does not automatically imply the more 
complex or higher resolution model is superior (e.g., Dosio et al., 2019). Studies comparing convection-
permitting RCM simulations to simulations of climate models with parameterized convection find, 
depending on the considered models, regions and seasons, either similar or qualitatively different projected 
changes in short duration extreme precipitation (Chan et al., 2014b, 2014a, 2020; Ban et al., 2015; Tabari et 
al., 2016; Fosser et al., 2017; Kendon et al., 2017, 2019; Vanden Broucke et al., 2018). Process studies 
provide evidence that convection-permitting simulations better represent crucial local and mesoscale features 
of convective storms and thus simulate more plausible changes (Meredith et al., 2015a; Prein et al., 2017; 
Fitzpatrick et al., 2020), but further research is required to confirm and reconcile the different findings. 
 
Studies assessing the fitness of statistical approaches for regional climate projections are still very limited in 
number. For statistical downscaling, a key issue is to include predictors that control long-term changes in 
regional climate. Models differing only in the choice of predictors may perform similarly in the present 
climate, but may project opposite precipitation changes (Fu et al., 2018; Manzanas et al., 2020). In addition 
to trend-evaluation studies (Section 10.3.3.8), perfect-model experiments (Section 10.3.2.5) have been used 
to assess whether a given model structure with a chosen set of predictors is capable of reproducing the 
simulated future climates (Gutiérrez et al., 2013; Räty et al., 2014; Dayon et al., 2015; Dixon et al., 2016; 
San-Martín et al., 2017). Importantly, it is found that standard analogue methods inherently underestimate 
future warming trends because of missing analogues for a warmer climate (Gutiérrez et al., 2013).  
Bias adjustment assumes that model biases are time invariant (or more precisely, independent of the climate 
state), such that the adjustment made to present climate simulations is still applicable to future climate 
simulations. Many findings challenge the validity of this assumption, as already assessed in AR5 (Flato et 
al., 2014). Further research has addressed this issue by means of perfect model experiments (Section 
10.3.2.5) and process understanding. Perfect-model studies with GCMs found that circulation, energy, and 
water-cycle biases are roughly state-independent (Krinner and Flanner, 2018), whereas temperature biases 
depend linearly on temperature (Kerkhoff et al., 2014). Others show that regional temperature biases may 
depend on soil moisture and albedo, and may thus be state-dependent (Maraun, 2012; Bellprat et al., 2013; 
Maraun et al., 2017; see Cross-Chapter Box 10.2 for further limitations of bias adjustment). The fitness of 
weather generators for future projections depends on whether they account for all relevant changes in their 
parameters, either by predictors or change factors (Maraun and Widmann, 2018b). 

In any case, the fitness of regional climate projections based on dynamical downscaling or statistical 
approaches depends on the fitness of the driving models in projecting boundary conditions, predictors and 
change factors (Hall, 2014; Maraun and Widmann, 2018b). 
 
Overall, there is high confidence that an assessment of model fitness for projections applying process-based 
evaluation, process-based plausibility checks of projections and a comparison of different model types, 
increases the confidence in climate projections. There is high confidence that increasing model resolution, 
dynamical downscaling, statistical downscaling with well simulated predictors controlling regional climate 
change, and adding relevant model components can increase the fitness for projecting some aspects of 
regional climate when accompanied by a process-understanding analysis. 
 
 
### 10.3.3.10  Synthesis of model performance at simulating regional climate and climate change 
 
Global models reproduce many of the features of observed climate and its variability at regional scales. 
However, global models can show a variety of biases in, for instance, precipitation and temperature at scales 
ranging from continental (Prasanna, 2016) to sub-continental scales (Lovino et al., 2018), both in the mean 
and in higher order moments of the climatological distribution of the variable (Ren et al., 2019; Xin et al., 
2020; Figure 10.6). Regional biases could occur even if all the relevant large-scale processes are correctly 
represented, but not their interaction with regional features such as orography or land-sea contrasts (Section 
10.3.3.4). These biases have been considered an important limiting factor in model usability, especially at the 
regional scale (Palmer, 2016). In spite of this, global model simulations have been extensively used to create 
regional estimates of climate change (Chapters 11, 12 and Atlas), taking into account the result of a 
performance assessment (e.g., Jiang et al., 2020; Sections 10.3.3.3 to 10.3.3.8, Chapters 11 and Atlas). 
However, their application is limited in part by the effective resolution of these models (Klaver et al., 2020). 
 
Global model performance at the regional scale is assessed in terms of the time or spatial averages of key 
variables (Brunner et al., 2019; Chapter Atlas), the ability to reproduce their seasonal cycle (Hasson et al., 
2013) or a set of extreme climate indicators (Luo et al., 2020; Chapter 11) and the representation of regional 
processes and phenomena, feedbacks, drivers and forcing impacts (Sections 10.3.3.4–10.3.3.6). In many 
cases, the performance estimates have been used to select models for either an application or a more in-depth 
study (Lovino et al., 2018), to select the models that provide boundary conditions to perform RCM 
simulations (McSweeney et al., 2015) or to weight the results of the GCM simulations (Sanderson et al., 
2015; Brunner et al., 2020). While some large-scale metrics are improved between the CMIP5 and CMIP6 
experiments (e.g., Cannon, 2020; Chapter 3), there is not yet concluding evidence of a systematic 
improvement for surface variables at the regional scale. 
 
The special class of high-resolution global models (Haarsma et al., 2016; Prodhomme et al., 2016; Sections 
1.5.3.1 and 10.3.3.1, Chapter 3) is expected to improve some of the regional processes that are not 
appropriately represented in standard global models (Roberts et al., 2018). There is general consensus that 
increasing global model resolution improves some long-standing biases (Demory et al., 2014, 2020; 
Schiemann et al., 2014; Dawson and Palmer, 2015; van Haren et al., 2015; Feng et al., 2017; Fabiano et al., 
2020; Chapter 3 and 10.3.3.3; Figures 10.6 and 10.7), although the resolution increase is not a guarantee of 
overall improvement (Fabiano et al., 2020; Hertwig et al., 2021; Section 8.5.1). For instance, increasing 
resolution in global models has been shown to improve Asian monsoon rainfall anchored to orography and 
the monsoon circulation (Johnson et al., 2016), but fails to solve the major dry bias. It is also difficult to 
disentangle the role of resolution increase and model tuning on the performance of the GCM (Anand et al., 
2018). Some efforts have been undertaken to complement the performance improvements of resolution by 
using stochastic parameterisations (Palmer, 2019), which explicitly acknowledge the multi-scale nature of 
the climate system, in standard resolution global models with some success (Dawson and Palmer, 2015; 
MacLeod et al., 2016; Zanna et al., 2017, 2019). The expectation is to achieve a similar performance to the 
increase in resolution at a reduced computational cost. 
 
Despite their known errors that affect model performance, there is high confidence that global models 
provide useful information for the production of regional climate information. There is robust evidence and 
high agreement that the increase of global model resolution helps in reducing the biases limiting 
performance at the regional scale, although resolution per se does not automatically solve all performance 
limitations shown by global models. There is robust evidence that stochastic parameterisations can help to 
improve some aspects of the global model performance that are relevant to regional climate information. 
 
Global models tend to have difficulties in simulating climate over regions where unresolved local scale 
processes, feedbacks and nonlinear scale interactions result in a degradation of the model performance 
compared to models with higher resolution. In this case, RCMs and variable resolution global models can 
resolve part of these processes in the regions of interest at an acceptable computational cost (Rummukainen, 
2016; Giorgi, 2019; Gutowski et al., 2020). 
 
The assessment of RCM performance needs to focus not only on mean climatology (Atlas), but also trends 
(Section 10.3.3.8) and extremes (Chapter 11), and the RCM’s ability at correctly reproducing relevant 
processes, forcings and feedbacks (including e.g., aerosols, plant responses to increasing CO2, etc., 
Schwingshackl et al., 2019; Boé et al., 2020; Sections 11.2. and 10.3.3.3 to 10.3.3.8) to be fit for future 
projections (Section 10.3.3.9). 
 
When RCMs are driven by global models, part of the uncertainty in the RCM simulation is introduced by the 
global model biases (Kjellström et al., 2018; Sørland et al., 2018; Christensen and Kjellström, 2020). As 
RCMs are typically not able to mitigate global model biases in large-scale dynamical processes, if such 
biases are substantial, and if the corresponding large-scale processes are important drivers of regional 
climate, downscaling is questionable (Section 10.3.3.3). However, when global models have weak 
circulation biases and regional climate change is controlled mainly by regional-scale processes and 
feedbacks, dynamical downscaling has the potential to add substantial value to global model simulations 
(Hall, 2014; Rummukainen, 2016; Giorgi, 2019; Schwingshackl et al., 2019; Boé et al., 2020; Lloyd et al., 
2020; Section 10.3.3.4 and Chapter Atlas). 
 
There is very high confidence (robust evidence and high agreement) that RCMs add value to global 
simulations in representing many regional weather and climate phenomena, especially over regions of 
complex orography or with heterogeneous surface characteristics and for local-scale phenomena. 
Realistically representing local-scale phenomena such as land-sea breezes requires simulations at a 
resolution of the order of 10 km (high confidence). Simulations at kilometre-scale resolution add value in 
particular to the representation of convection, sub-daily summer precipitation extremes (high confidence) 
and soil moisture-precipitation feedbacks (medium confidence). Resolving regional processes may be 
required to correctly represent the sign of regional climate change (medium confidence). However, the 
performance of RCMs and their fitness for future projections depend on their representation of relevant 
processes, forcings and drivers in the specific context (Sections 10.3.3.4–10.3.3.8). 
 
Statistical downscaling, bias adjustment and weather generators outperform uncorrected output of global and 
regional models for a range of statistical aspects at single locations due to their calibration, but RCMs are 
superior when spatial fields are relevant (Mehrotra et al., 2014; Vaittinada Ayar et al., 2016; Maraun et al., 
2019b). Similarly, there is some evidence that bias adjustment is comparable in performance when applied to 
global models and dynamically downscaled global models only for single locations, but dynamical 
downscaling prior to bias adjustment clearly adds value once spatial dependence is relevant (Maraun et al., 
2019b). These results may explain why dynamical downscaling does not add value to global model 
simulations for (single-site) agricultural modelling, when both global and regional model are bias adjusted 
(Glotter et al., 2014), but dynamical downscaling adds value compared to bias adjusted global model output 
for spatially distributed hydrological models (Qiao et al., 2014). 
 
Overall, statistical downscaling methods with carefully chosen predictors and an appropriate model structure 
for a given application realistically represent many statistical aspects of present-day daily temperature and 
precipitation (high confidence, Section 10.3.3.7). Bias adjustment has proven beneficial as an interface 
between climate model projections and impact modelling in many different contexts (high confidence, 
Section 10.3.3.7). Weather generators realistically simulate many statistical aspects of present-day daily 
temperature and precipitation (high confidence, Section 10.3.3.7). The performance of these approaches and 
their fitness for future projections also depends on predictors and change factors taken from the driving 
dynamical models (high confidence, Section 10.3.3.9). 
 
 
## 10.3.4  Managing Uncertainties in Regional Climate Projections 
 
Regional climate projections are affected by three main sources of uncertainty (Sections 10.2.2, 1.4.3 and 
4.2.5): unknown future external forcings, imperfect knowledge and implementation of the response of the 
climate system to external forcings, and internal variability (Lehner et al., 2020). In a regional downscaling 
context, uncertainties arise in every step of the modelling chain. Here the propagation of uncertainties 
(Section 10.3.4.1), the management of uncertainties (Section 10.3.4.2), the role of the internal variability for 
regional projections (Section 10.3.4.3), and the design and use of ensembles to account for uncertainties 
(Section 10.3.4.4) will be assessed. Observational uncertainty, in particular for the calibration of statistical 
downscaling methods (Section 10.2.3.1), also contributes to projection uncertainty. 
 
 
### 10.3.4.1  Propagation of uncertainties 
 
Modelling chains for generating regional climate information range from the definition of forcing scenarios 
to the global modelling, and potentially to dynamical or statistical downscaling and bias adjustment (Section 
10.3.1). The propagation and potential accumulation of uncertainties along the chain has been termed the 
cascade of uncertainty (Wilby and Dessai, 2010). Even within one model, like a global model, uncertainty 
propagates across scales. From a process point of view, these uncertainties are related to forcings and global 
climate sensitivity, and errors in the representation of the large-scale circulation (McNeall et al., 2016; 
Section 10.3.3.3) and regional processes (Section 10.3.3.4), feedbacks (Section 10.3.3.5) and drivers (Section 
10.3.3.6). From a modelling point of view, these uncertainties are related to the choice of dynamical and 
statistical models (Section 10.3.1) and experimental design (Section 10.3.2). The overall uncertainty can be 
statistically decomposed into the individual sources (Evin et al., 2019; Christensen and Kjellström, 2020), 
although there might be nonlinear dependencies between them. 
 
Uncertainty propagation often increases the spread in regional climate projections when comparing global 
model and downscaled results, which has been used as an argument against top-down approaches to climate 
information (Prudhomme et al., 2010). Increased spread in the modelling chain may also arise from a more 
comprehensive representation of previously unknown or underrepresented uncertainties (Maraun and 
Widmann, 2018b). The increased spread in this case goes together with a better representation of processes 
and thus an increased model fitness for purpose (Section 10.3.3.9). 
 
 
### 10.3.4.2  Representing and reducing uncertainties 
 
Climate response uncertainties (Chapter 1) can be represented by multi-model ensembles, although the 
sampled uncertainty typically underestimates the full range of uncertainty (Collins et al., 2013b; Shepherd et 
al., 2018; Almazroui et al., 2021). Traditionally, climate response uncertainty has been characterized by the 
ensemble spread around the multi-model mean change. The change has then further been qualified in terms 
of the agreement across models and compared to estimates of internal climate variability (Collins et al., 
2013b). Since AR5, several limitations of this approach have been identified (Madsen et al., 2017) such as 
the failure to address physically plausible, but low probability high-impact scenarios (Chapters 1, 4, 8 and 9; 
Sutton, 2018) or that qualitatively different or even opposite changes may be equally plausible at the regional 
scale (Shepherd, 2014). In a multi-model mean these different responses would be lumped together, strongly 
dampened, and qualified as non-robust, whereas in fact high impacts might occur. Further, the multi-model 
mean itself is often implausible because it is a statistical construct (Zappa and Shepherd, 2017). Overall, 
there is high confidence that some regional future climate changes are not well characterised by multi-model 
mean and spread. 
 
Since AR5, physical climate storyline approaches (see also Chapter 1, Box 10.2, Section 10.5.3, and Atlas 
2.5.2) have been developed to better characterise and communicate uncertainties in regional climate 
projections (Shepherd, 2019). A special class of such storylines attempts to attribute regional uncertainties to 
uncertainties in remote drivers. For instance, the Dutch Meteorological Service has presented climate 
projections for the Netherlands for different plausible changes of the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation 
and different levels of European warming (van den Hurk et al., 2014). Manzini et al. (2014) have quantified 
the impact of uncertainties in tropical upper troposphere warming, polar amplification, and stratospheric 
wind change on Northern Hemisphere winter climate change. Based on these results, Zappa and Shepherd 
(2017) separated the multi-model ensemble into physically consistent sub-groups or storylines of 
qualitatively different projections in relevant remote drivers of the atmospheric circulation. In a similar vein, 
(Ose et al., 2020) trace uncertainties in projections of the East Asian summer monsoon and Mindlin et al. ( 
2020) conditioned the response of Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude circulation and precipitation to 
greenhouse gas forcing on large-scale climate indicators (Section 8.4.2.9.2). 
 
These physical climate storylines help to physically explain contradicting regional projections and thus make 
the conveyed information a better representation of the true uncertainty (Hewitson et al., 2014a). 
Additionally, the attribution of regional uncertainties to drivers may in principle help reduce uncertainty in 
the case where some storylines can be ruled out because the projected changes in the driving processes 
appear to be physically implausible (Zappa and Shepherd, 2017). There is thus high confidence that 
storylines attributing uncertainties in regional projections to uncertainties in changes of remote drivers aid 
the interpretation of uncertainties in climate projections. 
 
Another approach that has continued to develop for characterising and reducing projection uncertainties is 
the use of emergent constraints (Hall et al., 2019; Chapters 1, 4, 5, 7). The idea is to link the spread in 
climate model projections via regression to the spread in present climate model biases for relevant driving 
processes. Models with lower biases are assigned higher weight in the projections, which in turn reduces the 
spread of the projections in a physical way and may additionally reduce projection uncertainty. For instance, 
Simpson et al. (2016) have reduced the spread in projections of North American winter hydroclimate by 
linking this spread to model biases in the representation of relevant stationary wave patterns. Other examples 
of using emergent constraints in a regional context are Brown et al. (2016), Li et al. (2017), Giannini and 
Kaplan (2019), Ose (2019) and Zhou et al.(2019). 
 
 
### 10.3.4.3  Role of internal variability 
 
A regional climate projection based on a single simulation from a single global model or driving a single 
RCM alone will inevitably be affected by not taking into account the internal variability (Figure 10.10). This 
is mainly due to the dominant influence of the chaotic atmospheric circulation on regional climate 
variability, in particular at mid-to-high latitudes. Internal variability is an irreducible source of uncertainty 
for mid-to-long-term projections with an amplitude that typically decreases with increasing spatial scale and 
lead time (Section 1.4.3; Section 4.2.1). However, regional-scale studies show that both large- and local-
scale internal variability together can still represent a substantial fraction of the total uncertainty related to 
hydrological cycle variables, even at the end of the 21st century (Lafaysse et al., 2014; Vidal et al., 2016; 
Aalbers et al., 2018; Gu et al., 2018). 
 
Analysis of multi-model archives such as CMIP or CORDEX simulation results cannot easily disentangle 
model uncertainty and uncertainty related to internal variability. Since AR5, the development of single-
model (GCM and/or RCM) initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs) has emerged as a promising way to 
robustly assess the regional-scale forced response to external forcings and the respective contribution of 
internal variability and model uncertainty to future regional climate changes (Deser et al., 2014, 2020; Kay et 
al., 2015; Sigmond and Fyfe, 2016; Aalbers et al., 2018; Bengtsson and Hodges, 2018; von Trentini et al., 
2019b; Dai and Bloecker, 2019; Leduc et al., 2019; Maher et al., 2019; Lehner et al., 2020; Section 4.2.5). 
The recent development of a multi-model archive of SMILE simulations facilitates the quantification and 
comparison of the influence of internal variability on global model-based regional climate projections 
between different models (Deser et al., 2020; Lehner et al., 2020). Another related development is the more 
frequent use of observation-based statistical models to assess the influence of internal variability on regional-
scale global and regional model projections (Thompson et al., 2015; Salazar et al., 2016). However, these 
methods often implicitly assume that regional-scale internal variability does not change under anthropogenic 
forcing, which is a strong assumption that does not seem to hold at regional and local scales (LaJoie and 
DelSole, 2016; Pendergrass et al., 2017; Cai et al., 2018b; Dai and Bloecker, 2019; Mankin et al., 2020; 
Milinski et al., 2020). 
 
<figref>10.10</figref> 
 
The appropriate ensemble size for a robust use of SMILEs depends on the model and physical variable being 
investigated, the spatial and time aggregation being performed, the magnitude of the acceptable error and the 
type of questions one seeks to answer (Deser et al., 2012, 2017b; Kang et al., 2013; Wettstein and Deser, 
2014; Dai and Bloecker, 2019; Maher et al., 2019). It is noteworthy that the recent development of 
ensembles with a very large ensemble size (greater than 100) have led to new insights and methodologies to 
robustly assess the required ensemble size for questions such as the estimation of the forced response to 
external forcing or a forced change in modes of internal variability, such as ENSO, and its associated 
teleconnections (Herein et al., 2017; Maher et al., 2018; Haszpra et al., 2020; Milinski et al., 2020). 
 
The use of SMILEs assumes that they have a realistic representation of internal variability and its evolution 
under anthropogenic climate change (Eade et al., 2014; McKinnon et al., 2017; McKinnon and Deser, 2018; 
Chen and Brissette, 2019). Assessing the realism of simulated internal variability for past and current 
climates remains an active research field with a number of issues such as the shortness and uncertainties of 
the observed record, in particular in data-scarce regions (Section 10.2.2.3), the signal-to-noise paradox 
(Scaife and Smith, 2018; Section 4.4.3.1), uncertainty in past observed external forcing estimates (Chapters 
2, 6 and 7) and the limitations of assumptions underlying the statistical methods used to derive observational 
large ensembles (McKinnon et al., 2017; McKinnon and Deser, 2018; Castruccio et al., 2019). Calibration 
methods inspired by weather and seasonal forecasts can be used to improve the reliability of regional-scale 
climate projections from large ensembles (Brunner et al., 2019; O’Reilly et al., 2020). Interestingly, 
reliability is improved when the calibration is performed separately for the dynamical and residual 
components of the ensemble resulting from dynamical adjustment (O’Reilly et al., 2020; Section 10.4.1). 
 
Importantly, accurately partitioning uncertainty in regional climate projections can provide an incentive for 
immediate action, accepting a large range of possible outcomes due to internal variability, while confounding 
model uncertainty with internal variability may be understood as a lack of knowledge and lead to delayed 
action in adaptation decision-making (Maraun, 2013; Mankin et al., 2020; Section 10.5.3). 
  
There is high confidence that the availability of SMILEs allows a robust assessment of the relative 
contributions of model uncertainty and internal variability in regional-scale projection uncertainty. There is 
high confidence that the use of SMILEs with appropriate ensemble size leads to an improved estimate of 
regional-scale forced response to an external forcing as well as of the full spectrum of possible changes 
associated with internal variability. There is high confidence that these improved estimates are beneficial for 
characterizing the full distribution of outcomes that is a key ingredient of climate information for robust 
decision-making and risk-analysis frameworks. 
 
 
### 10.3.4.4  Designing and using ensembles for regional climate change assessments to take uncertainty into account 

Ensembles of climate simulations play an important role in quantifying uncertainties in the simulation output 
(Sections 10.3.4.2 and 10.3.4.3). In addition to providing information on internal variability, ensembles of 
simulations can estimate scenario uncertainty and model (structural) uncertainty. Chapter 4, especially Box 
4.1, discusses issues involved with evaluating ensembles of GCM simulations and their uncertainties. In a 
downscaling context, further considerations are necessary, such as the selection of GCM-RCM combinations 
when performing dynamical downscaling. This is a relevant issue when resources are limited. The structural 
uncertainty of both the GCM and the downscaling method can be important (e.g., Dosio, 2017; Mearns et al., 
2012), as well as further potential uncertainty created by inconsistencies between the GCM and the 
downscaling method (e.g., Dosio et al., 2019), which could include, for example, differences in topography 
or the way to model precipitation processes (Mearns et al., 2013). 
 
An important consideration is which set of GCMs should be used for GCM-RCM combinations. If adequate 
resources exist, then large numbers of GCM-RCM combinations are possible (Déqué et al., 2012; Vautard et 
al., 2020; Coppola et al., 2021). However, coordinated downscaling programmes can be limited by the 
human and computational resources available, for producing ensembles of downscaled output, which limits 
the number of feasible GCM-RCM combinations. With this limitation in mind, a small set of GCMs may be 
chosen that span the range of equilibrium climate sensitivity in available GCMs (e.g., Inatsu et al., 2015; 
Mearns et al., 2012, 2013), though this range may be inconsistent with the likely range (Chapter 4), or some 
other relevant measure of sensitivity, such as the projected range of tropical SSTs (Suzuki-Parker et al., 
2018). A further choice is to emphasize models that do not have the same origins or that do not use similar 
parameterizations and thus might be viewed as independent, a criterion that could be applied to both GCMs 
(Chapter 4) and RCMs (Evans et al., 2014). GCMs and RCMs could also be discarded that unrealistically 
represent processes controlling the regional climate of interest (McSweeney et al., 2015; Maraun et al., 2017; 
Bukovsky et al., 2019; Eyring et al., 2019). Box 4.1 offers a more detailed discussion of the issues 
surrounding these approaches. Finally, GCMs may be selected to represent different physically self-
consistent changes in regional climate (Zappa and Shepherd, 2017). Statistical methods can provide 
estimates of outcomes from missing GCM-RCM combinations in a large matrix (Déqué et al., 2012; 
Heinrich et al., 2014; Evin et al., 2019). 
 
However, even using a relatively small set of GCMs can still involve substantial computation that strains 
available resources, both for performing the simulations and for using all simulations in the ensemble for 
further impacts assessment. The NARCCAP programme (Mearns et al., 2012) used only a subset of its 
possible GCM-RCM combinations that balanced comprehensiveness of sampling the matrix with economy 
of computation demand, while still allowing discrimination, via ANOVA methods, of GCM and RCM 
influences on regional climate change (Mearns et al., 2013). An advantage of the sparse, but balanced matrix 
for those using the downscaling output for further studies, is that they have a smaller, yet comprehensive set 
of GCM-RCM combinations to work with. Alternatively, data-clustering methods can clump together 
downscaling simulations featuring similar climate-change characteristics, so that only one representative 
simulation from each cluster may be needed for further impacts analysis, again systematically reducing the 
necessary number of simulations to work with (Mendlik and Gobiet, 2016; Wilcke and Bärring, 2016). 
 
Independently of the resources, participation of multiple models in a simulation programme such as 
CORDEX for RCMs or CMIP for GCMs creates ensembles of opportunity, which are ensembles populated 
by models that participants chose to use without there necessarily being an overarching guiding principle for 
an optimum choice. As discussed in Chapter 4, these ensembles are likely suboptimal for assessing sources 
of uncertainty. An important contributor to the suboptimal character of such an ensemble is that the models 
are not independent. Some may also have larger biases than others. Yet often, the output from models in 
these ensembles has received equal weight when viewed collectively, as was the case in much of the AR5 
assessment (e.g., Collins et al., 2013; Flato et al., 2014; Kirtman et al., 2014; Knutti et al., 2013). A number 
of emerging methodologies aim at optimizing the ensembles available by weighting the simulation results 
according to a number of criteria relevant at the regional scale that aim at obtaining more realistic estimates 
of the uncertainty (Sanderson et al., 2015; Brunner et al., 2020) 
 
There is high confidence that ensembles for regional climate projections should be selected such that models 
unrealistically simulating processes relevant for a given application are discarded, but at the same time, the 
chosen ensemble spans an appropriate range of projection uncertainties.

# 10.4  Interplay between Anthropogenic Change and Internal Variability at Regional Scales 
 
This section focuses on the assessment of the methodologies used to identify the physical causes of past and 
future regional climate change in the context of the ongoing anthropogenic influence on the global climate. 
The main foci are the attribution of past regional-scale changes (Sections 10.4.1–2) and the robustness and 
future emergence of the regional-scale response to anthropogenic forcing (Section 10.4.3). 
 
In this chapter, regional-scale attribution is defined as the process of evaluating the relative contributions of 
multiple causal factors (or drivers) to regional climate change (Cross-Working Group Box: Attribution (in 
Chapter 1); Rosenzweig and Neofotis, 2013; Shepherd, 2019). Attribution at regional scale builds upon the 
usual definition of attribution used in the AR5 (Hegerl et al., 2010; Cross-Working Group Box 1.1). 
However, in contrast with global-scale attribution methods where internal variability might be considered as 
a noise problem (Section 3.2), the preliminary detection step is not always required to perform regional-scale 
attribution since causal factors of regional climate change may also include internal modes of variability in 
addition to external natural and anthropogenic forcing. Importantly, regional-scale (or process-based) 
attribution also seeks to determine the physical processes and uncertainties involved in the causal factor’s 
influence (Cross-Working Group Box: Attribution). 
 
Section 10.4.1 describes regional-scale attribution methodologies and assesses their application to regional 
changes of temperature and precipitation. Section 10.4.2 presents three illustrative attribution examples that 
illustrate a number of specific regional-scale challenges and methodological aspects. Section 10.4.3 focuses 
on methodologies used to assess the robustness and emergence of the regional climate response to 
anthropogenic forcing. A basic description of future regional climate change for all regions considered in the 
report (as defined in Section 1.4.5) appears in the Atlas. 
 
## 10.4.1  Methodologies for Regional Climate Change Attribution  
 
Attribution at sub-continental and regional scales is usually more complicated than at the global scale due to 
various factors: a larger contribution from internal variability, an increased similarity among the responses to 
different external forcings leading to a more difficult discrimination of their effects, the importance at 
regional scale of some omitted forcings in global model simulations, and model biases related to the 
representation of small-scale phenomena (Zhai et al., 2018). Since AR5 and in addition to standard optimal 
fingerprint regression-based approaches (Section 3.2.1 and Zhai et al. 2018), several emerging 
methodologies have been increasingly used for regional-scale climate change attribution. These include 
several statistical approaches that differ in their use or omission of spatiotemporal covariance information. 
Dynamical adjustment and pattern recognition techniques fall into the category of spatiotemporal methods 
while univariate detection and attribution methods rely on single grid-point analysis. Finally, the 
development, evaluation and use of all these methodologies rely upon the availability of multiple and high-
quality observational datasets (Section 10.2) as well as multi-model simulations of the historical period 
constrained by different external forcing combinations, including single-forcing experiments and single-
model initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs). 
 
### 10.4.1.1  Optimal fingerprinting methods 
 
Optimal fingerprint regression-based methods have been applied to detection and attribution of mean 
temperature anthropogenic signal in several regions of the world such as Canada, India, Central Asia, 
Northern and Western China, Australia, and North Africa (Xu et al., 2015; Li et al., 2017a; Dileepkumar et 
al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018b; Peng et al., 2019; Wan et al., 2019). The influence of anthropogenic forcing, 
and in particular that of greenhouse gases (GHGs), is robustly detected in annual and seasonal mean 
temperatures for all considered regions. Most of the observed regional temperature changes since the mid-
twentieth century can only be explained by external forcings, with anthropogenic influence being the 
dominant factor. GHG increase is found to be the primary factor of the anthropogenic-induced warming 
while the aerosol forcing leads to a cooling offsetting a fraction of the GHG change (Li et al., 2016b, 2017a). 

While the influence of external natural forcing can often be detected as well, its contribution to observed 
changes is usually much smaller (Li et al., 2017a; Wan et al., 2019). Temperature detection results are found 
to be robust to the use of different observational data sets and detection methodologies (Dileepkumar et al., 
2018).  
 
Detection of mean precipitation changes caused by human influence is much more difficult, due to a larger 
role of internal variability at regional to local scales, as well as substantial modelling and observational 
uncertainty (Wan et al., 2015; Sarojini et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017a). However, multi-decadal precipitation 
changes due to anthropogenic forcing have been detected for several regions. Ma et al. (2017) show that 
anthropogenic forcing has strongly contributed to the observed shift of China daily precipitation towards 
heavy precipitation. The observed weakening of the East Asia summer monsoon, also known as the southern 
flooding and northern drought pattern has been partially linked to anthropogenic forcing (Section 8.3.2.4.2; 
Song et al., 2014; Tian et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2017b). Changes in GHGs lead to increasing precipitation 
over southern China, whilst changes in anthropogenic aerosols over East Asia are the dominant factors 
determining drought conditions over northern China (Song et al., 2014; Tian et al., 2018). Based on all-
forcing and single-forcing simulation ensembles with a high-resolution model, Delworth and Zeng (2014) 
found that the observed long-term regional austral autumn and winter rainfall decline over southern and 
particularly southwest Australia is partially reproduced in response to anthropogenic changes in GHGs and 
ozone in the atmosphere, whereas anthropogenic aerosols do not contribute to the simulated precipitation 
decline. In contrast, the observed increase of northwest Australian summertime rainfall since 1950 has been 
partially attributed to anthropogenic aerosol based on CMIP5 detection and attribution single-forcing 
simulations (Section 8.3.2.4.6; Dey et al., 2019b, 2019a). 
  
It is noteworthy that these methods require a very significant reduction of spatial and temporal dimensions in 
order to reliably estimate the covariance matrix of internal variability (an entire region is thus often 
considered as being only one or a few spatial points that represent the spatial average of the whole region or 
a few sub-regions; time samples are often 5- or 10-year averages). Finally, model bias is rarely considered in 
statistical models used in detection and attribution regional studies, while it has been shown to have a strong 
impact on the stability of detection results and their associated confidence intervals when increasing the 
spatial dimension (Ribes and Terray, 2013). New statistical methods are emerging to provide some 
alternative to standard optimal fingerprinting but they have not yet been evaluated and applied at regional 
scales (Section 3.2.2). 
 
### 10.4.1.2   Other spatiotemporal statistical methods for isolating regional climate responses to external forcing 

 
The primary objective of any attribution method is to optimally separate the influences of external forcing 
and internal variability on a global or regional climate record. In a multi-model ensemble context, the 
estimation of the externally-forced climate response has been typically performed by ensemble averaging of 
linear trends or regional domain spatial average, thus not taking into account the available and complete 
space and time covariance information. Since AR5, methods using spatiotemporal information have been 
further developed and used to improve the separation between external and internal drivers in multiple or 
single historical climate realizations performed by a given global model. 
 
The typical ensemble size of CMIP historical climate simulations for a given model traditionally ranges 
between one and ten members, with three often being the default choice. At the regional scale, a simple 
ensemble average with such sample sizes does not provide robust estimates of the response patterns to 
external forcing (Maher et al., 2019; Deser et al., 2020). Since AR5, pattern filtering methods such as signal-
to-noise maximizing empirical orthogonal functions (Ting et al., 2009) have been shown to improve the 
identification of forced response patterns when only few model members are available (Wills et al., 2020). 
Using SMILEs as a test bed, it has been shown that pattern filtering strongly reduces the number of ensemble 
members needed to estimate the forced response pattern compared to simple ensemble averaging. Pattern 
filtering allows the identification of low signal-to-noise signals such as the El Niño-like response to volcanic 
eruptions (Khodri et al., 2017; Wills et al., 2020). 
 
Methods to extract the response to external forcing in an observed or simulated single realization include 
dynamical adjustment (Smoliak et al., 2015; Deser et al., 2016; Sippel et al., 2019) and time-scale separation 
methods (DelSole et al., 2011; Wills et al., 2018, 2020). Dynamical adjustment seeks to isolate changes in 
surface air temperature or precipitation that are due purely to atmospheric circulation changes. The residual 
can then be analysed and attributed to internal changes in both land or ocean surface conditions and the 
thermodynamical response to external forcing. Smoliak et al. (2015) performed their dynamical adjustment 
using partial least squares regression of temperature to remove variations arising from sea-level pressure 
changes. Deser et al. (2016) used constructed atmospheric circulation analogues and resampling to estimate 
the dynamical contribution to changes in temperature. Sippel et al. (2019) used machine learning techniques 
known as regularized linear regression to provide estimates of circulation-induced components of 
precipitation and temperature variability from global to local scales. It is noteworthy that the dynamical 
adjustment method by itself cannot account for the component of the forced response associated with 
circulation changes that project onto atmospheric internal variability. However, this component can be 
estimated within a model framework by averaging the dynamical contribution across multiple members of a 
SMILE (Deser et al., 2016). 
 
Dynamical adjustment methods have been used by, for instance, Deser et al. (2016), Saffioti et al. (2016), 
O’Reilly et al. (2017), Gong et al. (2019), and Guo et al. (2019). Deser et al. (2016) focused on the causes of 
observed and simulated multi-decadal trends in North American temperature. They demonstrated that the 
main advantage of this technique is to narrow the spread of temperature trends found by the model ensemble 
and to bring the dynamically-adjusted observational trend much closer to the forced response estimated by 
the model ensemble mean. Similar results were obtained by Saffioti et al. (2016) regarding recent observed 
winter temperature and precipitation trends over Europe. Similarly, O’Reilly et al. (2017) applied dynamical 
adjustment techniques to more carefully determine the influence of the Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability 
(AMV; Annex AIV.2.7) on continental climates. Over Europe, summer temperature anomalies induced 
thermodynamically by the warm phase of the AMV are further reinforced by circulation anomalies; 
meanwhile, precipitation signals are largely controlled by dynamical responses to the AMV. Based on a 
partial least-squares approach, Gong et al. (2019) showed that recent winter temperature 30-year trends over 
northern East Asia are strongly influenced by internal variability linked to decadal changes of the Arctic 
Oscillation. Using dynamical adjustment purely on precipitation observations, Guo et al. (2019) showed that 
human influence has led to increased wintertime precipitation across north-eastern North America, as well as 
a small region of north-western North America, and to an increase in precipitation across much of north-
western and north central Eurasia. The latter results confirm previous findings obtained by standard optimal 
fingerprinting methods (Wan et al., 2015). 
 
Time-scale separation methods such as the low-frequency component analysis and ensemble empirical mode 
decomposition methods take advantage of the longer time scale associated with anthropogenic external 
forcing compared to that of most internal modes of variability. The low-frequency component analysis 
method tries to find low-frequency variability patterns by searching for linear combinations of a moderate 
number of empirical orthogonal functions that maximize the ratio of low-frequency to total variance. It has 
first been used to separate internal modes of interannual and decadal variability from slowly varying and 
externally-forced variability in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (Wills et al., 2018, 2019). The methodology 
has also been applied to patterns of observed surface air temperature to isolate the slow components of 
observed changes that are consistent with the expected response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas and 
aerosol forcing (Wills et al., 2020). 
 
The ensemble empirical mode decomposition method (Wu and Huang, 2009; Wilcox et al., 2013; Ji et al., 
2014; Qian and Zhou, 2014) decomposes data, such as time series of historical temperature and precipitation, 
into independent oscillatory modes of decreasing frequency. The last step of the method leaves behind a 
smooth and low-frequency residual time series. Typically, the nonlinear anthropogenic trend (e.g., of 20th-
century temperature) can be reconstructed by summing the long-term mean, the residual, and eventually the 
lowest-frequency mode to account for a multi-decadal forced signal, for instance associated with 
anthropogenic aerosol forcing. The ensemble empirical mode decomposition method is an example of a data-
driven, non-parametric approach that can be used to directly provide an estimate of the forced response 
without the need for model data (Qian, 2016). 
 
 
### 10.4.1.3  Other regional-scale attribution approaches 
 
The univariate detection method does not use spatial pattern information, but compares observed trends in 
gridded datasets with distributions of trends from ensembles of simulations during the historical period 
(Knutson et al., 2013; Knutson and Zeng, 2018). The trends arising from simulations constrained by natural 
forcing-only and all-forcing are compared with distributions of trends purely due to internal variability and 
derived from long simulations with constant pre-industrial external forcing. Consistency between observed 
and simulated historical trends is also assessed with statistical tests that can be applied independently over a 
large number of grid points. The fraction of area over a given region where the change is classified as 
detectable, attributable, or consistent/inconsistent, is then finally estimated. The method can be viewed as a 
simple consistency test for both amplitude and pattern of observed versus simulated trends. Its application to 
CMIP3 and CMIP5 models suggests that 80% of the Earth’s surface has a detectable anthropogenic warming 
signal (Knutson et al., 2013). Regarding regional land precipitation changes over the 1901–2010 and 1951–
2010 periods, application of the univariate detection method based on CMIP5 models suggests attributable 
anthropogenic changes at several locations such as increases over regions of the north-central United States, 
southern Canada, Europe, and southern South America and decreases over parts of the Mediterranean region, 
northern tropical Africa and southwestern Australia (Knutson and Zeng, 2018). 
 
Another regional attribution technique is based on the similarity of past changes between observations and 
one or several simulations of a large ensemble that share the same time evolution for a suggested driver of 
these changes. Huang et al. (2020) used a perturbed physics ensemble to attribute the drying trend of the 
Indian monsoon over the latter half of the 20th century to decadal forcing from the Pacific Decadal 
Variability (PDV; Annex AIV.2.6). The ensemble members predicted different trends in PDV behaviour 
across the 20th century and the negative precipitation trend was only replicated in those members with a 
strong negative-to-positive PDV transition across the 1970s, consistent with the observed PDV behaviour 
(see also the detailed case study in Section 10.6). In a similar manner, Cvijanovic et al. (2017) addressed the 
possible influence of Arctic sea-ice loss on the North Pacific pressure ridge and, consequently, on south-
western United States precipitation. They sampled the uncertainties in selected sea-ice physics parameters to 
achieve a “low Arctic sea-ice” state in their perturbed simulations. They then compared the latter with 
control simulations representative of sea-ice conditions at the end of the 20th century to assess changes 
purely due to sea-ice loss. 
 
New methods aiming to remove underlying model biases before performing detection and attribution, for 
instance related to precipitation changes, are emerging based on image transformation techniques such as 
warping (Levy et al., 2014a). By correcting location and seasonal precipitation biases in CMIP5 models, 
Levy et al. (2014b) showed that the agreement between observed and fingerprint patterns can be improved, 
further enhancing the ability to attribute observed precipitation changes to external forcings. The 
improvement mainly relies on the assumption that precipitation changes are tied to the underlying 
climatology, which has been shown to be a reasonable assumption in regions of the world where 
intensification of the hydrological cycle is expected (Held and Soden, 2006). 
 
Importantly, evidence that the models employed in regional-scale attribution are fit for purpose is essential in 
order to estimate the degree of confidence in the attribution results (Section 10.3.3). For example, models 
need to be evaluated and assessed in their ability to simulate internal variability modes that are known to be 
important drivers of regional climate change (Sections 3.7 and 10.3.3.3 and Annexes AIV.2 and AIV.3).  
Models are likely to have different performance in different regions and therefore their evaluation needs to 
be performed in terms of key physical processes and mechanisms relevant to the climate of the region under 
consideration (Section 10.3.3). 
 
To conclude, there is very high confidence (robust evidence and high agreement) that the use of diverse and 
independent attribution methods, multiple model ensemble types and observed datasets strengthens the 
robustness of results of regional-scale attribution studies. Since AR5, multiple SMILEs have provided an  
adequate testbed for new attribution methodologies aimed at separating forced signals from internal 
variability in observational records as well as small-size single-model ensembles.  
  
 
## 10.4.2  Regional Climate Change Attribution Examples 
 
This section focuses on three illustrative examples that span different regions, time scales, attribution 
methods, without aiming at being comprehensive. These examples illustrate attribution statements that are 
based upon multiple lines of evidence, combining multiple observational data sets, different generations and 
types of models, process understanding and assessment of various sources of uncertainty. Detection and 
attribution assessments for all AR6 regions and specific variables can be found in the Atlas. 
 
 
### 10.4.2.1  The Sahel and West African monsoon drought and recovery 
 
The Sahel, fed by the West African monsoon, has experienced severe decadal rainfall variations (Figure 
10.11a). Abundant rainfall in the 1950s–1960s was followed by a large negative trend (Figure 10.11b) until 
at least the 1980s, over which annual rainfall fell by 20–30% (Hulme, 2001). The subsequent partial 
recovery (Wang et al., 2020) is more uncertain: rain-gauge studies suggest a return to long-term positive 
anomalies in the western Sahel in the early 2000s (Panthou et al., 2018), while CHIRPS merged 
satellite/gauge data show a wetter western Sahel since 1981 (Bichet and Diedhiou, 2018b, 2018a). The 
recovery has been more significant over the central rather than the western Sahel (Lebel and Ali, 2009; 
Sanogo et al., 2015; Maidment et al., 2015) and a multiple-gauge record supports a greater recovery to the 
eastern side (Nicholson et al., 2018). In this attribution example, drivers of the long-term drought and 
subsequent partial recovery are discussed, including anthropogenic GHG and aerosol emissions, and sea 
surface temperature (SST) variations that, in part, relate to internal variability. The reader is also referred to 
assessment in Section 8.3.2.4. We define the Sahel within 10°N‒20°N across to 30°E, consistent with the 
eastern boundary used in Chapter 8, and the rainy season as spanning June to September. 
 
<figref>10.11</figref> 
 
The role of SST forcing in the rainfall decline is assessed first. Competing mechanisms from equatorial 
Atlantic SSTs and interhemispheric SST gradients regulate decadal variability in the Sahel (Nicholson, 
2013), alternatively explained by tropical warming leading to Sahel drought, while North Atlantic warming 
promotes increased rainfall (Rodríguez-Fonseca et al., 2015). The SST influence has been formalised in an 
AMV framework (Giannini et al., 2013; Martin and Thorncroft, 2014; Martin et al., 2014; Park et al., 2015), 
suggesting that relative North Atlantic SST warming increases the Northern Hemisphere differential 
warming, enhancing Sahel rainfall. The AMV influence is supported by CMIP5 initialized decadal hindcasts 
(Gaetani and Mohino, 2013; Mohino et al., 2016; Sheen et al., 2017), which outperform empirical 
predictions based on persistence. Some caution is needed since the full magnitude of internal variability is 
not captured in most CMIP5 models, as poor resolution prevents reproduction of AMV teleconnection 
responses (Vellinga et al., 2016), and the magnitude of AMV-related SST variation may be underestimated 
in CMIP5 (Section 3.7.7, which also assesses that the AMV may be partially forced). The influence of PDV 
has been studied to a lesser extent, with the PDV positive phase having a negative impact on Sahel rainfall in 
combined observational/CMIP5 analysis (Villamayor and Mohino, 2015). The closer match between the 
observed rainfall declining trend and those in an atmosphere-only SMILE, in which SSTs are matched to 
observations, compared to three coupled SMILEs in which they are not, suggests that the underlying ocean 
surface might be essential in driving the decline (Figure 10.11e). 
 
In terms of anthropogenic emissions, regional aerosol emissions from Europe, and to a lesser extent from 
Asia, have been shown in a global model to weaken Sahel precipitation either through a weakened Saharan 
heat low or via the Walker circulation (Dong et al., 2014). Greenhouse gases (GHGs) and anthropogenic 
aerosol can be considered together to control ITCZ position based on temperature asymmetry at the 
hemispheric scale. GHGs increase Sahel precipitation, while aerosol reduces it (in coupled slab-ocean model 
experiments by Ackerley et al., 2011 following Biasutti and Giannini, 2006). This effect is stronger when 
models account for aerosol-cloud interactions (Allen et al., 2015). Perturbed physics GCM ensembles 
suggests that aerosol emissions were the main driver of observed drying over 1950–1980 (Ackerley et al., 
2011), supported by CMIP5 single-forcing experiments (Polson et al., 2014). A coherent drying signal in 
CMIP5 over the extended 1901–2010 period has also been found, although smaller than the observed trend 
(Knutson and Zeng, 2018). By applying aerosol scaling factors to the historical period in order to sample the 
uncertainty in CMIP5 aerosol radiative forcing, Shonk et al. (2020) found differences of 0.5 mm day-1 for 
Gulf of Guinea rainfall between strong and weak aerosol experiments as illustrated in Figure 10.11c, 
although the drying appears further south than observed due to model bias. 
 
For the partial recovery in West African monsoon and Sahel rainfall since the late 1980s, a detection study 
using three reanalyses (Cook and Vizy, 2015) shows a connection to increasing Saharan temperatures at a 
rate 2–4 times greater than the tropical mean, also confirmed by multiple observational and satellite-based 
data (Zhou and Wang, 2016; Vizy and Cook, 2017) and the review of Cook and Vizy (2019). Reanalyses are 
also noted to significantly underestimate the Saharan warming (Zhou and Wang, 2016). Saharan warming 
causes a stronger thermal low and more intense monsoon flow, providing more moisture to the central and 
eastern Sahel, supported by CMIP5 models (Lavaysse et al., 2016), although not all models capture the 
observed rainfall/heat low relationship. Sahel rainfall is also incorrectly located in prototype versions of a 
few CMIP6 models, related to tropospheric temperature biases (Martin et al., 2017). Amplified Saharan 
warming has increased the wind shear, leading to a tripling of extreme storms since 1982, which may 
partially explain the recovery (Taylor et al., 2017). Instead, observations, multiple models and SST-
sensitivity experiments with atmospheric GCMs have suggested that stronger Mediterranean Sea evaporation 
enhances low-level moisture convergence to the Sahel, increasing rainfall (Park et al., 2016). Meanwhile, an 
atmospheric GCM study suggested that GHGs alone (in the absence of SST warming) could cause Sahel 
rainfall recovery, with an additional role for anthropogenic aerosol (Dong and Sutton, 2015); recent changes 
in North Atlantic SSTs, although substantial, did not exert a significant impact on the recovery. Large spread 
in the recovery in a five-member atmospheric GCM ensemble suggests that atmospheric internal variability 
cannot be discounted (Roehrig et al., 2013). 
 
Consistent timing of the southward ITCZ shift during the decline period in CMIP3 and CMIP5 historical 
simulations supports the role of external forcing, chiefly anthropogenic aerosol (Hwang et al., 2013). The 
evolution of the observed decline and recovery is largely followed by the CMIP5 multi-model mean, further 
supporting the role of external drivers (Giannini and Kaplan, 2019). Updated results from CMIP6 for 
historical simulations with all and single forcings are represented in Figure 10.11d,e, showing smaller trends 
than those observed. Giannini and Kaplan (2019) attempted to unify the driving mechanisms for decline and 
recovery based on singular-value decomposition of observed and modelled SSTs. Since the 1950s, tropical 
warming arising from GHGs and North Atlantic cooling from aerosol led to regional stabilization, 
suppressing Sahel rainfall. The subsequent reduction in aerosol emissions then led to North Atlantic 
warming and recovery of Sahel rainfall. Such mechanisms continue into the near-term future in idealised and 
modified RCP experiments, with scenarios featuring more aggressive reductions in aerosol emissions, or 
including aerosol-cloud interactions, favouring a greater northward shift of rainfall (Allen, 2015; Westervelt 
et al., 2017, 2018; Scannell et al., 2019). There is paleoclimate evidence of changes to Sahel rainfall in the 
past, in particular with enhancement of the West African monsoon during the mid-Holocene. However, the 
mechanisms governing such a change have been shown to be largely dynamical in nature (D’Agostino et al., 
2019), suggesting that the mid-Holocene cannot be used to inform the credibility of changes due to 
greenhouse warming. 
 
There is very high confidence (robust evidence and high agreement) that patterns of 20th-century ocean and 
land surface temperature variability have caused the Sahel drought and subsequent recovery by adjusting 
meridional gradients. There is high confidence (robust evidence and medium agreement) that the changing 
temperature gradients that perturb the West African monsoon and Sahel rainfall are themselves driven by 
anthropogenic emissions: warming by GHG emissions was initially restricted to the tropics but suppressed in 
the North Atlantic due to nearby emissions of sulphate aerosols, leading to a reduction in rainfall. The North 
Atlantic subsequently warmed following the reduction of aerosol emissions, leading to rainfall recovery. 
 
 
### 10.4.2.2  The southeastern South America summer wetting 
 
A positive trend in summer (December to February) precipitation has been detected in multiple observational 
sources in southeastern South America since the beginning of the 20th century (Gonzalez et al., 2013; Vera 
and Díaz, 2015; Wu et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016; Díaz and Vera, 2017; Saurral et al., 2017). Sedimentary 
records from the Mar Chiquita lake indicate that the last quarter of the 20th century was wetter than any 
period during the last 200 years (Piovano et al., 2004). In this attribution example the drivers contributing to 
the positive trend for the period 1951–2014 are discussed (Figure 10.12a). Precipitation anomalies of CRU 
TS as well as for the two members of a SMILE with the most negative and positive trends for 1951–2014 are 
displayed in Figure 10.12b. The trend for 1951–2014 using CRU TS and GPCC is illustrated in Figure 
10.12c, and for the region defined by the black quadrilateral, it amounts to 2.8 (CRU TS) – 3.5 (GPCC) mm 
per month and decade (see black crosses in Figure 10.12d) while the mean summer monthly precipitation for 
the same period is 104 (CRU TS) ‒109 (GPCC) mm. The trend is also detectable in daily and monthly 
extremes (Re and Barros, 2009; Marengo et al., 2010; Penalba and Robledo, 2010; Doyle et al., 2012; Donat 
et al., 2013; Lorenz et al., 2016). 
 
<figref>10.12</figref> 
 
The influence of SST anomalies on southeastern South America precipitation have been studied extensively 
on interannual to multi-decadal time scales (Paegle and Mo, 2002). The positive phase of El Niño Southern 
Oscillation (ENSO; Annex AIV.2.3) is related to stronger mean and extreme rainfall over south-eastern 
South America (Ropelewski and Halpert, 1987; Grimm and Tedeschi, 2009; Robledo et al., 2016). The 
ENSO influence may be modulated by the PDV (Kayano and Andreoli, 2007; Fernandes and Rodrigues, 
2018) and the AMV (Kayano and Capistrano, 2014). PDV and AMV also influence the southeastern South 
American climate independently of ENSO (Barreiro et al., 2014; Grimm and Saboia, 2015; Robledo et al., 
2019). While Pacific SSTs dominate the overall influence of oceanic variability in the region, the Atlantic 
variability seems to dominate on multi-decadal time scales and has been proposed as a driver for the long-
term positive trend (Seager et al., 2010; Barreiro et al., 2014). Based on experiments designed to test how 
southeastern South America precipitation is modulated by tropical Atlantic SSTs, Seager et al. (2010) 
showed that cold anomalies in the tropical Atlantic favour wetter conditions by inducing an upper-
tropospheric flow towards the equator, which, via advection of vorticity, leads to ascending motion over 
southeastern South America (Figure 10.12a). Monerie et al. (2019) supported this argument showing a 
negative relationship between southeastern South America precipitation and the AMV index (Huang et al., 
2015) using an atmospheric GCM coupled to an ocean mixed layer model with nudged SSTs.  
 
The positive trend of precipitation has also been attributed to anthropogenic GHG emissions and 
stratospheric ozone depletion. CMIP5 models only show a positive trend when including anthropogenic 
forcings (Vera and Díaz, 2015). These results were supported by Knutson and Zeng (2018) based on 
univariate detection/attribution analysis of annual-mean trends for the 1901–2010 and 1951–2010 periods. 
However, the main features of summer mean precipitation and variability of South America are still not well 
represented in all CMIP5 and CMIP6 models (Gulizia and Camilloni, 2015; Díaz and Vera, 2017; Díaz et al., 
2020). This motivates the construction of ensembles that exclude the worst performing models (Section 
10.3.3.4). The construction of ensembles of CMIP5 historical simulations with realistic representation of 
precipitation anomalies with opposite sign over southeastern South America and eastern Brazil showed that 
the trend since the 1950s could be related to changes in precipitation characteristics only when simulations 
included anthropogenic forcings (Díaz and Vera, 2017). GHG emissions have been related to increased 
precipitation in southeastern South America through three different mechanisms (Figure 10.12a). First, GHG 
warming induces a non-zonally uniform pattern of SST warming that includes a warming pattern over the 
Indian and Pacific Oceans that excites wave responses over South America (Junquas et al., 2013). Zonally 
uniform SST patterns of warming alone lead to precipitation signals opposite to those observed in an 
atmospheric GCM (Junquas et al., 2013). Second, GHG radiative forcing drives an expansion of the Hadley 
cell so that its descending branch moves poleward from the region, generating anomalous ascending motion 
and precipitation (Zhang et al., 2016b; Saurral et al., 2019). The third mechanism by which increased GHG 
can contribute to increased precipitation in the region is through a delay of the stratospheric polar vortex 
breakdown. As depicted in Figure 10.12a, both stratospheric ozone depletion and increased GHGs have 
contributed to the later breakdown of the polar vortex in recent decades (Ceppi and Shepherd, 2019; 
McLandress et al., 2010; Wu and Polvani, 2017). Mindlin et al. (2020) developed future atmospheric 
circulation storylines (Section 10.3.4.2, Box 10.2) for Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes with the CMIP5 
models and found that for southeastern South America summer precipitation, increases are related to the late 
springtime breakdown of the stratospheric polar vortex. The connecting mechanism is through a lagged 
southward shift of the jet stream (Saggioro and Shepherd, 2019), which enhances cyclonic activity over the 
region (Wu and Polvani, 2017). 
 
A common feature among the above discussed studies is that even if GCMs simulate positive trends when 
forced with GHG and/or stratospheric ozone, these trends are in general smaller than those observed (e.g., 
CMIP6 trends in red open circles in Figure 10.12d). Díaz et al. (2020) showed that to capture the observed 
trend a multi-model ensemble of SMILEs is needed. Out of the 12 large ensembles examined (with ensemble 
size varying in the 16‒100 range), only seven simulated the observed trend within their range. This could 
partly be explained by model biases in mean precipitation and its interannual variability. In the sub-ensemble 
of six models that reproduce reasonably well the observed spatial patterns of mean precipitation and 
interannual variability, the ensemble mean spread is lower, and the forced response, taken as the multi-model 
ensemble mean, is slightly more positive than that of the six poorly performing models. The signal to noise 
ratio, estimated as the ratio of the forced response to the spread due to internal variability, is also slightly 
higher for the best-performing models, suggesting that selecting the best-performing models may have an 
influence on both attribution of the observed trend and emergence of the forced response in future (Section 
10.4.3). 
 
There is high confidence that southeastern South America summer precipitation has increased since the 
beginning of the 20th century. Since AR5, science has advanced in the identification of the drivers of the 
precipitation increase in southeastern South America since 1950, including GHG through various 
mechanisms, stratospheric ozone depletion and Pacific and Atlantic variability. There is high confidence that 
anthropogenic forcing has contributed to the southeastern South America summer precipitation increase 
since 1950, but very low confidence on the relative contribution of each driver to the precipitation increase. 
 
 
### 10.4.2.3   The southwestern North America drought 
 
Persistent hydroclimatic drought in southwestern North America remains a much-studied event. Drought is a 
regular feature of the southwestern North America’s climate regime, as can be seen in both the modern 
record, and through paleoclimate reconstructions (Cook et al., 2010; Woodhouse et al., 2010; Williams et al., 
2020), as well as in future climate model projections (Cook et al., 2015a). Since the early 1980s, which were 
relatively wet in terms of precipitation and streamflow, the region has experienced major multiyear droughts 
such as the turn-of-the-century drought that lasted from 1999 to 2005, and the most recent and extreme 
2012–2014 drought that in certain locations is perhaps unprecedented in the last millennium (Griffin and 
Anchukaitis, 2014; Robeson, 2015; Section 8.3.1.6). Shorter dry spells also happened between these 
multiyear droughts making 1980 to present a period with an exceptionally steep trend from wet to dry 
(Figure 10.13a), leading to strong declines in Rio Grande and Colorado river flows (Lehner et al., 2017b; 
Udall and Overpeck, 2017). While robust attribution of this trend is complicated by the large natural 
variability in this region, the 20th century warming has been suggested to increase the chances for 
hydrological drought periods by lowering runoff efficiency (Woodhouse et al., 2016; Lehner et al., 2017b; 
Woodhouse and Pederson, 2018) and affecting evapotranspiration (Williams et al., 2020). There is some 
evidence suggesting that the Last Glacial Maximum, a period of low atmospheric CO2, ~21 ka ago, has a 
thermodynamically-driven zonal mean precipitation response similar to that of the current state with 
relatively high CO2 levels when compared with the pre-industrial period. Pluvial conditions at that time and 
a reduction in precipitation from the Last Glacial Maximum to the pre-industrial period are consistent with 
drying trends for the region in models with GHG concentrations exceeding pre-industrial levels. However, 
the dominant large-scale drivers responsible for the precipitation changes observed during these two 
transitions are markedly different: mainly ice sheet retreat and increasing insolation on one hand, increasing 
GHGs on the other hand. This suggests that the Last Glacial Maximum correspondence is fortuitous which 
strongly limits its use to capture future hydrological cycle changes (Morrill et al., 2018; Lowry and Morrill, 
2019; Section 8.3.2.4.4). Furthermore, the conclusion of the Last Glacial Maximum drying versus wetting 
seems to strongly depend on the physical property of interest, hydrologic or vegetation indicators (Scheff et 
al., 2017). Droughts are characterized by deficits in total soil moisture content that can be caused by a 
combination of decreasing precipitation and warming temperature, which promotes greater 
evapotranspiration. Regional-scale attribution of the prevalence of southwestern North America drought 
since 1980 then mostly focuses on the attribution of change in these two variables. 
 
The observed southwestern North America drying fits the narrative of what might happen in response to 
increasing GHG concentrations due to a poleward expansion of the subtropics, that is conducive to drying 
trends over subtropical to mid-latitude regions (Hu et al., 2013b; Birner et al., 2014; Lucas et al., 2014). 
However, several studies based on modern reanalyses and CMIP5 models have recently shown that the 
current contribution of GHGs to Northern Hemisphere tropical expansion is much smaller than in the 
Southern Hemisphere and will remain difficult to detect due to large internal variability, even by the end of 
the 21st century (Section 3.3.3.1; Garfinkel et al., 2015; Allen and Kovilakam, 2017; Grise et al., 2018, 
2019). In addition, the widening of the Northern Hemisphere tropical belt exhibits strong seasonality and 
zonal asymmetry, particularly in autumn and the North Atlantic (Amaya et al., 2018; Grise et al., 2018). 
Therefore, it seems that the recent Northern Hemisphere tropical expansion results from the interplay of 
internal and forced modes of tropical width variations and that the forced response has not robustly emerged 
from internal variability (Section 3.3.3.1; Section 10.4.3). 
 
A second possible causal factor is the role for ocean-forced or internal atmospheric circulation change. 
Analysis of observed and CMIP5-simulated precipitation indicates that the drought prevalence since 1980 is 
linked to natural, internal variability in the climate system (Knutson and Zeng, 2018). Based on observations 
and ensembles of SST-driven atmospheric simulations, Seager and Hoerling (2014) suggested that robust 
tropical Pacific and tropical North Atlantic forcing drove an important fraction of annual mean precipitation 
and soil moisture changes and that early 21st century multiyear droughts could be attributed to natural 
decadal swings in tropical Pacific and North Atlantic SSTs. A cold state of the tropical Pacific would lead by 
well-established atmospheric teleconnections to anomalous high pressure across the North Pacific and 
southern North America, favouring a weaker jet stream and a diversion of the Pacific storm track away from 
the southwest (Delworth et al., 2015; Seager and Ting, 2017). The multiyear drought of 2012–2016 has been 
linked to the multiyear persistence of anomalously high atmospheric pressure over the north-eastern Pacific 
Ocean, which deflected the Pacific storm track northward and suppressed regional precipitation during 
California's rainy season (Swain et al., 2017). Going into more detail, Prein et al. (2016) used an assessment 
of changing occurrence of weather regimes to judge that changes in the frequency of certain regimes during 
1979–2014 have led to a decline in precipitation by about 25%, chiefly related to the prevalence of 
anticyclonic circulation patterns in the northeast Pacific. Finally, the moderate model performance in 
representing Pacific SST decadal variability and its remote influence (Section 3.7.6) as well as its change 
under warming may affect attribution results of observed and future precipitation changes (Seager et al., 
2019). 
 
It has also been suggested that the ocean-controlled influence is limited and internal atmospheric variability 
has to be invoked to fully explain the observed history of drought on decadal time scales (Seager and 
Hoerling, 2014; Seager and Ting, 2017). From roughly 1980 to the present, the regional climate signals show 
an interesting mix between forced and internal variability. Lehner et al. (2018) used a dynamical adjustment 
method and large ensembles of coupled and SST-forced atmospheric experiments to suggest that the 
observed southwestern North America rainfall decline mainly results from the effects of atmospheric internal 
variability, which is in part driven by a PDV-related phase shift in Pacific SST around 2000 (Figure 10.13b, 
c). Based upon four SMILEs (three using a coupled GCM and another one an atmospheric GCM constrained 
by observed SSTs) and a CMIP6 multi-model suite constrained by observed external forcings, Figure 10.13 
shows, in agreement with Lehner et al. (2018), that observed SSTs with their associated atmospheric 
response are the main drivers of the southwestern North America precipitation decrease during the 1983‒
2014 period. Once aspects of the internal variability are removed by dynamical adjustment, the observed 
precipitation-change signal and simulated anthropogenically-forced components look more similar (Lehner 
et al., 2018).  
 
<figref>10.13</figref> 
 
Importantly, as the AR6 assessment views the PDV as being mostly driven by internal variability (Section 
3.7.6), the lines of evidence cited above suggest that the contribution of natural and anthropogenic forcings 
to the precipitation decline has a small amplitude. Unlike the precipitation deficit, the accompanying 
southwestern North America warming is driven primarily by anthropogenic forcing from GHGs rather than 
atmospheric circulation variability and may help to enhance the drought through increased 
evapotranspiration (Knutson et al., 2013; Diffenbaugh et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2015, 2020, Lehner et al., 
2018, 2020). 
 
To conclude, there is high confidence (robust evidence and medium agreement) that most (>50%) of the 
anomalous atmospheric circulation that caused the southwestern North America negative precipitation trend 
can be attributed to teleconnections arising from tropical Pacific SST variations related to PDV. There is 
high confidence (robust evidence and medium agreement) that anthropogenic forcing has made a substantial 
contribution (~50%) to the southwestern North America warming since 1980. 
 
### 10.4.2.4  Assessment summary 
 
The robustness of regional-scale attribution differs strongly between temperature and precipitation changes. 
While the influence of anthropogenic forcing on regional temperature long-term change has been detected 
and attributed in almost all land regions, a robust detection and attribution of human influence on regional 
precipitation change has not yet fully occurred for many land regions (Section 10.4.3). Although the 
contribution of anthropogenic forcing to long-term regional precipitation change has been detected in some 
regions, a robust quantification of the contributions of different drivers remains elusive. The delayed 
emergence of the anthropogenic precipitation fingerprint with respect to temperature is likely due to the 
opposing sign of the fast and slow land precipitation forced responses and time-dependent SST change 
patterns (Section 8.2.1; Section 10.4.3), stronger internal variability (Section 10.3.4.3) as well as larger 
observational uncertainty (Section 10.2) and impact of model biases. The contribution of internal variability 
to the observed changes can also be very sensitive to the period length and level of spatial aggregation for 
the region under scrutiny (Kumar et al., 2016; Cross-Chapter Box 3.1; Section 4.4.1). Finally, even in the 
case of temperature changes at multi-decadal time scale, internal variability can still be a substantial driver of 
regional changes due to cancellation between different external forcings (Nath et al., 2018). 
 
To conclude, it is virtually certain (robust evidence and high agreement) that anthropogenic forcing has been 
a major driver of temperature change since 1950 in many sub-continental regions of the world. There is high 
confidence (high evidence and medium agreement) that anthropogenic forcing has contributed to multi-
decadal mean precipitation changes in several regions such as for example West Africa, southeast South 
America, southwestern Australia, northern Central Eurasia, South and East Asia. However, at regional scale, 
the role of internal variability is stronger while uncertainties in observations, models and external forcing are 
all larger than at the global scale, precluding a robust assessment of the magnitude of the relative 
contributions of greenhouse gases, including stratospheric ozone, and different aerosol species. 
 
 
## 10.4.3  Future Regional Changes: Robustness and Emergence of the Anthropogenic Signal 
 
Regional climate projections are one key element of the multiple lines of evidence that are used for climate 
risk assessments as well as for adaptation and policy decisions at regional scales (Sections 10.3.3.9 and 
10.5). Regional climate projections can be separated into two components: the regional-scale forced response 
or regional-scale climate sensitivity when normalized by the global mean temperature change (Seneviratne 
and Hauser, 2020) and the climate internal variability characterizing the future period or global warming 
level under scrutiny. This section assesses a few methodological aspects related to robustness and emergence 
properties of the regional-scale forced response as well as the possible influence of internal variability on the 
emergence of the anthropogenic signal. 
 
 
### 10.4.3.1  Robustness of the anthropogenic signal at regional scale 
 
Standard methodologies to derive the regional forced response include pattern scaling and the time-shift or 
epoch approach (Tebaldi and Arblaster, 2014; Vautard et al., 2014; Herger et al., 2015; Tebaldi and Knutti, 
2018; Christensen et al., 2019; Section 4.2.4). Pattern scaling assumes that the spatial patterns of regional 
change, often based on a time-averaged 20 or 30-year period at the end of the 21st century, are roughly 
constant in time, and simply scale linearly with global mean warming. The time-shift approach defines a 
target in terms of global warming level (GWL) and locates the time segment, usually 20 or 30 years, in 
historical or scenario simulations in which global mean warming matches the required GWL (Section 10.1.2; 
Cross-Chapter Box 11.1). Physical consistency between multiple variables and space-time covariance are 
fully preserved in the time-shift approach, which is not the case for pattern-scaling (Herger et al., 2015). 
Importantly, pattern scaling cannot account for the non-linearity arising from either interacting quasi-linear 
processes (Chadwick and Good, 2013) and purely nonlinear mechanisms, which have been shown to be 
present in CMIP5 models for high GWL (4°C) and affect precipitation more than temperature at the 
regional-scale (Good et al., 2015, 2016; Section 8.5.3.1). The time-shift approach can also be used to test 
whether regional climate change patterns depend on the rate of global mean warming and external forcing 
pathways, in addition to global warming magnitude. A global evaluation of both approaches in projecting the 
forced temperature and precipitation response for a highly mitigated scenario based on a moderately 
mitigated one has been performed using a perfect-model framework (Tebaldi and Knutti, 2018). The 
amplitude of errors for both approaches appears to be substantially smaller than model uncertainty 
approximated by the CMIP5 multi-model spread. 
 
Based on large and coordinated modelling exercises such as CMIP5 and CORDEX, the time-shift approach 
has been largely used to assess differences in regional climate impacts for different GWLs, with a strong 
focus on 1.5°C versus 2°C (Karmalkar and Bradley, 2017; Dosio and Fischer, 2018; Karnauskas et al., 2018; 
Liu et al., 2018; Taylor et al., 2018; Weber et al., 2018; Chapter 3, SR1.5, IPCC 2018). Comparisons 
between pattern scaling and time-shift approaches allow assessment of the scalability of the regional climate 
change signal and the extent to which pattern scaling assumptions still hold at regional scale for a wide range 
of GWL. This was the approach followed by Matte et al. (2019) in their assessment of the scalability of 
European regional climate projections. Based on EURO-CORDEX projections, they performed a detailed 
comparison between the pattern scaling and the GWL spatial patterns (GWL range: 1°C, 2°C and 3°C) for 
different seasons, regional model resolutions, and both temperature and precipitation. High pattern 
correlation values (greater than 0.9) are found between the scaled pattern and all GWL patterns for 
temperature. In the case of precipitation, the correspondence is slightly lower, especially in summer, for high 
GWLs (2°C and 3°C) and much lower for 1°C. 
 
Figure 10.14 illustrates a similar comparison based on the CMIP6 multi-model ensemble forced with the 
scenario SSP5-8.5 and applied to two large-scale continental areas. The forced response to anthropogenic 
forcing is simply taken as the CMIP6 multi-model mean of future regional climate change relative to the 
1850–1900 reference period. Robustness of the forced response is based on both significance of the change 
and model agreement about the sign of change (Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1; Figure 10.14). Caution has to be 
exercised against a too literal interpretation of lack of robust change given that significance and sign 
agreement can be sensitive to spatial and temporal aggregation (Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1, Figure 2) and 
lack of a robust change does not necessarily translate to lack of regional-scale climate change impacts 
(McSweeney and Jones, 2013; Hibino and Takayabu, 2016). 
 
<figref>10.14</figref> 
  
If projected regional mean temperature (Figure 10.14a) and precipitation (Figure 10.14b) changes were to 
scale linearly with global mean warming, the adjusted spatial patterns would be congruent with each other at 
different GWLs. While pattern scaling seems to be a reasonable first-order approximation for both 
temperature and precipitation changes in tropical and high latitude regions (high pattern correlation values), 
there are a number of regions exhibiting substantial amplitude differences at different GWLs (Northern 
Africa and Middle East, southern and eastern Europe for temperature; southwestern North America, Chile 
and north-eastern Brazil for precipitation). These differences hint at the possible influence of nonlinear 
mechanisms (Good et al., 2015), including soil moisture feedbacks (Seneviratne et al., 2010; Vogel et al., 
2017), a time-dependent balance between the different contributions of fast and slow response to greenhouse 
gas forcing as well as changing SST response patterns (Long et al., 2014; Good et al., 2016; Ceppi et al., 
2018; Zappa et al., 2020). Decreasing spatial pattern amplitude with increasing GWL suggests that the initial 
transient regional response overshoots the long-term change in regions such as northern Africa for summer 
temperature and southwestern South America for precipitation (Zappa et al., 2020). In the latter region, long 
simulations with stabilized GHG concentrations even suggest a change of sign when near-equilibrium is 
reached (Sniderman et al., 2019). The reverse behaviour, increasing pattern amplitude with increasing GWL, 
is seen for summer temperature in southern and eastern Europe and for precipitation in southwestern North 
America (Sniderman et al., 2019; Zappa et al., 2020), suggesting that, in these regions, the initial transient 
response is lagging global mean warming and final regional climate change will be reached once GHG 
concentrations are stabilized.  
 
There is high confidence that the time-evolving contribution of different mechanisms operating at different 
time scales can modify the amplitude of the regional-scale response of temperature, and both the amplitude 
and sign of the regional-scale response of precipitation, to anthropogenic forcing. These mechanisms include 
non-linear temperature, precipitation and soil moisture feedbacks, and slow and fast response of SST patterns 
and atmospheric circulation changes to increasing GHGs. 
 
 
### 10.4.3.2  Emergence of the anthropogenic signal at regional scale 
 
This section provides an assessment of the different approaches used in emergence studies as well as 
sensitivities to methodological choices. The section then focuses on the possible influence of internal 
variability on future emergence of the simulated mean precipitation anthropogenic signal at regional scales 
with some illustrative examples. 
 
In climate science, emergence or distinguishability of a signal refers to the appearance of a persistent change 
in the probability distribution and/or temporal properties of a climate variable compared with that of a 
reference period (Giorgi and Bi, 2009; Mahlstein et al., 2011, 2012; Hawkins and Sutton, 2012; Section 
1.4.2). Similar to anthropogenic climate change detection (Cross-Working Group Box: Attribution (in 
Chapter 1)), signal emergence can be detected, at least initially, without identifying the physical causes of 
the emergence (Section 1.4.2). In the context of human influence on climate, the objective of emergence 
studies is the search for the appearance of a signal characterizing an anthropogenically-forced change 
relatively to the climate variability of a reference period, defined as the noise. 
 
Precise definitions of signal and noise as well as a metric to measure the relative importance of the signal are 
key ingredients of the emergence framework and depend on the framing question. In particular, emergence 
study results can depend on the specific definitions of signal and noise such as the level of spatial and 
temporal aggregation (McSweeney and Jones, 2013). For instance, grid-point scale emergence will likely be 
delayed compared with region-average emergence (Fischer et al., 2013; Maraun, 2013; Lehner et al., 2017a; 
Section 11.2.4; Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1, Figure 2). The signal is often estimated by a running mean multi-
decadal average or probability distribution function of the physical variable under scrutiny in order to avoid 
false emergence due to manifestation of multi-decadal internal variability (King et al., 2015). In the case of 
extremes such as climate records, a notion of multi-year persistence or recurrence can also be used to fully 
characterize the anthropogenic signal and its emergence (Christiansen, 2013; Bador et al., 2016). 
  
Emergence is also sensitive to the noise characteristics: assuming a common signal definition, larger signal-
to-noise values and earlier emergence will arise if the noise is based on decadal mean variability rather than 
interannual variability (Kusunoki et al., 2020). Depending on the framing question, the noise can include or 
omit external natural forcing such as volcanic and solar forcing (Zhang and Delworth, 2018; Silvy et al., 
2020). Furthermore, emergence results are very sensitive to the choice and length of the reference period 
(Section 1.4.1). The reference period can be the pre-industrial, the very recent past or even a time-evolving 
baseline, depending on both the framing and assumption that adaptation to the current climate has already 
occurred (King et al., 2015; Zhang and Delworth, 2018; Brouillet and Joussaume, 2020). These choices will 
then determine the type of simulations and periods that will be used to construct the noise distribution. 
Finally, the permanence of future emergence cannot be taken for granted when emergence occurs in the late-
21st century based on simulations ending in 2100 (Hawkins et al., 2014; King et al., 2015; Lehner et al., 
2017a). 
 
Robust assessments and comparisons of past emergence between observations and models are strengthened 
by the use of consistent definitions of signal and noise (Lehner et al., 2017a; Hawkins et al., 2020). In the 
case of future emergence under increasing greenhouse gas emissions, two main approaches have been 
followed to assess emergence. The first is based on estimating the signal and noise (and sometimes the 
signal-to-noise ratio as well) in individual models before using the resulting distribution median or mean to 
construct the final emergence metric (Hawkins and Sutton, 2012; Maraun, 2013b; Sui et al., 2014; Barrow 
and Sauchyn, 2019). The second method first estimates the signal as a multi-model mean change and the 
noise variance as a combination of internal variability and model structural differences (Giorgi and Bi, 2009; 
Mariotti et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2018). The first approach allows the definition of emergence of the 
signal relative to internal variability only and treats model error as source of uncertainty (Maraun, 2013b; 
Lehner et al., 2017a). The second assumes that the multi-model mean is the optimal estimate of the signal 
and confounds internal variability and model structural differences in the noise estimate. It is noteworthy that 
most emergence studies implicitly assume model independence (Annan and Hargreaves, 2017; Boé, 2018; 
Box 4.1) and therefore sensitivity of emergence results to model selection or weighting is rarely performed 
(Akhter et al., 2018). 
 
Metrics can vary from a simple signal-to-noise ratio to statistical distributional tests (King et al., 2015; 
Gaetani et al., 2020) and give median estimates and uncertainty bounds for the date (or time of emergence) 
corresponding to the exceedance of specific thresholds by the emergence metric. Reconciling future 
emergence results among different studies is challenging due to their many methodological differences 
including the choice of the reference period, the selected climate models and scenario, the precise definition 
of signal and noise and the choice of different signal-to-noise thresholds to characterize robust emergence. 
Contrasting with binary yes/no statements, emergence can also be viewed as a continuous process 
characterized by an amplitude or level, for example the value of the signal-to-noise ratio, that is a function of 
time or global warming level. 
  
Since AR5, the development and production of SMILEs (Sections 4.2.5 and 10.3.4.3) has allowed the 
assessment of the influence of internal variability on anthropogenic signal emergence. The influence of 
internal variability, and specifically of the unforced atmospheric circulation, on temperature signal 
emergence can delay or advance the time of emergence by a decade or two in mid-to-high latitude regions 
(Lehner et al., 2017a; Koenigk et al., 2020). Internal variability can also result in small or decreasing decadal 
to multi-decadal heatwave frequency trends under the historical anthropogenic forcing over most regions, 
thereby delaying emergence of unprecedented heatwave frequency trends relative to the pre-industrial trend 
distribution (Perkins-Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Sections 11.2–3). 
 
Regional precipitation future changes are much more impacted by internal variability than their temperature 
counterpart (Monerie et al., 2017b; Singh and AchutaRao, 2018; Dai and Bloecker, 2019; von Trentini et al., 
2019; Koenigk et al., 2020). Relative to mean temperature changes, this larger influence of internal 
variability on mean precipitation changes contributes, among other factors (Sarojini et al., 2016), to a much 
delayed emergence of the forced precipitation response in observations (Hawkins et al., 2020). Based on the 
CMIP6 multi-model ensemble forced with the scenario SSP5-8.5, we assess the future emergence of mean 
precipitation forced change as a function of GWLs for all AR6 land regions (Figure 10.15a). The 
methodology is a straightforward adaptation of the standard approach (Hawkins and Sutton, 2012). While the 
standard method is only based on the signal-to-noise ratio exceedance of a specified threshold (taken as one), 
the approach used here assumes that grid-point emergence occurs when the forced change is considered 
robust following the AR6 WGI1 definition of robustness for projected changes (Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1). 
At a GWL of 1°C, emergence only occurs in high-latitude regions (Wan et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2019b), 
albeit with only small (less than 30%) area fraction with robust change. Robust changes in tropical and 
subtropical regions only appear from GWLs of 1.5°C, for example in southwest South America (Boisier et 
al., 2016), western Africa (Hawkins et al., 2020; Section 10.4.2.1) and southern Australia (Delworth and 
Zeng, 2014). Substantial (taken here simply as area fraction greater than 50%) emergence only occurs in 
some tropical, subtropical and midlatitude regions when high GWLs (3°C–4°C) are reached. Importantly, 
even at these high GWL values, there are still a large number of these regions with robust changes covering 
less than 50% of their area. In contrast, most high-latitude regions have an area fraction with robust changes 
greater than 80% at GWLs of 3°C and above. 
 
<figref>10.15</figref> 
 
We now illustrate the potential influence of internal variability on late or lack of emergence for a few AR6 
land regions (Figure 10.15b). For each of these AR6 regions, the time evolution of the percentage area with 
robust annual mean precipitation change is estimated for both the CMIP6 multi-model ensemble and the 
three coupled SMILEs used throughout Chapter 10. Similarity in percentage area time evolution between 
CMIP6 and the three coupled SMILEs suggests that internal variability can substantially influence the timing 
of emergence. For example, internal variability could explain the mid-21st century emergence (percentage 
area greater than 50%) of the drying and wetting signal over the Mediterranean and South Asia (see also 
Section 10.6.3) regions, respectively. Internal variability can also contribute to the late and moderate 
emergence over southeast South America (see also Section 10.4.2) and western South Africa (see also 
Section 10.6.2). In contrast, it cannot explain the lack of robust changes (percentage area less than 30%) over 
western Africa at the end of the 21st century, suggesting that model differences are also contributing to the 
lack of emergence (Monerie et al., 2017b, 2017a). In addition to different forced signals, the differences of 
time evolution between the three SMILEs, in particular for African regions, point to the issue of global 
model performance in accurately representing internal variability and its future changes. While 
overestimation and underestimation of internal variability in current models have been reported (Eade et al., 
2014; Laepple and Huybers, 2014), methodological challenges to assess the magnitude and spatial pattern of 
model biases in simulating internal variability, still remain (Section 10.3.4.3). Therefore, the existence of 
model biases and the limited knowledge of their characteristics lead to limitations about a precise 
quantification of internal variability influence on delayed regional-scale emergence. 
 
There is high confidence that consistency in definitions of signal and noise, choice of the reference period 
and signal-to-noise threshold, is important to robustly assess the future emergence of anthropogenic signals 
across different types or generations of models, as well as comparing past emergence results between 
observations and models. There is high confidence that internal variability can delay the emergence of the 
regional-scale mean precipitation anthropogenic signal in many regions, mainly located in the tropics, 
subtropics and midlatitudes. An accurate estimation of the delay in regional-scale emergence caused by 
internal variability remains challenging due to global model biases in their representation of internal 
variability as well as methodological difficulties to precisely estimate these biases (high confidence). 
 
# 10.5  Combining Approaches to Constructing Regional Climate Information 
 
This section assesses approaches and challenges for producing climate information for climate risk 
assessments as well as for adaptation and policy decisions at regional scales (Section 10.1.2.1). An overview 
of the different sources used for developing regional climate information is given in Section 10.5.1. The role 
of the user context in the construction of climate information is assessed in Section 10.5.2. The distillation to 
combine multiple lines of evidence is assessed in Section 10.5.3. Finally, climate services in the context of 
regional climate information are assessed in Section 10.5.4. The role of storylines in constructing climate 
information is assessed in Box 10.2. The assessment of how regional climate information is distilled in the 
report is treated in Cross-Chapter Box 10.3, whereas the assessment of information on regional, physical 
climate processes that impact society or ecosystems, termed climatic impact-drivers (Section 10.1), appears 
in Chapter 12, as well as more information on climate services in Cross-Chapter Box 12.2. 
 
The rise in demand for relevant regional climate information (Hewitt et al., 2012, 2020; Lourenço et al., 
2016) has resulted in diverse approaches to produce it. Historically, the construction of climate information 
has been embedded in a linear supply chain: extracting the source data, processing into maps or derived data 
products, preparing the material for communication, and delivering to users (Section 10.1.4). Typical 
products are open-access, web-portal delivery services of data (Hewitson et al., 2017), which may also be 
implemented as commercialised climate services (Webber and Donner, 2017). Such a chain, although it is 
intended to meet a demand for regional climate information, contains many assumptions that are not obvious 
to the recipients and that may introduce possible misunderstandings in the hand-over from one community to 
the next (Meinke et al., 2006; Lemos et al., 2012). In recognition that data is not necessarily relevant 
information, a new pathway towards a tailored distillation of climate information has emerged. The 
construction of information assessed in this section draws on multiple sources (Figure 10.16), whereby the 
context framing for an application is addressed through co-design with users. The constructed information is 
then translated into the context of the user taking into account the values of all actors involved (Figure 10.1 
and Sections 10.5.2 and 10.5.3). 
 
 
## 10.5.1  Sources of Regional Climate Information 
 
<figref>10.16</figref> 
 
Regional climate information may be constructed from a diverse range of sources, each depending on 
different assumptions and affected by different methodological limitations (Sections 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4). 
The construction of information may lead to products for direct adoption by users, or intermediate products 
for further analysis by users and climate services agencies in collaboration with climate scientists. Widely 
used sources include: 

- Extrapolation of observed historical trends into the future (e.g., Livezey et al., 2007; Laaha et al., 
2016). Given that internal variability can affect regional trends significantly on decadal to 
multidecadal time scales (Section 10.4), this approach could be potentially misleading without other 
supporting evidence (Westra et al., 2010), or finding congruence with other changes (e.g., Langodan 
et al., 2020). 

- The output from global climate models (GCMs, Section 10.3.1), including high-resolution GCMs, 
for which performance has been assessed and documented (Section 10.3.3). Model data can be used 
in its raw form or may be bias adjusted (Section 10.3.1 and Cross-Chapter Box 10.2) or weighted 
(Section 10.3.4 and Box 4.1). 

- The output from dynamically (10.3.1.2) or statistically (10.3.1.3) downscaled GCM simulations for 
which performance has been assessed and documented as trustworthy (Section 10.3.3). Model data 
can be used in its raw form or may be bias adjusted, in the case of regional climate models (RCMs, 
Section 10.3.1). 

- Process understanding about climate and the drivers of regional climate variability and change, 
grounded in theory about dynamics, thermodynamics and other physics of the climate system as a 
basis for process-based evaluation. For instance, teleconnections are useful to understand the links 
between large and regional scales at both near and long-term depending on the application. (Sections 
10.1.3, 10.3.3, 10.4.1, 10.4.3 and Annex IV). 

- Idealized scenarios of possible future climates as narratives to explore the implications and 
consequences of such scenarios in the presence of uncertainty (Jack et al., 2021). This approach has 
been used to explore the response to geoengineering (Cao et al., 2016), as well as alternative 
scenarios where model projections are highly uncertain (Brown et al., 2016; Jack et al., 2021). 
Information directly from research reported in the peer-reviewed scientific literature (e.g, Sanderson 
et al., 2017) or related research reports such as communications to the UN Framework on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC) about national adaptation. 

- Engaging with climate scientists and local communities who may provide indigenous information 
(Makondo and Thomas, 2018; Rosenzweig and Neofotis, 2013). 

- Relevant information may also be drawn from paleoclimate studies (e.g., McGregor, 2018; 
Armstrong et al., 2020; Kiem et al., 2020) to support and contextualize other sources about more 
recent and projected changes. 


Different sources of information may be more appropriate for some purposes than others, as they may 
provide information better aligned to the spatial and temporal scales of interest, in different formats, and 
tailored to different types of application. In some cases, a purpose may be best served using several types of 
information together. For example, when model data is the primary source, it can be advantageous to employ 
data from multiple models or even from a range of different experiment types (Section 10.3.2) supported by 
assessing how the models reflect changes in driving processes. In this manner a purpose may be best served 
by seeking the congruence of several types of information together, though one needs to recognize how well 
the attributes of each source align with the specific need for information. Depending on resources, one may 
even design model experiments specifically for a given use, such as constructing physical climate storylines 
of individual events (Box 10.2 and Section 10.3.2). Such analyses may be complemented by event attribution 
studies (Section 11.1.4). 
 
Users of climate information may face the so-called practitioner’s dilemma: a plethora of different and 
potentially contrasting sources (Figure 10.16) may be available without a comprehensive and user-relevant 
evaluation, and these datasets may also lack a transparent and easily understandable explanation of 
underlying assumptions, strengths and limitations (Barsugli et al., 2013; Hewitson et al., 2017). Often, the 
choice of information source is therefore not determined by what is most relevant and informative for the 
question at hand, but rather by practical constraints such as accessibility and ease of use and may be limited 
to the availability of just one source in extreme cases (Rössler et al., 2019a). 
 
 
## 10.5.2  Framing Elements for Constructing User-Relevant Information 
 
### 10.5.2.1  Consideration of different contexts 
 
Without considering the specific context, the distillation of climate information relevant to users may poorly 
serve the goal of informing adaptation and policy (Cash et al., 2003; Lemos et al., 2012; Baztan et al., 2017). 
Section 10.1.4 identifies three implicit framing issues of constructing and delivering user-relevant climate 
information: practical issues arising from the climate information sources, issues with including the context 
in constructing the information, and difficulties presented by complex networks of practitioners. The social 
context strongly influences decisions about constructing information and requires a nuanced and holistic 
approach to recognize the complexity of a coupled social and physical system (Daron et al., 2014). For 
example, urban water managers must recognize the dependency of the city on different water resources and 
the interplay of both local and national government legislation that can involve a range of different 
constituencies and decision makers (Scott et al., 2018; Savelli et al., 2021). 
 
Context plays a role in determining the risks that may affect human systems and ecosystems and 
consequently the climate information needs. The context may also limit access to such information. Hence, 
the context imposes inherent constraints on how climate information can be constructed and optimally 
aligned with its intended application. Although contexts are unlimited in variety, some key contextual 
elements include: 

- Whether the problem formulation needs to be constructed through consultative activities that, for 
instance, help identify thresholds of vulnerability in complex urban or rural systems (Baztan et al., 
2017; Willyard et al., 2018) or is more a matter of addressing a generic vulnerability already 
identified, such as the frequency of flood events or recurrence intervals of multi-year droughts 
(Hallegatte et al., 2013). 

- Societal capacity, such as cultural or institutional flexibility and willingness to respond to different 
scientific information (e.g., Hart and Nisbet, 2012; Kahan, 2012, 2013). 

- The technical capability and expertise of the different actors, including users, producers, and 
communicators (e.g., Sarewitz, 2004; Gorddard et al., 2016). 

- Potential contrasts in value systems such as the different views of the Global North compared to 
those of economies in transition or under development (Henrich et al., 2010a, 2010b; Sapiains et al., 
2020). 

- The relative importance of climate change in relation to non-climate stressors on the temporal and 
spatial scales of interest to the user, which at times are not the ones initially assumed by the 
producers (Otto et al., 2015). 

- Availability, timing and accessibility of the required climate information, including the availability 
of sources such as observations, model simulations, literature and experts of the relevant regional 
climate (Mulwa et al., 2017). In developing countries, the availability of all or some of these sources 
may be limited (Dinku et al., 2014). 

These and other contextual elements can frame subsequent decisions about the construction of regional 
climate information for applications. For example, an engineer typically seeks quantitative information, 
while the policy community may be more responsive to storylines and how information is positioned within 
a causal network describing regional climate risk (Section 1.4.4 and Box 10.2). Multiple contexts can coexist 
and potentially result in competing approaches (for example, when urban governance contends with regional 
water-resource management in the same area). 
 
 
### 10.5.2.2  Developing climate information conditioned by values of different actors and communities 
 
Developing climate information relevant to user needs can be influenced by the explicit and implicit values 
of all parties: those constructing the information, those communicating the information, those receiving the 
information, and, critically, those who construct the problem statement being addressed. A discussion of how 
values in the scientific community shape climate research appears in Section 1.2.3.2. The influence of values 
need not be a source of bias or distortion; it is sometimes appropriate and beneficial: critical scrutiny from a 
diverse range of value-governing perspectives may uncover and challenge biases and omissions in the 
information that might otherwise go unrecognized (Longino, 2004). Dialogue among all parties in a 
culturally, socially, and economically heterogeneous society is therefore important for recognizing and 
reconciling value differences to best yield information that is salient, relevant and avoids ambiguity, most 
notably when informing the complexity of risks and resilience for human systems and ecosystems in 
developing nations (e.g., Baztan et al., 2017). 
 
Thus, a challenge with constructing climate information for users, especially about impactful change, is that 
producing the information may need to involve people with a variety of backgrounds, who have different 
sets of experiences, capabilities, and values. The information thus would need to accommodate and be 
relevant to a range of different ways of viewing the problem (Sarewitz, 2004; Rosenzweig and Neofotis, 
2013; Gorddard et al., 2016). Failure to recognize the variety of people using the climate information can 
make it ineffective, even if the source data on which it is based is of the highest quality, and may create a 
danger of mal-adaptation. 
 
<figref>10.17</figref> 
 
A substantial body of evidence shows that the receptivity of individuals to climate information is strongly 
conditioned by motivated reasoning (Hart and Nisbet, 2012; Kahan, 2012, 2013), wherein a person’s 
reception of climate information is influenced by the values of the community with which the person 
identifies. Adherence to a community’s values forms part of an individual’s social identity (Hart and Nisbet, 
2012). Individuals thus frame their analysis and understanding of climate information in the context of 
cultural values espoused by their community (Hart and Nisbet, 2012; Kahan, 2012, 2013; Campbell and Kay, 
2014; Bessette et al., 2017; Tschakert et al., 2017; Vezér et al., 2018). Successful framing of climate 
information products thus seeks to identify common ground with users, taking account of their values and 
interests. 
 
Given the relevance of both context and values, the effectiveness of climate information can increase if 
developed in partnership with the target communities (Tschakert et al., 2016; Figure 10.17). Such an 
approach can inspire trust among all parties and at the same time promote a co-production process (Cash et 
al., 2003). Recipients of information have the greatest trust when the communicator is perceived as 
understanding their context and sharing their values and identity (Corner et al., 2014). As a consequence, 
developing mental models informed by user values can help with understanding complex climate models and 
their outcomes (Bessette et al., 2017). 
 
The importance of a co-production process does not preclude the climate-research community from taking 
steps to develop and convey relevant information on its own. Indeed, communicating expert consensus about 
contested scientific issues is beneficial (Goldberg et al., 2019). Climate services (Section 10.5.4), in 
particular, can become effective means for using sources from the climate community and crafting these to 
be consistent with the needs, interests and values of stakeholder communities. However, simply presenting 
more information without recognizing user values and the contextual elements listed in Section 10.5.2.1 may 
be ineffective (Kahan, 2013). An aversion to climate information discordant with one’s preexisting beliefs 
can actually become stronger for people who are more scientifically literate: they feel more confident sifting 
through all sources of information to find support for their positions (Kahan, 2012). A challenge is that if 
climate information is not framed carefully, recognizing context and user values, it may make the sceptical 
person less receptive to further information about climate change (Corner et al., 2012; Hart and Nisbet, 2012; 
Shalev, 2015). A further complication is that audiences may view climate change as a problem distant in 
time and space (Spence et al., 2012), too threatening to acknowledge (Brügger et al., 2015; McDonald et al., 
2015), or too economically challenging to accept (Bessette et al., 2017). Identifying positive outcomes that 
align with user values, instead of adaptation and mitigation efforts, appears to promote the interest in and the 
success of climate information (Bain et al., 2012). 
 
### 10.5.2.3  The roles of spatial and temporal resolution in relation to decision scale 
 
Climate processes occur on a range of spatial and temporal scales, from global to local, from centuries and 
longer to days or less (Section 10.1.2 and Figure 10.3). Similarly, decisions by stakeholders cover a range of 
spatial and temporal scales that can vary with the size of their region of interest and scope of activity. 
However, the link between decision scales and the spatial and temporal resolution of climate and related 
non-climatic, natural-system information is not straightforward, and failure to recognize mismatches 
between the two can undermine the effectiveness and relevance of the information (Cumming et al., 2006; 
Sayles, 2018). 
 
Nevertheless, the scale of regional climate information does not have to be the same as the decision scale. 
 
Physical-climate storylines (Box 10.2) valid at large scales can be used to develop understanding that is 
relevant to local decisions. For example, global climate change affecting Antarctic ice-mass loss is relevant 
to formulating Dutch responses to sea-level rise (Haasnoot et al., 2020). On the other hand, extreme 
precipitation processes can occur on scales of tens of kilometres and smaller and thus require high resolution 
climate information when projecting future changes (e.g., Xie et al., 2015). An important factor for 
developing effective climate information using the distillation process is aligning the vulnerabilities of the 
social and economic systems under consideration ranging from, for example, those important to a farmer to 
those important to a national agricultural ministry (Andreassen et al., 2018; O’Higgins et al., 2019). Thus, 
more sophisticated matching of spatial and temporal resolution of climate information with decision scales 
requires engagement across a hierarchy of governance structures at national, regional and local level (e.g., 
Lagabrielle et al., 2018). 
 
 
## 10.5.3  Distillation of Climate Information 
 
The preceding sections laid out the diversity of sources of climate information (Section 10.5.1) and 
important elements for its use in a decision context (Section 10.5.2). Here, it is assessed how context-
relevant climate information can be distilled from these sources of information. Although the term 
distillation lacks a clear definition in the literature, it has, in principle, two aspects: the construction of 
(potentially user-targeted) information that is defensible and evidence-based (Giorgi, 2020), and the 
translation of this information into a specific context, targeting a specific purpose and set of values. The 
former typically involves data from multiple sources, including expert knowledge, and comprehensively 
considers relevant uncertainties to give physically plausible climate information. The latter translates the 
information explicitly into the user context, such as by linking it to experience, by formulating a narrative, by 
highlighting the relevance for the user context, or by putting the climate information into the context of the 
relevant non-climatic stressors. 
 
Distilling climate information for a specific purpose benefits from a co-production process that includes non-
climate-scientists in the research design, analysis and the exploration and interpretation of the results to best 
place it in context of the intended application (Collins and Ison, 2009; Berkhout et al., 2013; Wildschut, 
2017; Bhave et al., 2018; Dessai et al., 2018). Consideration of the specific contexts of information 
requirements by the provider as well as including the user values in connecting the science with users is 
increasingly recognized as paramount to construct information relevant for decisions at the regional scale  
(Section 10.5.2; Kruk et al., 2017; Vizy and Cook, 2017; Djenontin and Meadow, 2018; Parker and Lusk, 
2019; Norström et al., 2020; Turnhout et al., 2020). As a response, regional climate change information is 
increasingly being developed through participatory and context-specific dialogues that bring together 
producers and users across disciplines and define climate impacts as one of the many stressors shaping user 
decisions (Brown and Wilby, 2012; Lemos et al., 2012). Although there are multiple practical issues 
involving communication (Rössler et al., 2019a), such as providing data in a format that users can interpret, 
being mindful of the contextual issues raised in Section 10.5.2 allows non-scientists to be involved in 
decisions about approaches and assumptions for the distillation and thus to take ownership of the resultant 
information and to make informed decisions based on the distilled information (Pettenger, 2016; Verrax, 
2017). Importantly, the application of trans-disciplinary engagement processes that emphasise the role of 
non-scientists in the learning and knowledge production process builds relationships and trust between 
information users and producers, which is arguably as important for the uptake of climate science into 
decision making as the nature of the climate information itself (Section 10.5.2). 
 
 
### 10.5.3.1  Information construction 
 
Data, either from observations or models, is in general not inherently information, but may contain relevant 
information if interpreted appropriately (Hewitson et al., 2017). The same applies to other sources of climate 
information. Relevance is controlled by the given user context (Section 10.5.2.1) and relates to the required 
temporal and spatial scales (Section 10.5.2.3), the characteristics of required variables (often referred to as 
indicators), and the meteorological and climatic phenomena driving these variables (Section 10.1.3). For 
example, if climate information for driving impact models is sought (e.g., McSweeney et al., 2015), the 
impact modelling analysis in the target region is the specific user context. 
 
Climate risk assessment considers all plausible outcomes (Weaver et al., 2017; Marchau et al., 2019; Sutton, 
2019). Thus, a key element of information construction is the exploration and reconciliation of different 
sources of information (Barsugli et al., 2013; Hewitson et al., 2014b; Maraun and Widmann, 2018b) and 
involves mainly two issues: first, assessing the fitness of different sources in the given context and thereby 
potentially omitting (or down-weighting) selected sources (Sections 10.3.3), and, second, integrating 
different sources into a broader picture within a context (Sections 10.3.4).  
A non-comprehensive selection of approaches that may contribute to the construction of information 
includes: 

- Overall assessment and inter-comparison of different sources of information, including hierarchies 
of models and identification of potentially conflicting results (Figure 10.16), where observational 
availability plays a critical role (Section 10.2.3). 

- Assessing the emergence of forced trends from internal variability (Section 10.4.3), and testing 
whether differences in simulations can be explained by internal variability, ideally using initial-
condition large ensembles (Sections 10.3.4.3 and 10.4.3). 

- Assessing the interdependence of chosen models to identify the amount of independent information 
(Section 10.3.4.4). 

- Process-based evaluation with focus on those processes that are relevant for the specific application 
(Sections 10.3.3.4‒10.3.3.10). 

- Weighting or sub-selecting ensembles based on a priori knowledge or the outcome of a process-
based evaluation, while sampling as much uncertainty as possible (Section 10.3.4.4). 

- Tracing back differences in projections to the representation of fundamental processes, e.g., by using 
physical climate storylines (Sections 10.3.4.2 and Box 10.2) or sensitivity simulations (Section 
10.3.2.3). 

- Producing physical-climate storylines (Box 10.2) to explore uncertainties not sampled by available 
model ensembles (Shepherd et al., 2018), for example in pseudo-global warming experiments 
(Section 10.3.2.2), or to simulate events that have never happened before but are nevertheless 
plausible (Lin and Emanuel, 2016). 

- Attributing observed changes to different external forcings and internal drivers (Section 10.4.1).

- Comparing observed trends with past simulated trends in order to constrain projections with, for 
instance, the Allen-Stott-Kettleborough method (Allen et al., 2000; Stott and Kettleborough, 2002; 
Stott et al., 2013) to explain drivers of past observed trends (Section 10.4.2) for understanding future 
trends. 

- Integrating present-day performance via emergent constraints to reduce projection uncertainty 
(Section 10.3.2). 

- Complementing the observational and model-based sources with expert judgement (e.g., integrating 
knowledge from theory or experience that is available from experts or the literature; Section 10.5.1). 

These approaches often can be used in combination to increase confidence in conclusions drawn (Hewitson 
et al., 2017).  
 
 
### 10.5.3.2  Translating climate information into the user context 
 
Awareness and understanding of the users’ decision-making context is a central and key aspect of 
developing tailored, context-appropriate information (Briley et al., 2015), as clearly evidenced by the climate 
services’ experiences (e.g., Vincent et al., 2018). Understanding the context, however, is not trivial and 
requires understanding of both the user and provider (Guido et al., 2020) if the information is to be robust, 
reliable and relevant (Giorgi, 2020). Translating the information into context requires consideration of 
terminology and expectations (Briley et al., 2015), issues of user interpretation (Daron et al., 2015), and 
hence necessitating engagement in co-production with all attendant challenges (Vincent et al., 2021). The 
actual provision of climate information may be conducted at different levels of sophistication, ranging from 
generic data provision via web portals (Hewitson et al., 2017), potentially including impact-relevant climate 
indicators, region-specific factsheets and stakeholder reports, social media (Pearce et al., 2019), to a close 
engagement with specific stakeholders in co-exploring the research (Steynor et al., 2016). 
 
Climate information products may often lack explanations of their potential use and misuse (Street, 2016; 
Lamb, 2017; Chimani et al., 2020). This is particularly important if the information is provided as a generic, 
publicly accessible product without a specific context (Hewitson et al., 2017). Context-specific collaboration, 
especially if organized in workshop, enables a close transdisciplinary co-exploration of the results as in the 
form of climate risk narratives (Jack et al., 2020, Box 10.2). Such approaches explicitly account for the user 
context, values and non-climatic stressors (Steynor and Pasquini, 2019). 
 
 
### 10.5.3.3  Transdisciplinary approaches to stakeholder interaction 
 
The transdisciplinary interaction with stakeholders has been categorised into top-down, bottom-up and 
interactive approaches (Berkhout et al., 2013). Traditional top-down approaches frame the research from the 
perspective of global climate change as a driver of regional climate risk. Bottom-up approaches, also referred 
to as scenario-neutral impact studies (Prudhomme et al., 2010; Brown et al., 2012a, 2012b; Culley et al., 
2016) begin with the user’s articulation of vulnerability in the context of climatic and non-climatic stressors, 
follow with the definition of key system thresholds of climatic variables, and only incorporate climate data to 
assess the likelihood of threshold exceedances. Bottom-up approaches are special cases of robust decision 
making (Lempert et al., 2006; Lempert and Collins, 2007; Walker et al., 2013; Weaver et al., 2013), which 
are designed to account for uncertainties not represented by climate models as well as non-climatic stressors. 
Interactive approaches combine aspects of top-down and bottom-up approaches. The choice of approach 
depends on the context. While bottom-up approaches might be optimal in a local context, where case-
specific risks are addressed, top-down approaches provide generic information that may serve a range of 
different purposes, e.g., at the national scale (Berkhout et al., 2013). All these approaches benefit from the 
integration of fully distilled climate information (Berkhout et al., 2013; Maraun and Widmann, 2018b). 
 
 
### 10.5.3.4  Barriers to the distillation of climate information  
 
As implied by Section 10.5.2, meeting the needs of users can be a substantial challenge for climate scientists 
if they misunderstand or have limited understanding of user needs and context (Porter and Dessai, 2017). 
Several barriers in user communities can trigger and sustain this challenge. This can include an institutional 
aversion to incorporating new tools into decision making (Callahan et al., 1999). Coincident with this factor, 
there may be limited staff capacity, lack of management support and lack of a mandate to plan for climate 
change (Lee and Whitely Binder, 2010). 
 
Following from those challenges, constructing and communicating regional climate information often occurs 
under the overarching assumption that uncertainty is a problem and reducing uncertainty is the priority 
(Eisenack et al., 2014; Otto et al., 2016b). This is both a psychological (Morton et al., 2011) as well as a 
pragmatic barrier in cases where uncertainty appears to limit the ability to make decisions (Mukheibir and 
Ziervogel, 2007). However, where in-depth engagements with decision contexts are undertaken, these initial 
barriers are often dismantled to reveal a more complex, nuanced and potentially more productive intersection 
with climate information producers that can efficiently handle uncertainty (e.g., Rice et al., 2009; Lemos et 
al., 2012; Moss, 2016). Specifically, disclosure of all uncertainties in the climate information, transparency 
about the sources of these uncertainties, and tailoring the uncertainty information to specific decision 
frameworks have the potential for reducing problems of distilling and communicating uncertain climate 
information (Otto et al., 2016b). 
 
 
### 10.5.3.5  Synthesis assessment of climate information distillation  
 
There is high confidence that distilling climate information for a specific purpose benefits from a co-
production process that involves users of the information, considers the specific user context and the values 
of relevant actors such as users and scientists, and translates the resultant information into the broader user 
context. This process allows users to take ownership of the information, builds relationships and trust 
between information users and producers and helps to overcome barriers in the information construction. 
This process enhances trust in the information as well its usefulness, relevance, and uptake, especially when 
the communication involves complex, contextual details (high confidence). The optimal approach for the 
transdisciplinary collaboration with users depends on the specific context conditioned by the sources 
available and the actors involved, which together are dependent on the regions considered and the framing 
by the question being addressed. 
 
Drawing upon multiple lines of evidence in the construction of climate information increases the fitness of 
this information and creates a stronger foundation (high confidence). The lines of evidence can include 
multiple observational datasets, ensembles of different model types, process understanding, expert 
judgement, and indigenous knowledge, among others. Attribution studies, the characterization of possible 
outcomes associated with internal variability and a comprehensive assessment of observational, model and 
forcing uncertainties and possible contradictions using different analysis methods are important elements of 
distillation. To make the most appropriate decisions and responses to changing climate it is necessary to 
consider all physically plausible outcomes from multiple lines of evidence, especially in the case when they 
are contrasting such as in the examples of Cross-Chapter Box 10.1 and Section 10.6.2. 
 
 
## 10.5.4  Climate Services and the Construction of Regional Climate Information 
 
Climate services have been defined as the provision of climate information to assist decision-making 
(Sections 1.2.3, and 12.6, and Cross-Chapter Box 12.2). Services are expected to be based on scientifically 
credible information and expertise, have appropriate engagement from users and providers, have an effective 
access mechanism and aim at meeting the users’ needs (Hewitt et al., 2020). To achieve this, climate services 
synthesize context-relevant climate information addressing questions for a wide range of climate time scales. 
From this point of view, climate services are instruments for the production, translation and transfer of 
climate information and knowledge for their use in climate-informed decision-making and climate-smart 
policy and planning (Hewitt et al., 2012). The appropriate provision of climate services considers the 
diagnosis of climate information needs, the service itself and a number of good practices still under 
development (Vaughan et al., 2018). 
 
The preceding subsections assess research on the distillation of climate information, which is directly 
relevant for the development of climate services. Distillation, when implemented appropriately and 
interpreted with all due caveats, leads to credible climate information with a broader foundation of evidence 
to be used in climate services practice according to the recommendations of the Global Framework for 
Climate Services (Hewitt et al., 2012). As stated in Chapter 12, climate services set new scientific challenges 
to research. Examples of some of the challenges have been given in Chapters 1 and 12, which are 
complemented by the barriers to the distillation assessed in Section 10.5.3.3.

# 10.6  Comprehensive Examples of Steps Toward Constructing Regional Climate Information 
 
## 10.6.1  Introduction 
 
This section presents three comprehensive examples of steps for distilling regional climate information from 
the multiple sources of regional climate information presented in this chapter. These examples build on the 
general framework presented in Section 10.5, examining in particular the strengths and challenges in linking 
the different sources, while also exposing the assumptions behind and consequences of decisions made in the 
process. The examples are framed taking into account societal perspectives that provide context for their 
regional climate statements. Although the nature of an IPCC Working Group I assessment precludes 
engaging with users of climate information (Section 10.5), we do cite relevant national and regional reports 
that give user perspectives to set a foundation from which one could distil climate information for users. We 
have chosen the recent Cape Town drought, Indian summer-monsoon trends and the Mediterranean summer 
warming because they provide a geographically diverse set of locations and relevant processes and because 
most of the components for constructing regional climate information outlined in Chapter 10 are directly 
relevant to each case. 
 
The three comprehensive examples follow a similar structure: 

- Motivation and regional context 
- The region’s climate  
- Observational issues 
- Relevant anthropogenic and natural drivers 
- Model simulation and attribution over the historical period  
- Future climate information from global simulations 
- Future climate information from regional downscaling 
- Storylines 
- Climate information distilled from multiple lines of evidence 

 
Following this structure, construction of the regional climate information presented in these examples 
depends on an assessment of observational uncertainty relative to the magnitude of a climate-change signal 
(Section 10.2), the evaluations of model performance to judge the fitness for purpose of a given model 
(Section 10.3), and expert judgement. These factors contribute to attribution of historical climate-change 
signals (Section 10.4), recognizing that attribution must account for the interplay between externally forced 
signals and unforced internal variability. This interplay is explored using multiple model ensembles, 
including, when appropriate and feasible, single-model initial-condition large ensembles (SMILEs). The 
multiple lines of evidence for the climate information may conflict, thus requiring distillation of the evidence 
(Section 10.5) to arrive at climate-change statements. When moving from global climate information to 
climate information at the regional scale, following the structure above provides a basis for arriving at 
relevant and credible climate information. The comprehensive examples of distilling climate information 
thus show the value of working with multiple lines of evidence to develop robust climate change information 
for a region. 
 
In addition to the three comprehensive examples, this section contains two additional examples analysing 
multiple sources of regional climate information. Box 10.3 on urban climate assesses information that 
provides a foundation for understanding climatic behaviour in urban areas and its projected change. Cross-
Chapter Box 10.4 on climate change over the Hindu Kush Himalaya assembles information rooted in several 
chapters and previous assessment reports to assess understanding of several climate elements (temperature, 
precipitation, snow and glaciers, and extreme events) for the region and their projected changes. 
 
As these examples will show, the distillation process of regional climate information from multiple lines of 
evidence can vary substantially from one case to another. Confidence in the distilled regional climate 
information is enhanced when there is agreement across multiple lines of evidence, but the outcome of 
distilling regional climate information can be limited by inconsistent or contradictory sources. 
 
 
## 10.6.2  Cape Town Drought 
 
### 10.6.2.1  Motivation and regional context 
 
Cape Town’s “Day Zero” water crisis in 2018 threatened a shut-down of water supply to 3.4 million 
inhabitants of the city and resulted in domestic water use restriction of 50 litres per person per day (pre-
drought unconstrained water use was ~170 litres per person per day, DWA, 2013) lasting for nine months, 
punitive water tariffs, and temporary closure of irrigation systems. Problems with water supply in many large 
cities in developing countries are endemic and rarely reported internationally. The water crisis in Cape Town 
attracted considerable international attention to a city with functional government structures, well developed 
services (compared to other urban centres in Africa), a centre of international tourism, and an economic hub 
with GDP of USD22 billion (~USD 7,500 per capita, Gallie et al., 2018). Economic and social impacts of the 
crisis were significant. Loss of revenue for companies of all sizes resulted not only from the scaling down of 
water-dependent activities, but also from the need to invest in water-efficient technologies and processes. 

Tourism was affected through reduced arrivals and bookings, although only temporarily (CTT, 2018). In the 
agricultural sector, 30,000 people were laid-off and production dropped by 20% (Piennaar and Boonzaaier, 
2018). The crisis initially polarized society, with conflict emerging between various water users and erosion 
of trust in the government, but eventually social cohesion and an acute awareness of limited water resources 
emerged (Robins, 2019). 
 
Cape Town’s crisis resulted from a combination of a strong, rare multi-year meteorological drought (Figure 
10.18), estimated at 1 in 300 years (Wolski, 2018), and factors related to the nature of the water supply 
system, operational water management and water resource policies. Cape Town was very successful in 
implementing water-saving actions after the previous drought of 2000–2003, reducing water losses from 
over 22% to 15% (Frame and Killick, 2007; DWA, 2013), breaking the previous coupling of growth in water 
demand with growth in population. As a consequence, Cape Town won a Water Smart City award from the 
C40 Cities program only three years prior to the crisis. However, the water-saving actions, together with 
changing priorities in water resource provision from infrastructure-oriented towards resource and demand 
management, may well have led to delays in implementation of the expansion of water supply infrastructure 
(Muller, 2018). The expansion plan, formulated a decade prior to the crisis, included an expectation of long-
term climate-change drying in the region (DWAF, 2007). The crisis also exposed structural deficiencies of 
water management and inadequacy of a policy process in which decisions about local water resources are 
taken at a national level, particularly in a situation of political tension (Visser, 2018). The crisis was widely 
seen as a harbinger of future problems to be faced by the city, and a highlight of vulnerability of many cities 
in the world resulting from the interplay of three factors: 1) the fast urban-population growth, 2) the 
economic, policy, infrastructural and water resource paradigms and constraints, and 3) anthropogenic climate 
change.

### 10.6.2.2  The region’s climate 
 
An evaluation of the relative role of rainfall and temperature signal in the 2015–2017 hydrological drought 
gives a strong indication that lack of rainfall was the primary driver (Otto et al., 2018) leading to the 2018 
water crisis. Thus, the remainder of this section focuses on rainfall. Section 11.6 offers a discussion of 
African drought over broader areas, including mechanisms relevant to them. 
 
Cape Town is located at the southwestern tip of Africa, within an approximately 100 km x 300 km region 
that receives 80% of its rainfall during the austral winter (March to October), with the largest portion in June 
to August. In the vicinity of Cape Town, rainfall is strongly heterogeneous, ranging from ~300 mm/year on 
coastal plains to >2,000 mm/year in mountain ranges. The Cape Town water supply relies on surface water 
reservoirs located in a few small mountain catchments (~800 km2 in total). The Cape Town region receives 
85% of its rainfall from a series of cold fronts forming within mid-latitude cyclones. The remainder is 
brought in by infrequent cut-off lows that occur throughout the year (Favre et al., 2013). This creates a very 
strong water resource dependency on a single rainfall delivery mechanism that may be strongly affected by 
anthropogenic climate change (Chapter 4, Section 10.6.2.6). 
 
The 2015–2017 drought had strong low-rainfall anomalies in shoulder seasons (March to May and 
September to November, though weaker in the latter), and average rainfall in June and July (Sousa et al., 
2018a; Mahlalela et al., 2019). The anomaly resulted from fewer rainfall events and lower average intensity 
of events. The anomaly was strongest in the mountainous region where the water supply system’s catchments 
are located (Wolski et al., 2021). 
 
Although the 2015–2017 drought was unprecedented in the historical record, the Cape Town region has 
experienced other droughts of substantial magnitude, notably in the 1930s, 1970s and more recently in 2000‒2003.
Long term (>90 years) rainfall trends are mixed in sign, location-dependent, and weak (Kruger and 
Nxumalo, 2017; Wolski et al., 2021); mid-term (~50 years) trends are similarly mixed in sign (MacKellar et 
al., 2014). In the southwestern part of the region, rainfall is mostly decreasing in the post 1981 period, 
particularly in December-January-February and March-April-May, although there is no trend or a weak 
wetting in June-July-August (Sousa et al., 2018a; Wolski et al., 2021). Rainfall trends of similar magnitude 
and duration to the post-1981 trend accompanied previous strong droughts in the region (Wolski et al., 2021). 
 
### 10.6.2.3  Observational issues 
 
South Africa and the Cape Town region have good instrumental weather data. Records start in the late 
1800s, with in excess of 10 gauges reporting since the 1920s, expanding to ~80 gauges in the 1980s, but the 
number of stations has declined since. The mountains have only a few stations, which receive more than 
1,000 mm/year. In view of the strong heterogeneity of rainfall, changes in the number of stations 
contributing to datasets such as CRU and GPCP results in a lack of consistency between them, which limits 
their reliability in the region (Wolski et al., 2021; Section 10.2). 
 
### 10.6.2.4  Relevant anthropogenic and natural drivers 
 
Because the primary rainfall mechanism is frontal rain, the most relevant large-scale drivers are those that 
affect cyclogenesis, frontogenesis and the mid-latitude westerlies’ latitudinal position and moisture supply. 
These drivers and, thus, the region’s rainfall are linked to the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO; Reason and 
Rouault, 2005) or Southern Annual Mode (SAM), the dominant monthly and interannual mode of Southern 
Hemisphere atmospheric variability, and a measure of the pressure gradient between mid- and high-latitudes.  
(see Sections 3.3, 3.7, 4.3 and Annex IV.2.2 for more general discussion of the SAM.) While in the post-
1930 period, the SAM displays a long-term positive trend, the Cape Town region’s rainfall does not, and 
only the post-1979 trends of rainfall and SAM are conceptually consistent, i.e., a positive trend in the SAM 
is associated with a negative trend in rainfall (Section 10.6.2.5 and Figure 10.18). There is also good 
agreement between the seasonality of the SAM and rainfall trends in the post-1979 period: a drying trend appears 
strongly in December to February and March to May, but not in June to August and September to November 
(Wolski et al., 2021), and trends in the SAM have similar seasonal dependence (Lim et al., 2016b; Section 3.7.2). 
 
Additionally, there is a similar seasonal pattern in the post-1979 trends in indices capturing the southern edge of the 
Hadley circulation (Grise et al., 2018). 
 
In the longer-term, Cape Town regional rainfall is characterized by a multi-decadal scale quasi-periodicity 
(Figure 10.18; Dieppois et al., 2019; Wolski et al., 2021), with the 2015‒2017 drought and previous strong 
droughts (1930s and 1970s) occurring during the rainfall’s periodic low phases. However, the studies linking 
the Cape Town 2015‒2017 drought to the hemispheric processes expressed by the SAM (Sousa et al., 2018a; Burls 
et al., 2019; Mahlalela et al., 2019) focused almost exclusively on the post-1979 period, when global reanalyses are 
available. Detailed understanding of the drivers of previous (1930s and 1970s) Cape Town region droughts 
and the role of hemispheric processes expressed by the SAM in the pre-1979 period is missing. 
 
The Cape Town regional rainfall is also potentially linked to other hemispheric phenomena, such as the 
expansion of the tropics and, specifically, the South Atlantic high-pressure system and the position of the 
subtropical jet, which share some variability with the SAM. The relationships between these phenomena and 
Cape Town rainfall have not been thoroughly investigated outside of the context of the 2015–2017 drought, 
but the drought itself was associated with poleward expansion of the subtropical anticyclones in the South 
Atlantic and South Indian Oceans and (a resulting) poleward displacement of the moisture corridor across the 
South Atlantic (Sousa et al., 2018a), as well as a weaker subtropical jet (Mahlalela et al., 2019). Burls et al. 
(2019) also link the decline in the number of rainy days to the increase in sea-level pressure along the 
poleward flank of the South Atlantic high-pressure system and the intensity of the post-frontal ridging high. 
Additionally, there is a possible linkage between Cape Town rainfall and near-shore cold sea surface 
temperature (SST) anomalies arising from Ekman upwelling due to reduced westerly and increased south-
easterly winds. These might lead to suppression of convection and reduction of rainfall over land (Rouault et al., 
2010). All these phenomena are conceptually consistent with the poleward migration of the westerlies and 
expansion of the tropics. 
 
Rainfall in the Cape Town region also responds to SST anomalies in the Southeast Atlantic, including the 
Agulhas Current retroflection region, which may drive intensification of low-pressure systems, leading to the 
trailing front strengthening as it makes landfall over the Cape Town region (Reason and Jagadheesha, 2005). 
There are also linkages at seasonal time scale between the Cape Town regional rainfall and Antarctic sea ice 
(Blamey and Reason, 2007). 
 
In addition to mid-latitude controls, subtropical processes also play a role in the Cape Town region’s rainfall 
variability. The 10˚‒30˚S region of the subtropical Atlantic, parts of the South American continent and even 
parts of the African continent north of Cape Town are sources of moisture for atmospheric river events 
contributing to frontal rainfall (Blamey et al., 2018; Ramos et al., 2019), with implications for the 2015‒
2017 drought (Sousa et al., 2018a). Also, the second major rainfall contributing system, cut-off-lows, is 
conditional on moisture supply from the sub-tropics (Abba Omar and Abiodun, 2020). 
 
Although El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences climate in southern Africa, any relationship 
between ENSO and Cape Town’s rainfall is weak and inconsistent, showing the strongest impact in May to 
June (Philippon et al., 2012). ENSO, however, does influence large-scale processes and phenomena relevant 
to the drought, though the relationship between ENSO and the SAM is complex, with each ENSO event 
influencing the SAM differently in different seasons (Ding et al., 2012). Similarly, ENSO affects meridional 
circulation and thus the subtropical anticyclone as well as the polar and subtropical jets (Seager et al., 2019), 
but only modifying, not controlling, their role in Cape Town’s rainfall. 
 
Paleoclimate studies reveal that long-term variability in the winter rainfall region of South Africa (including 
Cape Town) is consistent with a general framework of warming/cooling-induced latitudinal migration of the 
westerlies and transformation of the subtropical high-pressure belt and associated hemispherical processes 
(see section 10.2.3.2 for assessment of paleoclimate analysis). The synchronicity of winter rainfall with 
Antarctic ice-core-derived polar temperature anomalies is consistently revealed in studies using different 
paleoclimate proxies and time scales of 1.4k (Stager et al., 2012), ~3k (Hahn et al., 2016) and 12k years 
(Weldeab et al., 2013). Changes in rainfall regimes at shorter (decadal) time scales appear to reflect 
influence of local processes such as the Agulhas current's interaction with the Atlantic, resulting in changes 
in SST and coastal upwelling, as well as modification of the wind tracks by topography (Stager et al., 2012). 
 
 
### 10.6.2.5  Model simulation and attribution over the historical period 
 
Due to the small scale of the Cape Town region, robust comparison of CMIP simulations to observations is 
difficult. However, in general, CMIP5 models capture well the seasonality, such as the dominance of austral 
winter rains, although they overestimate the peak and underestimate the shoulder season rainfall (Mahlalela 
et al., 2019). Trends in rainfall are particularly difficult to assess as they are generally weak and depend 
strongly on the time period and dataset adopted for the analyses (Section 10.6.2.3). A multi-method 
attribution study (Otto et al., 2018) estimates the probability of the 2015‒2017 drought to have increased by 
a factor of 3 since pre-industrial times (with a wide 95% confidence interval of 1.5 to 6). However, 
throughout the 20th century, a substantial portion of the global climate models (GCMs; ~36% of CMIP5 and 
44% of CMIP6 models, as well as many of the MIROC SMILE members) simulate a statistically significant 
(95% level) decline in total annual rainfall, while there is no robust long-term trend in observations (Figure 
10.18).  Section 10.4 offers a more detailed assessment of attribution challenges. 
 
GCMs capture the overall behaviour of the observed main hemispherical processes, such as the expansion of 
the tropics, a positive trend in SAM and the poleward shift of the westerly jet. However, they fail to capture 
details of their observed climatology and variability (Simpson and Polvani, 2016), and the magnitudes of 
simulated trends vary, though the models typically underestimate observed trends in these processes (Purich 
et al., 2013; Staten et al., 2018). In general, CMIP5 models do capture the SAM-regional rainfall association, 
although not consistently across all seasons (Purich et al., 2013; Lim et al., 2016a). 
 
 
### 10.6.2.6  Future climate information from global simulations 
 
GCMs show strong consistency in a drying signal for the Cape Town region, with the reduction in total 
annual rainfall ranging up to 20% by the end of the 21st century in CMIP5 RCP8.5 and CMIP6 SSP5-8.5 
simulations (Almazroui et al., 2020a; Figure 10.18). The consistency across the models is a robust signal 
compared to the rest of southern Africa, where the climate change signal varies spatially: stronger drying in 
the west and moderate drying or weak wetting in the east (DEA, 2013, 2018; Atlas.4.4 for further discussion 
of southern Africa precipitation projections). Rainfall changes projected for the Cape Town region are 
consistent with projected changes in hemispheric-scale processes and regional-scale dynamics that point 
toward reduced frequency of frontal systems affecting that region. These changes include robust signals in 
CMIP5 models for the Southern Hemisphere for a poleward expansion of the tropics (Hu et al., 2013b), 
poleward displacement of mid-latitude storm tracks (Chang et al., 2012), increased strength and poleward 
shift of the westerly winds (Bracegirdle et al., 2018) and subtropical jet-streams (Chenoli et al., 2017), and a 
shift toward a more positive phase of the SAM (Lim et al., 2016a). However, despite the consistency in 
circulation changes, the emergence of anthropogenic rainfall change above unforced variability in 
southwestern Africa remains uncertain for annual rainfall throughout most of the 21st century, even under 
SSP5-8.5 (Section 10.4, Figure 10.15). 
 
There is also a substantial increase in the frequency of conditions supporting atmospheric rivers and water 
vapour transport towards the southwest coast of southern Africa in the projected climate (Espinoza et al., 
2018). This behaviour has strong implications for the region, as most topographically high locations receive 
rainfall from persistent atmospheric rivers (Blamey et al., 2018). A thorough understanding of the role of 
atmospheric rivers in the Cape Town region under a changing climate is missing. 
 
 
### 10.6.2.7  Future climate information from regional downscaling 
 
Dynamical downscaling studies implemented with a stretched-grid model (Engelbrecht et al., 2009) revealed 
a signal compatible with the driving CMIP5 ensemble, that is, consistent drying throughout the region, 
amplifying in time, irrespective of the considered emission scenario and the generation of GCMs (DEA, 
2013, 2018). A multi-model CORDEX ensemble indicates a robust signal of reduction of total annual 
rainfall in the future, although there is less agreement on how changes in rainfall occurrence may evolve in 
the region, such as through fewer consecutive rain days or longer dry spells (Abiodun et al., 2017; Maúre et 
al., 2018). For the end of the century under RCP8.5, Dosio et al. (2019) also found drying. Moreover, in their 
analysis, the drying is associated with an increase in the number of consecutive dry days and a reduction in 
number of rainy days. Their results are consistent with the driving GCMs for all the precipitation indices, 
and they are robust independent of the choice of the regional climate model (RCM) or GCM. However, 
collectively, these analyses indicate that uncertainty remains in the characteristics of the precipitation 
decrease. 
 
 
### 10.6.2.8  Storyline approaches 
 
There is a consistency in rainfall projections with the projections of rainfall drivers and with the general 
understanding of the influence of global warming on the circulation dynamics and rainfall patterns in the 
region. Thus, the expansion of the South Atlantic high-pressure system, related to widespread warming of 
the tropics and poleward shift of the subsiding limb of the Hadley cell, is associated with the southward 
displacement of the subtropical jet, and southward migration of mid-latitude westerlies and storm tracks, in 
addition to changes in the SAM (Section 10.6.2.4). These effects are also relatively consistent with recent 
(post-1980s) declines in rainfall in the Cape Town region. The storyline of an extended drought is thus a set 
of events that can yield reduced rainfall in the Cape Town region: poleward shift of the downward branch of 
the Hadley cell that produces a sustained southward shift in mid-latitude westerlies and storm tracks. The 
behaviour is potentially reinforced by changes in the SAM. 
 
 
### 10.6.2.9  Climate information distilled from multiple lines of evidence 
 
There is high agreement among observational data and reanalyses that the recent (post-1979) downward 
trend in the Cape Town region’s rainfall leading to the 2015‒2017 drought is related to the hemispheric 
processes of poleward shift in the westerlies and expansion of the Hadley circulation. However, there is less 
support for the precipitation-circulation relationship in historical CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulations. As a 
consequence, there is only medium confidence that these process changes produced the 2015‒2017 drought 
leading to the 2018 water crisis. 
 
For the water-resource planner who has to deal with potential drought like the 2015-2017 event, several lines 
of evidence indicate future drying: the projected precipitation by GCMs and RCMs of different spatial 
resolutions, and the observed and projected changes of circulation patterns consistent with drier conditions, 
the paleoclimatic evidence confirming a millennial-scale circulation-rainfall link. However, the distillation is 
limited by a lack of information about whether or not a relationship between Cape Town precipitation and 
large-scale circulation processes adequately explains droughts in the twentieth century prior to 1979. 
 
Thus, although a clear association appears in observations from 1979 onward between increasing GHG 
concentrations, drying in the Cape Town region and behaviour of a key circulation process, the SAM, further 
analysis suggests caution. Not all GCMs show the historical post-1979 association among these factors, and 
when the observational record is extended back further to times when the anthropogenic greenhouse forcing 
was weaker, there is no strong association between the SAM and Cape Town drought. Thus, there is only 
medium confidence in the expectation of a future drier climate for Cape Town. 
 
 
## 10.6.3  Indian Summer Monsoon 
 
### 10.6.3.1  Motivation and regional context 
 
The Indian summer monsoon provides 80% of the country’s annual rainfall from June to September, 
supplying the majority of water for agriculture, industry, drinking and sanitation to over a billion people. 

Any variations in the monsoon on time scales from days to decades can have large impacts (Challinor et al., 
2006; Gadgil and Gadgil, 2006). Evidence from paleoclimate records (Sections 8.3.2.4.1) shows high 
confidence in a weakened Indian monsoon during cold epochs of the past such as the Younger Dryas 
(12,800-11,600 years ago) as measured by speleothem oxygen isotopes (Kathayat et al., 2016). There is a 
pressing need to understand if the monsoon will change in the future under anthropogenic forcing and to 
quantify such changes. Multiple datasets have shown robust negative trends since the 1950s until the turn of 
the century (Bollasina et al., 2011) followed by a recovery (Jin and Wang, 2017), yet repeated assessments 
project the monsoon to increase in strength under enhanced GHG forcing (Christensen et al., 2007, 2013; 
Sections 8.3.2.4.1 and 8.4.2.4.1). The apparent contradiction between future projections and observed 
historical trends makes the region an ideal choice for an in-depth assessment. The reader is also referred to 
the South Asia (SAS) regional assessment of precipitation extremes (Section 11.9), which is not discussed 
here for brevity. 
 
 
### 10.6.3.2  The regional climate of India 
 
Local geography gives rise to distinct differences in societal experience of the summer monsoon. The 
southwesterly monsoon winds are incident upon the Western Ghats mountains on the west coast, leading to 
orographic enhancement and heavy rains (Shige et al., 2017), which supply rivers with water for much of the 
southern peninsula, often the subject of inter-regional water disputes. The northern plains contain the Ganges 
river and also India’s most intensive agriculture, both rainfed and irrigated. Synoptic systems known as 
monsoon depressions cross the northern east coast, supplying much of the rain in central India (Hunt and 
Fletcher, 2019). Further north, the eastern Himalayas are dominated by the summer monsoon, while the 
western Himalayas receive most rainfall from western disturbances during winter (Palazzi et al., 2013). 
Meanwhile, southeastern India sits under a rain shadow (the only region to receive more rainfall during the 
winter monsoon). 
 
 
### 10.6.3.3  Observational issues for India 
 
India has one of the oldest rain-gauge networks in the world, leading to the production of numerous 
observational products (reviewed in Khouider et al., 2020). Gridded gauge-based products dating back to the 
19th century reveal pronounced decadal variability (Sontakke et al., 2008). Trends for India over the whole 
20th century are inconclusive (Knutson and Zeng, 2018), although declining over central and northern areas 
(Roxy et al., 2015). Assessment of multiple observational datasets covering the Indian summer monsoon 
reveals significant declining rainfall over the second half of the 20th century (Section 8.3.2.4.1, Figure 
10.19c,d). A subsequent recovery has been noted since the early 2000s (Jin and Wang, 2017). 
 
Observational products containing critical inhomogeneities in gauge distribution and reporting over time are 
acknowledged as suitable for mesoscale analysis (Rajeevan and Bhate, 2009), while use for climate trends 
requires consistent reporting over time from quality-controlled gauges (e.g., ~2000 gauges since the 1950s in 
Rajeevan et al., 2006). A newer 0.25°-gridded product covering 1901 onwards (Pai et al., 2014, 2015), based 
on Shepard’s interpolation method for irregularly-spaced stations (Shepard, 1968), shows increased intensity 
of daily rainfall and extremes over some regions, especially in the late-20th century. However, changes to the 
inputted gauges may have introduced an artificial jump in extreme rainfall since 1975 over central India 
(Section 10.2.2.3; Lin and Huybers, 2019). They suggest that this method may have masked declines in 
mean rainfall and highlight the need for availability of raw gauge data to allow transparent assessments. 
Khouider et al. (2020) have successfully tested a probabilistic interpolation method for India to overcome 
problems inherent in algorithms based on inverse-distance weighting when applied to data-sparse regions. 
An example snapshot of the uneven distribution of rain gauges in a common observational product is shown 
in Figure 10.19a. 
 
The uncertainty among local and international observational products for India can pose challenges when 
evaluating climate models (as in Section 10.2.2.6; Prakash et al., 2015). For the seasonal mean summer 
monsoon rainfall, Collins et al. (2013) found large biases separating many CMIP5 models from the available 
observational products. However, for seasonal mean variability, the spread across observational products 
was larger than across the CMIP5 ensemble. 
 
 
### 10.6.3.4 Relevant anthropogenic and natural drivers for long-term change 
 
The relevant drivers for long-term change in the mean Indian summer monsoon are summarised briefly: 

- Increased greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations (chiefly CO2) are a strong contributor to changes in 
the monsoon, with repercussions for the meridional temperature contrast driving the monsoon 
circulation (Ueda et al., 2006; Roxy et al., 2015), for the monsoon winds in the lower troposphere 
(Cherchi et al., 2011; Krishnan et al., 2013), or for the availability of moisture from the Indian Ocean 
(May, 2011). 
- Industrial emissions of sulphate aerosol predominantly in the Northern Hemisphere could change 
inter-hemispheric energy transports and weaken the monsoon (Polson et al., 2014; Undorf et al., 
2018). The effect of local anthropogenic emissions of black carbon (chiefly from cooking fires) is 
uncertain (Lau and Kim, 2006; Nigam and Bollasina, 2010). 
- India’s green revolution over the late-20th century led to considerable land-use change, with massive 
expansion of agriculture at the expense of forest and shrublands. As a result, India’s northern plains 
feature widespread irrigation, suggested to be a cause of drying (Mathur and AchutaRao, 2020). 
- Decadal modes of variability such as the Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV, Annex IV) and Atlantic 
Multidecadal Variability (AMV, Annex IV), which may be partly forced (Section 3.7.7), are known 
to cause decadal modulation of the monsoon (Krishnamurthy and Krishnamurthy, 2014; Naidu et al., 
2020).  

The interplay of these external and internal drivers is key to understanding past and future monsoon change. 
 
 
### 10.6.3.5  Model simulation and attribution of drying over the historical period 
 
The robust decline of Indian summer monsoon rainfall averaged over India in the second half of the 20th 
century (Section 10.6.3.3) is not in line with expectations arising from thermodynamic constraints on the 
water cycle in a warming world (Section 8.2.2) and has been regarded as a puzzle (Goswami et al., 2006). 
Assessing the attribution of 20th-century changes to Indian rainfall is the subject of coordinated modelling 
under the Global Monsoon MIP (GMMIP; Zhou et al., 2016), but is complicated by long-standing dry biases 
in coupled CMIP3, CMIP5 (Sperber et al., 2013) and CMIP6 (Figure 10.19b) GCMs. These dry biases are 
connected to a lower tropospheric circulation that is too weak (Sperber et al., 2013) and wet biases in the 
equatorial Indian Ocean (Bollasina and Ming, 2013). Section 8.3.2.4.1 finds high confidence that 
anthropogenic aerosol emissions have dominated the observed declining trends of countrywide Indian 
summer monsoon rainfall, consistent with findings at the global-monsoon scale (Section 3.3.3.2). 
 
Stronger Northern Hemisphere aerosol emissions cool it relative to the Southern Hemisphere, increasing 
northward energy transport at the expense of moisture transport towards India (Bollasina et al., 2011). The 
attribution to anthropogenic aerosols is supported in CMIP5 single-forcing experiments, including some 
testing the sensitivity to local and remote emissions (Guo et al., 2015, 2016; Shawki et al., 2018), comparing 
CMIP5 GCMs forced by both aerosol and GHG to GHG only (Salzmann et al., 2014) and reducing 
emissions to pre-industrial levels (Takahashi et al., 2018). The large spread between individual model 
realisations of comparable magnitude to the aerosol-induced signal suggested to Salzmann et al. (2014) that 
internal variability may also play a role over regions such as northern-central India. Further uncertainty 
surrounds the level of radiative forcing. Dittus et al. (2020) forced a GCM with historical aerosol emissions 
scaled between 0.2 and 1.5 times their observed values, representing the spread in CMIP5 effective radiative 
forcing. The strongest forcing led to around 0.5 mm day-1 less late-20th century Indian monsoon rainfall than 
the weakest (Shonk et al., 2020). Meanwhile, the uncertainty surrounding aerosol-cloud interactions could 
change the sign of long-term precipitation trends (Takahashi et al., 2018). 
 
There is some evidence that declining Indian monsoon rainfall is due to regional SST warming patterns, 
themselves arising due to radiative forcing from GHG (e.g., in the Indian Ocean, Guemas et al., 2013). Roxy 
et al. (2015) artificially raised SST in a coupled GCM in the equatorial Indian Ocean (the region of strongest 
observed SST warming), leading to a weakened monsoon. Annamalai et al. (2013) used a GCM to suggest 
instead that preferential warming of the western North Pacific may force a Rossby-wave response to its west 
that weakens the monsoon through dry advection and subsidence. These hypotheses are not borne out in 
GHG-forced future projections (Section 10.6.3.6). 
 
A small anthropogenic contribution may be expected from local land-use/land-cover changes and land 
management. India is the world’s most irrigated region with around 0.5 mm/day in places, although peaking  
higher in summer (Cook et al., 2015b; McDermid et al., 2017). Including irrigation in GCMs and RCMs 
slows the monsoon circulation and diminishes rainfall (Lucas-Picher et al., 2011; Guimberteau et al., 2012; 
Shukla et al., 2014; Tuinenburg et al., 2014; Cook et al., 2015b) due to reduced surface temperature (Thiery 
et al., 2017), reducing the monsoon wind and moisture fluxes towards India (Mathur and AchutaRao, 2020). 
However, implementation methodologies for irrigation in climate models are simplified and often do not 
account for spatial heterogeneity while overestimating demand and supply (Nazemi and Wheater, 2015; 
Pokhrel et al., 2016; Section 10.3.3.6). Changing forest cover to agricultural land in an RCM (Paul et al, 
2016) finds weakened summer monsoon rainfall especially in central and eastern India, due to decreased 
local evapotranspiration. Decreased evapotranspiration from a warmer surface since the 1950s in the CMIP5 
ensemble may also feedback on the supply of moisture (Ramarao et al., 2015). Based on a global 
atmospheric GCM study and literature review, Krishnan et al. (2016) support the role of land-use/land-cover 
change in adding to the effects of aerosol in weakening the monsoon, in addition to dynamic effects on the 
circulation caused by rapid warming of the Indian Ocean. 
 
In addition to anthropogenic forcing, there is evidence that internal variability in the Pacific is a significant 
driver. Huang et al. (2020b) compared a large perturbed-physics ensemble (HadCM3C) with a SMILE for 
the historical period. Ensemble members replicating the negative Indian rainfall trend were accompanied by 
a strong phase change in the PDV from negative to positive, consistent with SST observations. Jin and Wang 
(2017) have demonstrated increasing Indian monsoon rainfall since 2002 in a variety of observed datasets, 
suggesting the increase is due either to a change in dominance of a particular forcing (for example from 
aerosol to GHG) or to a change in phase of internal variability such as the PDV. Huang et al. (2020b) 
partially attribute the rainfall recovery to a phase change in the PDV, supported by a SMILE study combined 
with reanalyses (Ha et al., 2020). 
 
The drying trend of Indian summer monsoon rainfall since the mid-20th century can be attributed with high 
confidence to aerosol as the dominant anthropogenic forcing with a further contribution from internal 
variability, supported by the review of Wang et al. (2020) including CMIP6 results. Understanding the 
interplay between anthropogenic and internal drivers will be important for understanding future change. 
 
 
### 10.6.3.6  Future climate projections from global simulations 
 
The AR5 (Christensen et al., 2013) concluded that Indian summer monsoon rainfall will strengthen under all 
RCP future climate scenarios, while the circulation will weaken (medium confidence). SR1.5 (Hoegh-
Guldberg et al., 2018) found only low confidence in projections of monsoon change at 1.5°C and 2°C, or any 
difference between them. The AR6 assessment of Chapter 8 (8.4.2.4.1) finds more precipitation in future 
projections (also depicted in Figure 10.19c,d,e), supported by reviews of CMIP3, CMIP5 and CMIP6 models 
(Turner and Annamalai, 2012; Kitoh, 2017; Chen et al., 2020b; Wang et al., 2020). 
 
Given the assessment for a future wetter monsoon dominated by GHG emissions and attribution of the late-
20th century decline to aerosol (Sections 8.3.2.4.1 and 10.6.3.5), the change between dominant forcings will 
lead, at some point, to a positive trend. For example, RCP4.5 experiments in an atmospheric GCM forced by 
coupled model-derived future SSTs showed continuation of 20th-century drying, before a rainfall recovery 
(Krishnan et al., 2016). By holding aerosol emissions at 2005 levels, lower monsoon rainfall is found 
throughout the 21st century than in a standard RCP8.5 scenario (Zhao et al., 2019), suggesting that the timing 
of the recovery will be partially controlled by the rate at which aerosol emissions decline. The spread in 
spatial distribution of aerosol emissions in SSPs may also play a role in near-term projections (Samset et al., 
2019). Under divergent air-quality policies, SSP3 features a dipole of declining sulphate emissions for China 
but increases over India, leading to suppression of GHG-related precipitation increases there (Wilcox et al., 
2020). For the near-term future around the mid-21st century, the interplay between internal variability and 
external forcing must be considered (Singh and AchutaRao, 2018). Huang et al. (2020a) used two SMILEs to 
show that internal variability related to PDV could potentially overcome the GHG-forced upward trend in 
Indian monsoon rainfall, consistent with assessments of the global monsoon for the near term (Section 
4.4.1.4). Emergence of the anthropogenic signal for South Asian precipitation is shown from the 2050s 
onwards in CMIP6 (Figure 10.15b). 
 
In long-term projections, robust signals consist of a weakened upper-tropospheric meridional temperature 
gradient, either due to upper-level heating over the tropical Pacific (Sooraj et al., 2015) or Indian Oceans 
(Sabeerali and Ajayamohan, 2018) in CMIP5, and increased seasonal mean rainfall, including in CMIP6 
(Almazroui et al., 2020c; Wang et al., 2020). The weakened temperature gradient combines with increased 
atmospheric stability to weaken the monsoon overturning circulation, with some findings showing northward 
movement of the lower-tropospheric monsoon winds in response to a stronger land-sea temperature contrast 
in CMIP3 and CMIP5 (Sandeep and Ajayamohan, 2015; Endo et al., 2018). The northward shift was also 
found in the genesis of synoptic systems (monsoon depressions) in a single high-resolution atmospheric 
GCM forced by an ensemble of SSTs derived from four GCMs under the RCP8.5 scenario (Sandeep et al., 
2018). 
 
Projections can also be expressed in terms of global-mean warming levels (GWLs) rather than time horizons 
(Cross-Chapter Box 11.1). Advancing upon SR1.5, amplification of mean and extreme monsoon rainfall at 
2.0°C compared to 1.5°C has been found both by an atmospheric GCM forced by future SST patterns 
(Chevuturi et al., 2018) and using time slices in CMIP5 GCMs (Yaduvanshi et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 
2020a). These findings are consistent with the general scaling of Indian monsoon precipitation per degree of 
warming in CMIP5 (Zhang et al., 2019) and CMIP6 (Wang et al., 2020). Increasing GWLs also lead to 
emergence of the anthropogenic signal over larger proportions of the South Asian region (Figure 10.15a). 
 
Decomposition of the increased rainfall signal showed that while the dynamic component led to a drying 
tendency, this was overcome by the thermodynamic contribution (Sooraj et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2020b). 
Alternative decomposition experiments using atmospheric GCMs and their coupled counterparts found 
increases in the lower-tropospheric temperature gradient and monsoon rainfall to be dominated by the fast 
radiative response to GHG increase rather than SST changes (Li and Ting, 2017; Endo et al., 2018). The 
response to SST forcing featured a large model spread, particularly arising from the dynamic component (Li 
and Ting, 2017). Chen and Zhou (2015) found that the Indo-Pacific SST warming pattern dominated the 
uncertainty in Indian monsoon rainfall change. Finally, in assessing the relative impact of CO2 radiative 
forcing and plant physiological changes in quadrupled CO2 experiments in four Earth system models, Cui et 
al. (2020) showed little impact of plant physiology on annual rainfall for the Indian region. 
 
While several of the above studies selected model subsets to constrain future projections based on standard 
performance metrics of the historical period, such as pattern correlation and root-mean-square error, Latif et 
al. (2018) included a performance measure based on agreement with historical rainfall trends. This is an 
unproven constraint for regional projections (Section 10.3.3.9), since the 20th-century rainfall trend over 
India is assessed to have been driven chiefly by aerosol and other factors such as PDV (Sections 8.3.2.4.1 
and 10.6.3.5), while the dominant late-21st century forcing is GHG emissions. Modern emergent-constraint 
techniques (Section 10.3.4.2) are being applied to the Indian monsoon such as Li et al. (2017), who found 
that models with excessive tropical western Pacific rainfall tend to project a greater Indian monsoon rainfall 
change in future, due to an exaggerated cloud-radiation feedback. Correcting for this bias reduces the future 
change. 
 
<figref>10.19</figref> 
 
In summary, long-term future scenarios dominated by GHG increases (such as the RCPs) suggest increases 
in Indian summer monsoon rainfall (high confidence), dominated by thermodynamic mechanisms leading to 
increases in the available moisture. In the near-term, there is high confidence (medium agreement, robust 
evidence) that increased rainfall trends due to GHGs could be overcome by aerosol forcing or internal 
variability. 
 
 
### 10.6.3.7  Future climate projections from regional downscaling 
 
Coordinated monsoon-relevant dynamical downscaling efforts such as CORDEX South Asia (Gutowski et 
al., 2016; Choudhary et al., 2018) are relevant to the Indian summer monsoon, first with assessment of their 
added value (Sections 10.3.3.2 and Atlas.5.3.3). Singh et al. (2017) compared nine CORDEX-South Asia 
RCMs against their driving CMIP5 GCMs, for present-day rainfall patterns and processes related to 
intraseasonal variability. They found no consistent improvement other than for spatial patterns (e.g., rainfall 
close to better-resolved orography); some characteristics were made worse. Both the rainfall pattern and its 
bias were worsened in CORDEX compared to CMIP5 in Mishra et al. (2018). In contrast, Varikoden et al. 
(2018) found improved representation of historical rainfall patterns, such as over the Western Ghats 
mountains (consistent with Singh et al., 2017), reducing the dry bias; improvements were not found over the 
northern plains, which are dominated by synoptic variability known as monsoon depressions. Similarly, 
Sabin et al. (2013) compared a uniform 1°-resolution model ensemble with another zoomed to ~35 km over 
South Asia. Local zooming improved simulation of orographic precipitation and the monsoon trough. For the 
future, a surrogate approach (like pseudo-global warming, see Section 10.3.2.2) was used in an RCM to test 
the impacts of warming or moistening on monsoon depressions (Sørland and Sorteberg, 2016; Sørland et al., 
2016). The depressions are found to give more rainfall in future, dominated by strengthened synoptic 
circulation from the warming perturbation. By forcing an RCM with a perturbed parameter ensemble of a 
GCM, Bal et al. (2016) made projections under SRES A1B for the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s. They noted 
increases in rainfall of 15–24% for India. Finally, evidence from a single CORDEX South Asia RCM 
showed a mixed signal for changes in peak season rainfall under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 (Ashfaq et al., 2020). 
 
Statistical downscaling and other post-processing require calibration in historical conditions (e.g., Akhter et 
al., 2019) and assessment of fitness for purpose (Section 10.3.3.9) before use for future projections. Given 
the noted biases in GCM monsoon simulation (Section 10.6.3.5), Vigaud et al. (2013) used a variant of 
quantile mapping to bias adjust (Section 10.3.1.3.2 and Cross-Chapter Box 10.2) GCM outputs. For the 
historical period, the pattern, mean and seasonal cycle of rainfall versus the input GCMs were improved. 
Increased future monsoon rain, albeit in older SRES A2 projections, was found for southern India. Salvi et 
al. (2013) used regression-based perfect prognosis (Section 10.3.1.3.1) for the whole country at 0.5°-
resolution based on five ensemble members of a GCM in SRES scenarios. They noted increases over rainy 
regions of west coast and northeast India, but decreases in the north, west and southeast. Madhusoodhanan et 
al. (2018) statistically downscaled 20 CMIP5 models to 0.05°-resolution. While the GCMs projected 
increased rainfall, the downscaled ensemble depicted both increasing and decreasing trends, indicating 
uncertainty. However, key physical processes operating at below-GCM scale cannot be resolved nor 
calibrated for, such as aspects of the flow around topography. This is notably an issue given the resolution 
disparity between the driving GCMs and output, and the regional challenges in observational data used for 
calibration (Section 10.6.3.3).  
 
There are mixed messages as to whether downscaling adds value to climate projections of the Indian summer 
monsoon; however, there is high confidence in projections of precipitation changes in orographic regions 
given the consistent improved representation in these regions among several dynamical downscaling studies. 
 
 
### 10.6.3.8  Storyline approaches for India 
 
Formal storyline approaches (see Box 10.2) have been used infrequently for the Indian summer monsoon, 
representing a knowledge gap. In an expert-elicitation approach (Dessai et al., 2018), physically plausible 
futures substantiated by climate processes were constructed, focusing on a river basin in southern India. 
Possible outcomes were framed based on changes in two drivers: availability of moisture from the Arabian 
Sea and strength of the low-level flow. The narratives identified were able to explain 70% of the variance in 
monsoon rainfall over 1979–2013, the implication being that climate uncertainties could be easily 
communicated to stakeholders in the context of present-day variability. 
 
The storylines terminology could be used to loosely describe the interplay between internal variability and 
forced change (see Section 10.6.3.6), such as considering the difference between groups of wettest and driest 
ensemble members of a SMILE for the near-term future in Figure 10.19f. However, given the interest in low-
likelihood high-impact scenarios (Sutton, 2018), we can also consider possible storylines for the Indian 
monsoon constructed from evidence in paleoclimate records and modelling. For example, a future AMOC 
collapse could cause reduced monsoon rainfall (Section 8.6.1; Liu et al., 2017), offsetting increases expected 
due to GHG. Large tropical volcanic eruptions are also known to weaken the Asian summer monsoon, in 
observations and model simulations over the last millennium (Section 8.5.2.3; Zambri et al., 2017), although 
a hemispheric dependence is found, with southern hemisphere eruptions even strengthening the monsoon 
around India (Zuo et al., 2019). Typically, future climate projections do not consider plausible eruption 
scenarios and their mitigating effects on greenhouse warming (see also Cross-Chapter Box 4.1). A single-
model ensemble (Bethke et al., 2017) demonstrates a future drier Indian monsoon relative to conditions in 
which volcanic eruptions are not considered, although the effects of GHG warming dominate beyond the 
mid-term. 
 
The few studies on low-likelihood high-impact scenarios, often in single models, together with findings in 
SR1.5 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018), noting the small radiative forcing in 1.5°C or 2°C scenarios, or the 
absence of large aerosol emissions at the end of the 21st century in RCPs, give us low confidence in abrupt 
changes to the monsoon on this time scale. 

 
### 10.6.3.9  Regional climate information distilled from multiple lines of evidence 
 
Above, we presented assessments from observational and model attribution studies of the historical period, 
followed by future climate projections in global and regional models, and storylines approaches including 
low-likelihood high impact events. Miscellaneous lines of evidence are considered here.  
 
Our assessment could also be informed by attempting to constrain future projections of the Indian summer 
monsoon using paleoclimate evidence. In modelling work of the mid-Holocene (D’Agostino et al., 2019), the 
increased obliquity (axial tilt) and altered orbital precession lead to an enhanced monsoon with a stronger 
dynamic component (strengthening the mean monsoon overturning) controlling the increase in monsoon 
rainfall. In future climates however, the dynamic contribution decreases (Section 10.6.3.6), yet the increased 
thermodynamic component (greater moisture availability) overcomes this to cause a wetter monsoon. 
Monsoon changes under different epochs may not be governed by the same mechanisms (D’Agostino et al., 
2019; Hill, 2019), making the mid-Holocene, in particular, unsuitable as a period to compare with. 
 
Finally, the recent national climate-change assessment for India (Krishnan et al., 2020) has distilled multiple 
lines of evidence to show declining summer monsoon rainfall over the second half of the 20th century, 
attributable to emissions of anthropogenic aerosols, while future projections informed by CMIP5 modelling 
and dominated by GHG forcing show increased mean rainfall by the end of the 21st century. 
 
There is very high confidence (robust evidence, high agreement) of a negative trend of summer monsoon 
rainfall over the second half of the 20th century averaged over all of India. There is medium agreement over 
trends at the regional level owing to uncertainty among observational products, which hinders model 
evaluation, downscaling and assessment of changes to extremes. There is high confidence (robust evidence, 
medium agreement) that anthropogenic aerosol emissions over the Northern Hemisphere and internal 
variability have contributed to the negative trend, while there is high confidence (robust evidence, medium 
agreement) that Indian summer monsoon rainfall will increase at the end of the 21st century in response to 
increased GHG forcing, due to the dominance of thermodynamic mechanisms. No contradictory evidence is 
found from downscaling methods. The contrast between declining rainfall in the observational record and 
long-term future increases can be explained using multiple lines of evidence. They are not contradictory 
since they are attributable to different mechanisms (primarily aerosols and greenhouse gases, respectively). 
The long-term future changes are generally consistent across global (including at high resolution) and 
regional climate models, and supported by theoretical arguments; furthermore, while there are subtle 
differences found in past periods with a climate similar to the future climate (the mid-Holocene), different 
physical mechanisms at play suggest that paleoclimate evidence does not reduce confidence in the future 
projections. In the near term, there is high confidence that internal variability will dominate. 
 

## 10.6.4  Mediterranean Summer Warming 
 
### 10.6.4.1  Motivation and regional context 
 
The Mediterranean region is loosely denoted as the region that surrounds the Mediterranean Sea, and it is 
characterized by complex orography and strong land-sea contrasts. The region contains a dense and growing 
human population, with large regional differences: whereas the population of the European Mediterranean 
countries has been relatively stable or even declining during the past decades, the population of countries in 
Mediterranean areas of the Middle East and North Africa has quadrupled between 1960 and 2015, and the 
degree of urbanization has risen from 35 to 64% during the same period (Cramer et al., 2018) and during the 
more recent period 2000-2020 the urban expansion rate has exceeded 5% (Kuang et al., 2021). 
 
The Mediterranean region has experienced significant climate variability over recent decades and has been 
affected in particular by severe heatwaves and droughts (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. (2018); Sections 8.3, 11.3, 
11.6 and 12.4). Increasing summer temperatures will enhance the frequency and intensity of such extreme 
events and will cause additional environmental and socio-economic pressure on the region. 
 
### 10.6.4.2  The region’s climate 
 
The Mediterranean has a heterogeneous climate that is partly semi-arid, especially along the southern coast 
of the Mediterranean Sea (Lionello et al., 2012). It is characterized by mild humid winters and dry warm or 
hot summers, which are associated with large scale subsidence that is partly related to the downward branch 
of the Hadley circulation. Other factors affecting the Mediterranean circulation include the monsoon heating 
over Asia (Rodwell and Hoskins, 1996; Cherchi et al., 2014; Ossó et al., 2019) and circulation anomalies 
induced by topography (Simpson et al., 2015). Seasonal and interannual variability is strongly linked to 
natural modes of variability (Section 10.6.4.4). The Mediterranean Sea acts as an evaporation source that 
dominates the regional hydrological cycle, which is characterized by local cyclogenesis and a separate 
branch of the mid-latitude storm track (Lionello et al., 2016). It also affects remote locations such as the 
Sahel (Park et al., 2016; Section 10.4.2.1). Strong storms can develop over the Mediterranean: among these, 
Medicanes are particularly destructive and exhibit several similarities with tropical cyclones (Cavicchia et 
al., 2014; Kouroutzoglou et al., 2015; Gaertner et al., 2018). The Mediterranean region is also characterized 
by strong land-atmosphere coupling and feedbacks (Seneviratne et al., 2006) generating prolonged droughts 
and intense heatwaves, which can also affect continental Europe (Zampieri et al., 2009). Other aspects of 
Mediterranean climate include regional winds, which can be very strong due to the channelling effect 
(Obermann et al., 2018) and extreme rainfall during autumn (Ducrocq et al., 2014; Ribes et al., 2019). 
 
 
### 10.6.4.3  Observational issues 
 
The Mediterranean region spans a wide variety of countries and economies. This has led to large differences 
in the existence and availability of observational records, with the southern part of the area being sparsely 
covered by meteorological stations (Figure 10.20b). Consequently, basin-wide, homogeneous, quality 
controlled observational datasets are lacking, especially before the advent of substantial satellite observations 
in the 1970s. Observational uncertainties exist also for those regions that are covered by high quality 
networks such as ECA&D (Flaounas et al., 2012). 
 
Large differences of up to 7°C between the CRU and UDEL datasets have been found especially over 
mountainous areas, such as the Atlas in Morocco (Zittis and Hadjinicolaou, 2017; Strobach and Bel, 2019). 
Bucchignani et al., (2016b, 2016a) compared three different datasets (CRU, UDEL, and MERRA) with the 
available ground observations and found that although the geographical distribution of the bias is 
qualitatively similar for the three datasets, differences exist, with the absolute bias being generally lower in 
MERRA especially over North Africa during the summer and winter season. There is high confidence that 
the sparse monitoring network in parts of the Mediterranean region strongly increases the uncertainty across 
different gridded datasets (Section 10.2.2.3, Figure 10.20b,c). 
 
 
### 10.6.4.4  Relevant anthropogenic and natural drivers 
 
The Mediterranean summer climate is affected by large-scale modes of natural variability, the most 
dominant being the NAO (Annex IV) in winter and the summer NAO in summer (Folland et al., 2009; Bladé 
et al., 2012), although regional differences exist. The influence of those modes of variability over the eastern 
Mediterranean is recognized by some studies (Chronis et al., 2011; Kahya, 2011; Black, 2012; Bladé et al., 
2012), but disputed by others (Ben-Gai et al., 2001; Ziv et al., 2006; Donat et al., 2014; Turki et al., 2016; 
Zamrane et al., 2016; Han et al., 2019). During positive summer NAO phase, associated with an upper-level 
trough over the Balkans, the Mediterranean is anomalously wet (Bladé et al., 2012). Drivers of 
Mediterranean climate variability include modes of variability such as the AMV (Sutton and Dong, 2012) 
and the Asian monsoon (Rodwell and Hoskins, 1996; Logothetis et al., 2020). In addition, the increase of 
GHGs (e.g., Zittis et al., 2019), the decrease of anthropogenic aerosols over Europe and the Mediterranean 
since the 1980’s resulting from air pollution policies (Turnock et al., 2016), and anthropogenic land-use 
change (Millán, 2014; Cramer et al., 2020) have been shown to be linked to the regional warming. The role 
of the zonal averaged circulation as a driver for the Mediterranean climate has been stressed by (Garfinkel et 
al., 2020). 
 
The attribution of observed Mediterranean summer warming to above drivers and implications for future 
projections will be discussed in Sections 10.6.4.5 and 10.6.4.6. 
 
 
### 10.6.4.5  Model simulation and attribution over the historical period 
 
Observational datasets show large agreement on the historical (1960-2014) temperature evolution at basin-
wide scale (Figure 10.20e), with an enhanced warming since the 1990’s, and the early decades of the 21st 
century being on average approximately more than 1°C warmer than late 19th century levels (van der Schrier 
et al., 2013; Cramer et al., 2018; Lionello and Scarascia, 2018; Figure 10.20e). Over recent decades, the 
surface air temperature of the Mediterranean including the Mediterranean Sea has warmed by around 0.4°C 
per decade (Macias et al., 2013). Observed trends over land show large geographical heterogeneity (Figure 
10.20d) and notable differences exist amongst different datasets at grid point scale (Figure 10.20c; Qasmi et 
al., 2021). 
 
Several mechanisms have been proposed for the enhanced Mediterranean warming, although their relative 
importance and the possible interplay between them are not fully understood. Circulation changes might 
have contributed to this enhanced warming (Figure 10.20a). Sutton and Dong (2012) argued that the AMV 
induced a shift around the 1990s towards warmer southern European summers. This mechanism is associated 
with a linear baroclinic atmospheric response to the AMV-related surface heat flux. Also O’Reilly et al. 
(2017) related warm summer decades to the AMV, but the connection was shown to be mainly 
thermodynamic. Qasmi et al. (2021) estimate an increase in Mediterranean summer temperature of 0.2-0.8°C 
during a positive AMV. 
  
Increased warming over land compared to the sea is expected due to the lapse-rate changes associated with 
tropospheric moisture contrasts (Kröner et al., 2017; Byrne and O’Gorman, 2018; Brogli et al., 2019a; Figure 
10.20a). Enhanced land-sea temperature contrast leads to relative humidity and soil moisture feedbacks 
(Rowell and Jones, 2006), the latter also depending on weather regimes (Quesada et al., 2012). The globally 
enhanced land-sea contrast in near surface temperature is also a robust result in CMIP5 and CMIP6 models 
(section 4.5.1.1).  
 
Due to its semi-arid climate, strong atmosphere-land coupling has contributed to the larger increase of mean 
summer temperature compared to the increase of annual mean temperature (Seneviratne et al., 2006). In 
particular, during drought spells, limits to evaporation due to low soil moisture provide a positive feedback 
and enhances the intensity of heat waves (Lorenz et al., 2016; Box 11.1). By comparing reanalysis-driven 
RCM simulations with observations, Knist et al. (2017) found that RCMs are able to reproduce soil moisture 
interannual variability, spatial patterns, and annual cycles of surface fluxes over the period 1990–2008, 
revealing a strong land-atmosphere coupling especially in southern Europe in summer. In addition cloud 
feedbacks can modulate the Mediterranean summer temperature (Mariotti and Dell’Aquila, 2012). 
 
The observed trends over 1901‒2010 are outside the range of internal variability shown in CMIP5 pre-
industrial control experiments and consistent with, or greater than those simulated by experiments including 
both anthropogenic and natural forcings (Knutson et al., 2013) and therefore partly attributable to 
anthropogenic forcing. The decrease of anthropogenic aerosols over Europe including the Mediterranean 
resulting from European de-industrialisation and air pollution policies (Turnock et al., 2016) has been 
highlighted as an important contributor to the observed warming (Ruckstuhl et al., 2008; Philipona et al., 
2009; Laat and Crok, 2013; Nabat et al., 2014; Besselaar et al., 2015; Dong et al., 2017; Boé et al., 2020a). 
Pfeifroth et al. (2018) argue that this brightening is mainly due to cloud changes caused by the indirect 
aerosol effect with a minor role for the direct aerosol effect, in contrast to Nabat et al. (2014) and Boers et al. 
(2017) who attribute it to the direct aerosol effect. Using model sensitivity experiments, Nabat et al., (2014) 
also associated the increase in Mediterranean SST since 1980-2012 with the decrease in aerosol 
concentrations (Atlas 8.2, 8.3, 8.5). 
 
Over the period 1960-2014, observed trends over land are consistent with those of most of the multi-model 
or SMILEs ensembles (Figure 10.20f), although large differences exist for individual models and ensemble 
members. The modelled ensemble-mean trends show large geographical variations; generally, both global 
and regional models often underestimate the observed trend especially over part of North Africa, Italy, the 
Balkans and Turkey. The cold bias in GCMs is related to simulated SLP trends that are anti-correlated to the 
observed trend, which is probably due to systematic model errors (Boé et al., 2020b). Biases in the 
simulation of soil-moisture and cloud-cover might also have contributed to the underestimation of the 
warming trend in GCMs (van Oldenborgh et al., 2009). The CORDEX results (at both 0.44 and 0.11 degree 
resolution) show consistently smaller values than those in GCMs and the available data sets (Figure 10.20g; 
Vautard et al., (2020)). This is partly due to the overestimation in the temperature evolution before 1990 
(Figure 10.20e), possibly because of differences in the aerosol forcing (Boé et al., 2020a), although the 
driving GCMs also have a cold bias (Vautard et al., 2020). Cold biases for recent decades are also found in 
Med-CORDEX simulations (Dell’Aquila et al., 2018) and by RCM simulations over the southern part of the 
Mediterranean, Middle East and North Africa region (Almazroui, 2016; Almazroui et al., 2016b, 2016a; 
Ozturk et al., 2018; Zittis and Hadjinicolaou, 2017), although higher resolution, new bare soil albedo and 
modified aerosol parameterization significantly improve the results (Bucchignani et al., 2016b, 2016a, 2018). 
Despite large differences in the multi-model mean trend (Figure 10.20g), in most of the land points the 
observed trend lies within the model range in all ensembles. For the SST bias exhibited by coupled RCMs 
the choice of driving GCM has the largest impact (Darmaraki et al., 2019; Soto-Navarro et al., 2020). 
 
 
### 10.6.4.6  Future climate information from global simulations  
 
The Mediterranean is expected to be one of the most prominent and vulnerable climate change hotspots 
(Diffenbaugh and Giorgi, 2012). CMIP5, CMIP6, HighResMIP and CORDEX (Section 10.6.4.7) simulations 
all project a future warming for the 21st century that ranges between 3.5 and 8.75 °C for RCP8.5 at the end 
of this century for those ending at 2100 (Figure 10.21a,b)). CMIP6 results project more pronounced warming 
than CMIP5 for a given emission scenario and time period (Figure 10.21c; Coppola et al., 2020b). However, 
when analysing the Mediterranean warming in terms of mean global warming levels, the two ensembles 
largely agree showing that summer warming is projected to reach values up to 40-50% larger than the global 
annual warming, largely independent of models and emission scenarios (Figure 10.21d). Large regional 
differences exist, with enhanced warming projected over Turkey, the Balkans, the Iberian Peninsula and 
North African regions (Almazroui et al., 2020a; Figures 10.14a, 10.21c) and reaching, locally, values of up 
to double the global mean (Lionello and Scarascia, 2018). The enhanced summer warming also increases the 
amplitude of the seasonal cycle (Yettella and England, 2018). 
 
As noted in Section 10.6.4.4, the Mediterranean summer climate is affected by large-scale circulation 
patterns, of which the summer NAO is the most important (Folland et al., 2009; Bladé et al., 2012). 
Barcikowska et al. (2020) highlight the importance of correctly simulating the summer NAO impact on the 
Mediterranean climate, as it partly offsets the anthropogenic warming signal in the western and central 
Mediterranean. 
 
Climate models project a reduction in precipitation in all seasons, and a northward and eastward expansion 
of the Mediterranean climate, with the affected areas becoming more arid with an increased summer drying 
(Alessandri et al., 2015; Mariotti et al., 2015; Rajczak and Schär, 2017; Waha et al., 2017; Barredo et al., 
2018; Lionello and Scarascia, 2018; Spinoni et al., 2018, 2020; Atlas 8.5). The drying can contribute to the 
enhanced warming by land-surface feedbacks (Whan et al., 2015; Lorenz et al., 2016; Russo et al., 2019). A 
negative feedback to this dryness induced warming might be provided by an enhanced moisture transport 
into the dry area associated with the dynamical response of the atmosphere (Zhou et al., 2021). Due to the 
arid climate, no positive soil moisture-temperature feedback is found over the North African regions of the 
Mediterranean, where the surface energy budget is mostly governed by radiative cooling (Lelieveld et al., 
2016), implying that soil-moisture feedbacks are not contributing to enhanced warming over those regions. 
 
Over the Mediterranean region, daily maximum temperature is projected to increase more than the daily 
minimum. Consequently, the difference between daytime maxima and night-time minima is expected to 
increase, particularly in summer (Lionello and Scarascia, 2018). Temperature extremes will be affected as 
well, with a dramatic increase in the number of warm days and reduction of cold nights (Lionello and 
Scarascia, 2020; Section 11.9). The Mediterranean summer warming will also increase the frequency and 
intensity of heatwaves (Section 11.9).

### 10.6.4.7  Future climate information from regional downscaling 
 
To unravel the complex interactions and feedbacks over the region on a range of spatial and temporal scales, 
regional downscaling projects are being developed to provide more comprehensive and detailed information 
on the future of the Mediterranean. The importance of regional downscaling for investigating the subregional 
details caused by the complex morphology of the Mediterranean region is a well-known issue in the  
literature (Planton et al., 2012), which has been addressed in many studies since AR5. Recent examples of 
dynamical downscaling are EURO-CORDEX (Jacob et al., 2014) and Med-CORDEX (Ruti et al., 2016; 
Somot et al., 2018), but earlier activities have included ENSEMBLES (Déqué et al., 2012; Fernández et al., 
2019), PRUDENCE (Christensen et al., 2002), CIRCE (Gualdi et al., 2013) and ESCENA (Jiménez-
Guerrero et al., 2013). 
 
From an analysis of CORDEX results, studies showed that southern Europe is projected to face a robust non-
linear increase in temperature larger than the global mean (Zittis et al., 2019), EURO-CORDEX projections, 
that are driven by CMIP5 GCMs, project a less pronounced warming thanthat of CMIP6 (Coppola et al., 
2020a; Figure 10.21c). The non-linear increase is especially evident for both hot and cold extremes (Maule et 
al., 2017; Jacob et al., 2018; Kjellström et al., 2018; Section 11.9). In particular, Dosio and Fischer (2018) 
showed that in many places in southern Europe and the Mediterranean, the increase in the number of nights 
with temperature above 20°C is more than 60% larger under 2°C warming compared to 1.5°C. Over the 
region, the projected temperature increase, including a higher probability of severe heat waves (Russo et al., 
2015), is accompanied by a reduction in precipitation (Jacob et al., 2014; Dosio, 2016; Rajczak and Schär, 
2017), resulting in projected increases of drought frequency and severity (Spinoni et al., 2018, 2020; 
Raymond et al., 2019). Also, the frequency and severity of marine heat waves of the Mediterranean Sea are 
projected to increase (Darmaraki et al., 2019; Section 12.4, Atlas 8.4). 
 
Only a limited number of RCM simulations for the MENA domain are currently available. For the southern 
and eastern Mediterranean, they project a mean warming ranging from 3°C for RCP4.5 to 9°C for RCP8.5 at 
the end of this century compared to its beginning (Bucchignani et al., 2018; Ozturk et al., 2018). The 
frequency and duration of heatwaves and annual number of extremely hot days (i.e., those with maximum 
temperature > 50°C) in the southern Mediterranean will increase substantially. For 2070-2099 with respect to 
1971-2000 the latter might even reach 70 days for RCP8.5 (Lelieveld et al., 2016; Almazroui, 2019; 
Driouech et al., 2020; Varela et al., 2020). 
 
Despite the large efforts of these regional downscaling projects, the GCM-RCM matrix is still sparse and 
lacking a systematic design to explore the uncertainty sources (e.g., GCM, RCM, scenario, resolution) 
(Section 10.3). Focusing on the Iberian peninsula, Fernández et al. (2019) argued that the driving GCM is the 
main contributor to uncertainty in the ensemble. Physically consistent but implausible temperature changes 
in RCMs can occur. An example is a strong temperature increase over the Pyrenees due to excessive snow 
cover in the present climate (Fernández et al., 2019). Based on an older set of RCM simulations 
(ENSEMBLES), Déqué et al. (2012) also argued that the largest source of uncertainty in the temperature 
response over Southern Europe is the choice of the driving GCM (whereas for summer precipitation the 
choice of the RCM dominates the uncertainty). Finally, Boé et al. (2020) found that over a large area of 
Europe, including parts of the Mediterranean, RCMs project a summer warming 1.5–2°C colder than in their 
driving GCMs for the end of the 21st century. This is caused by differences in solar radiation related to the 
absence of time-varying anthropogenic aerosols in RCMs (Boé et al., 2020a; Gutiérrez et al., 2020), which 
also affects the noted differences in cloud cover between GCMs and RCMs (Bartók et al., 2017). 
 
Statistical downscaling studies for the Mediterranean confirm the results from GCM and RCM studies, with 
large agreement among future projections showing lower rates of warming in winter and spring, and, in most 
cases, higher ones in summer and autumn (Jacobeit et al., 2014). 
 
### 10.6.4.8  Storyline approaches 
 
The atmospheric circulation is influenced by large-scale, often slowly varying components of the climate 
system, such as ocean, sea ice and soil moisture. Historical and future changes of the atmospheric circulation 
depend, among other factors, on how these drivers have changed and will change. Zappa and Shepherd 
(2017) have analysed this for the Mediterranean region and developed a set of storylines based on different 
plausible evolutions of those drivers and their impact on the Mediterranean winter climate. Important 
identified drivers during winter are tropical and polar amplification of global warming and the polar 
stratospheric vortex (Manzini et al., 2014; Simpson et al., 2018), with implications for precipitation. Zappa 
(2019) discusses the relative amplitude of tropical and Arctic warming, response of the AMOC, patterns of 
Pacific SST change, and changes in stratospheric vortex strength as possible drivers of the Mediterranean 
summer climate and stresses that given the present state of knowledge, alternative storylines based on these 
drivers should be considered as equally plausible future manifestations of regional climate change. Brogli et 
al. (2019a, 2019b) and Kröner et al. (2017) have revealed thermodynamic processes, lapse rate, and 
circulation as important drivers for Mediterranean summer climate. 
 
Low-likelihood high-impact events might affect future Mediterranean climate. An example of such an event 
is the collapse of the AMOC (Weijer et al., 2019), that would bring widespread cooling over the Northern 
Hemisphere. For the Mediterranean this is estimated to be a few degrees Celsius during summer in the case 
of a total collapse (Jackson et al., 2015).  
 
 
### 10.6.4.9  Climate information distilled from multiple lines of evidence 
 
There is very high confidence (high agreement, robust evidence) that the Mediterranean region has 
experienced a summer temperature increase in recent decades that is faster than the increase for the 
Northern Hemisphere summer mean. There is also very high confidence (high agreement, robust evidence) 
that the projected Mediterranean summer temperature increase will be larger than the global warming level, 
with an increase in the frequency and intensity of heat waves. 
 
Traditionally, the distillation process to produce contextualised, policy relevant information has taken place 
at regional or national level. For example, the potential effects of climate change on public health are 
discussed in several national climate change and adaptation reports (Bruci et al., 2016; MoARE, 2016; MoE, 
2016; MoEP, 2018; MoEU, 2018). Although these reports are extremely helpful and widely used for the 
development of national adaptation policies, they are often based on non-comprehensive and heterogeneous 
sources of climate information (e.g., MEEN, 2018; MoE/UNDP/GEF, 2019): for instance, future climate 
change projections are based on a limited number of socio-economic scenarios and climate model 
simulations, which are also often not evaluated comprehensively (e.g., Bruci ED, 2016; MoARE, 2016; 
MoEU, 2018). In addition, these reports are often not peer-reviewed, not available in English, and mainly 
limited to the country level, thus making it difficult to compare the details of the climate information across 
them.
