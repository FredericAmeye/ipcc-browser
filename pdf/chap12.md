# <goto>12.es</goto> Executive Summary 

*Climate change information is increasingly available and robust at regional scale for impacts and risk 
assessment.* Climate services and vulnerability, impacts, and adaptation studies require regional scale multi-
decadal climate observations and projections. Since AR5, the increased availability of coordinated ensemble 
regional climate model projections and improvements in the level of sophistication and resolution of global 
and regional climate models, completed by attribution and sectoral vulnerability studies, have enabled the 
investigation of past and future evolution of a range of climatic quantities that are relevant to socio-economic 
sectors and natural systems. Chapter 12 consolidates core physical knowledge from preceding AR6 WGI 
chapters and post-AR5 climate impact assessment literature to assess the spatio-temporal evolution of the 
climatic conditions that may lead to regional scale impacts and risks (following the sectoral classes adopted 
by AR6 WGII) in the world’s regions (presented in Chapter 1) {12.1} 
 
*The Climatic Impact-Driver (CID) framework adopted in Chapter 12 allows for assessment of 
changing climate conditions that are relevant for sectoral impacts and risks assessment.* CIDs are 
physical climate system conditions (e.g., means, events, extremes) that affect an element of society or 
ecosystems and are thus a priority for climate information provision. Depending on system tolerance, CIDs 
and their changes can be detrimental, beneficial, neutral, or a mixture of each across interacting system 
elements, regions and society sectors. Each sector is affected by multiple CIDs, and each CID affects 
multiple sectors. A CID can be measured by indices to represent related tolerance thresholds. {12.1-12.3} 
 
*The current climate in most regions is already different from the climate of the early or mid 20th 
century with respect to several CIDs. Climate change has already altered CID profiles and resulted in 
shifts in the magnitude, frequency, duration, seasonality, and spatial extent of associated indices (high 
confidence).* Changes in temperature-related CIDs such as mean temperatures, growing season length, 
extreme heat, frost, have already occurred and many of these changes have been attributed to human 
activities (medium confidence). Mean temperatures and heat extremes have emerged above natural 
variability in all land regions with high confidence. In tropical regions, recent past temperature distributions 
have already shifted to a range different to that of the early 20th century (high confidence). Ocean 
acidification and deoxygenation have already emerged over most of the global open ocean, as has reduction 
in Arctic sea ice (high confidence). Using CID index distributions and event probabilities accurately in both 
current and future risk assessments requires taking into account the climate change–induced shifts in 
distributions that have already occurred {12.4, 12.5} 
 
*Several impact-relevant changes have not yet emerged from the natural variability, but will emerge 
sooner or later in this century depending on the emission scenario (high confidence).* Increasing 
precipitation is projected to emerge before the middle of the century in the high latitudes of the Northern 
hemisphere (high confidence). Decreasing precipitation will emerge in a very few regions (Mediterranean, 
South Africa, South Western Australia) (medium confidence) by the mid-century (medium confidence). The 
anthropogenic forced signal in near-coast relative sea-level rise will emerge by mid-century RCP8.5 in all 
regions with coasts, except in the West Antarctic region where emergence is projected to occur before 2100 
(medium confidence). The signal of ocean acidification in the surface ocean is projected to emerge before 
2050 in every ocean basin (high confidence). However, there is low evidence of emerging drought trends 
above natural variability in the 21st century {12.5}. 
 
*Every region of the world will experience concurrent changes in multiple CIDs by mid-century (high 
confidence), challenging the resilience and adaptation capacity of the region.* Heat, cold, snow and ice, 
coastal oceanic, and CO2 at surface CID changes are projected with high confidence in most regions, 
indicating worldwide challenges, while additional region-specific changes are projected in other CIDs that 
may lead to more regional challenges.  High confidence increases in some of the drought, aridity, and fire 
weather CIDs will challenge, for example, agriculture, forestry, water systems, health and ecosystems in 
Southern Africa, the Mediterranean, North Central America, Western North America, the Amazon regions, 
South-western South America, and Australia. High confidence changes in snow, ice and pluvial or river 
flooding changes will pose challenges for, for example, energy production, river transportation, ecosystems, 
infrastructure and winter tourism in North America, Arctic regions, Andes regions, Europe, Siberia, Central, 
South and East Asia, Southern Australia and New Zealand. Only a few CIDs are projected to change with 
high confidence in the Sahara, Madagascar, Arabian Peninsula, Western Africa, Small Islands; however, the 
lower confidence levels for CID changes in these regions can originate from knowledge gaps or model 
uncertainties, and does not necessarily mean that these regions have relatively low risk. {12.5} 
 
*Worldwide changes in heat, cold, snow and ice, coastal, oceanic and CO2-related CIDs will continue 
over the 21st century, albeit with regionally varying rates of change, regardless of the climate scenario 
(high confidence).* In all regions, there is high confidence that, by 2050, mean temperature and heat extremes 
will increase, and there is high confidence that sea surface temperature will increase in all oceanic regions, 
excepting the North Atlantic. With the exception of a few regions with substantial land uplift, relative sea-
level rise is very likely to virtually certain (depending on the region) to continue along the 21st century, 
contributing to increased coastal flooding in most low-lying coastal areas (high confidence) and coastal 
erosion along most sandy coasts (high confidence), while ocean acidification is virtually certain to increase. 
It is virtually certain that atmospheric CO2 at the surface will increase in all emissions scenarios until net-
zero emissions are achieved. Glaciers will continue to shrink and permafrost to thaw in all regions where 
they are present (high confidence). These changes will lead to climate states with no recent analogue that are 
of particular importance for specific regions such as tropical forests or biodiversity hotspots. {12.4} 
 
*A wide range of region-specific CID changes relative to recent past are expected with high or medium 
confidence, by 2050 and beyond.* Most of these changes are concerning CIDs related to the water cycle and 
storms. Agricultural and ecological drought changes are generally of higher confidence than hydrological 
drought changes, with increases projected in North and Southern Africa, Madagascar, Southern and Eastern 
Australia, some regions of Central and South America, Mediterranean Europe, Western North America and 
North Central America (medium to high confidence). Fire weather conditions will increase by 2050 under 
RCP4.5 or above in several regions in Africa, Australia, several regions of South America,  Mediterranean 
Europe, and North America (medium to high confidence). Extreme precipitation and pluvial flooding will 
increase in many regions around the world (high confidence). Increases in river flooding are also expected in 
Western and Central Europe and in polar regions (high confidence), most of Asia, Australasia and North 
America, South American Monsoon and Southeastern South America (medium confidence). Mean winds are 
projected to slightly decrease by 2050 over much of Europe, Asia, and Western North America, and increase 
in many parts of South America except Patagonia, West and South Africa and Eastern Mediterranean 
(medium confidence). Storms are expected to have a decreasing frequency but increasing intensity over the 
Mediterranean, most of North America, and increase over most of Europe. Enhanced convective conditions 
are expected in North America (medium confidence). Tropical cyclones are expected to increase in intensity 
despite a decrease in frequency in most tropical regions (medium confidence). Climate change will modify 
multiple CIDs for small islands in all ocean basins, most notably those related to heat, aridity and droughts, 
tropical cyclones and coastal impacts.  {12.4} 
 
*The level of confidence in the projected direction of change in CIDs and the intensity of the signal 
depend on mitigation efforts over the 21st century, as reflected by the differences between end-century 
projections for different climate scenarios.* Dangerous humid heat thresholds, such as the NOAA HI of 
41°C, will be exceeded much more frequently under SSP5-8.5 scenario than under SSP1-2.6 and will affect 
many regions (high confidence). In many tropical regions, the number of days per year where a HI of 41°C is 
exceeded will increase by more than 100 days relative to the recent past under SSP5-8.5, while this increase 
will be limited to less than 50 days under SSP1-2.6 (high confidence). The number of days per year where 
temperature exceeds 35°C will increase by more than 150 days in many tropical areas, such as the Amazon 
basin and South-east Asia under SSP5-8.5, while it is expected to increase by less than 2 months in these 
areas under SSP1-2.6 (except for the Amazon Basin). There is high confidence that the total length of sandy 
shorelines around the world that are projected to retreat by more than 100 m will be 35% greater under 
RCP8.5 (~130,000 km) compared to RCP4.5 (~ 95,000 km) by the end of the century. The frequency of the 
present-day 1-in-100-yr extreme sea level (represented here by extreme total water level) event, in a globally 
averaged sense, is projected to become an event that occurs multiple times per year under RCP8.5, while 
under RCP 4.5 it is projected to become a 1-in-5-yr event, representing a 5 fold difference between the two 
RCPs (high confidence).{12.4, 12.5} 

*There is low confidence in past and future changes of several CIDs.* In nearly all regions there is low 
confidence in changes in hail, ice storms, severe storms, dust storms, heavy snowfall, and avalanches, 
although this does not indicate that these CIDs will not be affected by climate change. For such CIDs, 
observations are short-term or lack homogeneity, and models often do not have sufficient resolution or 
accurate parametrizations to adequately simulate them over climate change time scales. {12.4}. 
 
*Many global- and regional-scale CIDs have a direct relation to global warming levels (GWLs) and can 
thus inform the hazard component of ‘Representative Key Risks’ and ‘Reasons for Concern’ assessed 
by AR6 WGII.* These include heat, cold, wet and dry hazards, both mean and extremes; cryospheric hazards 
(snow cover, ice extent, permafrost) and oceanic hazards (marine heatwaves) (high confidence). For some of 
these, a quantitative relation can be drawn (high confidence). For example, with each degree of GSAT 
warming, the magnitude and intensity of many heat extremes show a linear change, while some changes in 
frequency of threshold exceedances are exponential; arctic temperatures warm about twice as fast as GSAT; 
global SSTs increase by ~80% of GSAT change; Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover decreases by ~8% 
per 1°C.  For other hazards (e.g., ice sheet behaviour, glacier mass loss, global mean sea-level rise, coastal 
floods and coastal erosion) the time and/or scenario dimensions remain critical and a simple relation with 
GWLs cannot be drawn (high confidence), but still quantitative estimates assuming specific time frames, 
and/or stabilized GWLs can be derived (medium confidence). Model uncertainty challenges the link between 
specific GWLs and tipping points and irreversible behavior, but their occurrence cannot be excluded and 
their chances increase with warming levels (medium confidence) {CCB 12.1}. 
 
*Since AR5, climate change information produced in climate service contexts has increased 
significantly due to scientific and technological advancements and growing user demand (very high 
confidence).* Climate services involve the provision of climate information in such a way as to assist 
decision-making. These services include appropriate engagement from users and providers, are based on 
scientifically credible information and expertise, have an effective access mechanism, and respond to user 
needs.. Climate services are being developed across regions, sectors, timescales and target users. {12.6} 
 
*Climate services are growing rapidly and are highly diverse in their practices and products (very high 
confidence).* The decision-making context, level of user engagement and co-production between scientists, 
practitioners and intended users are important determinants of the type of climate service developed and its 
utility supporting adaptation, mitigation and risk management decisions. User needs and decision-making 
contexts are very diverse and there is no universal approach to climate services. {12.6} 
 
*Realization of the full potential of climate services is often hindered by limited resources for the co-
design and co-production process, including sustained engagement between scientists, service 
providers and users (high confidence).* Further challenges relate to climate services development, provision 
of climate services, generation of climate service products, communication with users, and evaluation of the 
quality and socio-economic value of climate services. The development of climate services often uncovers 
and presents new research challenges to the scientific community.  {12.6} 

# <goto>12.1</goto>  Framing 
 
Climate change is already resulting in significant societal and environmental impacts and will induce major 
socio-economic damages in the future (AR5 WGII). The society, at large, benefits from information related 
to climate change risks, which enables the development of options to protect lives, preserve nature, build 
resilience and prevent avoidable loss and damage. Climate change can also lead to beneficial conditions 
which can be taken into account in adaptation strategies. 
 
*This chapter assesses climate information relevant to regional impact and risk assessment. It 
complements other WG1 chapters which focus on the physical processes determining changes in the 
climate system and on methods for estimating regional changes.*
 
Impacts of climate change are driven not only by changes in climate conditions, but also by changes in 
exposure and vulnerability (Cross-Chapter Box 1.3). This chapter concentrates on drivers of impacts that are 
of climatic origin (see also SR1.5 (IPCC, 2018), and Section 1.3.2), referred to in WGI as “climatic impact-
drivers” (CIDs). CIDs are physical climate system conditions (e.g., means, events, extremes) that affect an 
element of society or ecosystems. Depending on system tolerance, CIDs and their changes can be 
detrimental, beneficial, neutral, or a mixture of each across interacting system elements and regions. 
However, this chapter largely focuses on drivers commonly connected to hazards, and adopts the IPCC risk 
framework (Chapter 1, Cross-Chapter Box 1.3) since the main objective of the UNFCCC convention is to 
“prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system” (Article 2). 
 
In some cases, risk assessments may require climate information beyond the CIDs identified in this chapter, 
with further impacts or risk modelling often driven by historical climate forcing datasets (e.g., Ruane et al., 
2021) and full climate scenario time series (e.g., Lange, 2019) produced using methods described in Chapter 10.
Chapter 12 focuses on the assessment of a finite number of drivers and how they are projected to evolve 
with climate change, in order to inform impact and risk assessments.  
 
This chapter is new IPCC WGI assessment reports, in that it represents a contribution to the “IPCC Risk 
Framework”. Within this framework, climate-related impacts and risks are determined through an interplay 
between the occurrence of climate hazards and their consequences depending on the exposure of the affected 
human or natural system and its vulnerability to the hazardous conditions. In Chapter 12, we are assessing 
climatic impact-drivers that could lead to hazards or to opportunities, from the literature and model results 
since AR5. This will particularly support the assessment of key risks related to climate change by WGII 
(Chapter 16). Despite the fact that impacts may also be induced by climate adaptation and mitigation policies 
themselves, as well as by socioeconomic trends, changes in vulnerability or exposure, and external 
geophysical hazards such as volcanoes, the focus here is only on ‘climatic’ impacts and risks induced by 
shifts in physical climate phenomena that directly influence human and ecological systems.  
 
This chapter follows the terminology associated with the framing introduced in Chapter 1 (Cross-chapter 
Box 1.2: Baseline and reference periods in AR6) and as found in the AR6 Glossary. The highlighted terms 
below are introduced and used extensively in this chapter: 
 
- *Indices for climatic impact-drivers:* numerically computable indices using one or a combination of 
climate variables designed to measure the intensity of the climatic impact-driver, or the probability 
of exceedance of a threshold. For instance, an index of heat inducing human health stress is the Heat 
Index (HI) that combines temperature and relative humidity (e.g., Burkart et al., 2011; Lin et al., 
2012; Kent et al., 2014) and is used by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA) for issuing heat warnings.  

- *Thresholds for climatic impact-drivers:* an identified index value beyond which a climatic impact-
driver interacts with vulnerability or exposure to create, increase or reduce an impact, risk or 
opportunity. Thresholds can be used to measure various aspects of the climatic impact-driver 
(magnitude or intensity, duration, frequency, timing, and spatial extent of threshold exceedance). For 
instance, a threshold of daily maximum temperature above 35⁰C is considered critical for maize 
pollination and production (e.g., Schauberger et al., 2017; Tesfaye et al., 2017). 

The approach adopted here is consistent with the United Nations ‘Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk 
Reduction 2015-2030’, which aims to face disaster consequences (including, but not limited to climate 
disasters) and reduce risks in natural, managed, and built environments (Aitsi-Selmi et al., 2015; UNISDR, 
2015). The classification of climatic impact-drivers in this chapter is largely consistent with the classification 
of hazards used in the Sendai Framework, however, the UNISDR hazard list spans a wider range of hazards 
inducing damage to society, including hazards that are not directly related to climate (such as volcanoes and 
earthquakes), which are excluded from the assessment herein. Furthermore, the UNISDR classification of 
hazards does not include mean climatic conditions which are also discussed as climatic impact-drivers in this 
chapter. The first priority mentioned in the Sendai Framework is understanding disaster risk as a necessary 
step for action. Facilitating such an understanding is a clear goal of this chapter.  
 
The chapter adopts a regional perspective (continental regions as defined in Chapter 1 and used in WGII, see 
Figure 1.18) on climatic impact-drivers to support decision making across a wide audience of global and 
regional stakeholders in addition to governments (e.g., civil society organizations, public and private sectors, 
academia). While the focus here is on future changes, it also describes current levels and observed trends of 
CIDs as an important point of reference for informing adaptation strategies. 
 
Figure 12.1 summarizes the rationale behind Chapter 12 as the linkage (also referred to as a handshake) 
between WGI and WGII, illustrating how the changing profile of risk may be informed by an assessment of 
climatic impact-drivers, aligning WGI findings on physical climate change with WGII needs. The 
implementation of mitigation policy shifts may modulate hazard probability changes (i.e., by reducing 
emissions to limit global warming) as well as regional vulnerability and exposure. The assessment herein is 
organized around regional climatic impact-drivers, but also relates key indices and thresholds to increasing 
global drivers (such as mean surface warming) as a contribution to the assessment of ‘Reasons for Concern’ 
in WGII (O’Neill et al., 2017).  
 
<figref>12.1</figref> 
 
The narrative in Chapter 12 is illustrated in Figure 12.2. First, Section 12.2 defines a range of climatic 
impact-driver categories that are relevant for regional and sectoral impacts and the associated ECVs. Next, 
Section 12.3 identifies climatic impact-drivers and their relevant indices that are frequently used in the 
context of climate impacts in the WGII focus sectors (Chapters 2-8). The assessment of changes in regional-
scale climatic impact-drivers is then developed within Section 12.4 by continent, following the structure of 
the WGII assessment report regional chapters (Chapters 9-15), and adding the polar regions, open/deep 
ocean and other specific zones corresponding to the WGII cross-chapter papers. Section 12.5 then presents a 
global perspective (both bottom-up and top-down) on the change of regional climatic impact-drivers, 
including an assessment of the “emergence” of climatic impact-drivers. Section 12.6 discusses how climate 
information is used in ‘climate services’, which encompasses a range of activities bridging climate science 
and its use for adaptation and mitigation decision making (see also AR6 WGII Chapter 17). The chapter 
concludes with final remarks in Section 12.7. 

<figref>12.2</figref> 
 
The chapter includes two Cross-Chapter boxes. Cross-chapter Box 12.1 connects climatic impact-drivers 
them to global climate drivers and levels of warming as an element of the ‘Reasons for Concern’ framework 
(AR6 WGII Chapter 16). An additional cross-chapter box, including three case studies from Europe, Asia 
and Africa, describes how climate services draw upon and apply regional climate information to support 
stakeholder decisions (Cross-Chapter Box 12.2). 
 
 
# <goto>12.2</goto>  Methodological approach 
 
This section details the methodological approach followed in Chapter 12 and discusses the underlying 
rationale for the assessments presented herein. Scientific literature on vulnerability, impacts, and adaptation 
(as typically asssessed in IPCC WGII) is examined to identify relevant climatic impact-drivers (CIDs) that 
contribute to sectoral risks and opportunities. Projected changes in corresponding CID indices are then 
derived from existing literature on changes in the physical climate system, results of other AR6 WGI 
chapters, and direct calculations based on climate projections from several model ensembles. 
 
The classification of climatic impact-drivers, the ways that they change (e.g., their magnitude or intensity, 
duration, frequency, timing, and spatial extent) is described in this section. It is emphasized that this chapter 
only assesses literature relating to physical climatic impact-drivers, not their impacts on human systems or 
the environment. Thus, here we do not consider indicators including exposure or vulnerability as assessed by 
WGII, although the selection of climatic impact-drivers is informed by literature feeding into WGII. 
 
Chapter 12 assesses climate information relevant for impact and for risk assessment in the seven main 
sectors corresponding to Chapters 2-8 of the WGII assessment report: 

- Terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and their services (WGII Chapter 2); 
- Ocean and coastal ecosystems and their services (WGII Chapter 3); 
- Water (WGII Chapter 4); 
- Food, fibre and other ecosystem products (WGII Chapter 5); 
- Cities, settlements and key infrastructure (WGII Chapter 6); 
- Health, wellbeing and the changing structure of communities (WGII Chapter 7); 
- Poverty, livelihoods and sustainable development (WGII Chapter 8). 

 
Many of these sectors also include assets affected by climate change that are important for recreation and 
tourism, including elements of ecosystems services, health and wellbeing, communities, livelihoods, and 
sustainable development (see also Chapter 1 on the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on 
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), and the IPCC Special Report on climate change, 
desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in 
terrestrial ecosystems (Hurlbert et al., 2019; IPCC, 2019c).  
 
CIDs can be captured in seven main types: heat and cold, wet and dry, wind, snow and ice, coastal, oceanic 
and others. Table 12.1 provides an overview of the seven CID types and the CID categories associated with 
each type. The type “Other” comprises additional CIDs that are not encompassed with the above six CID 
types, including air pollution weather (e.g., meteorological conditions that favour high concentrations of 
surface ozone, particulate matter, or other air pollutants), near-surface atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and 
mean radiation forcing at the surface, for instance relevant for plant growth. Icebergs, fog and lightning are 
also noted in this chapter but are not broadly assessed across all sub-sections. In addition, there can be 
changes in impacts associated with earthquakes that interact with climate variables and climate change, such 
as liquefaction (e.g., Yasuhara et al., 2012) during earthquakes, or earthquakes caused by snow and water 
changes (Amos et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2017), which are secondary effects on geophysical hazards that 
are not further assessed in this chapter.  The characteristics and physical description of the climate 
phenomena or essential climate variables associated with each of these CID categories are assessed and 
described in previous Chapters 2-11 or Chapter 12 directly as indicated in Table 12.1. The CID categories 
are further mapped onto different sectors in section 12.3 (Table 12.2). 
 
<tableref>12.1</tableref> 
 
Potential changes in the seasonality of CIDs or the length and characteristics of seasons (e.g. changes in 
growing season length or pollen season) are also important as they may shift the timing of many CIDs with 
broad implications for sectors and regional stakeholders (Wanders and Wada, 2015; Cassou and Cattiaux, 
2016; Hansen and Sato, 2016; Brönnimann et al., 2018; Marelle et al., 2018; Unterberger et al., 2018; Kuriqi 
et al., 2020). Episodic CIDs characterize impact-relevant conditions persisting from short to long time 
frames but eventually returning to normal conditions. 
 
In some situations, phenomena causing severe impacts go well beyond a single extreme event or a single 
climate variable, and can include interaction of climatic conditions, such as sea level rise and storm surges 
(Wahl et al., 2015), precipitation in combination with strong winds (Martius et al., 2016) or flooding quickly 
followed by a heat wave (Wang et al., 2019c) (see also section 10.5.2.4). Such compound events, particularly 
in context of climate extremes, are assessed in section 11.8. A combination of non-extreme climatic impact-
drivers in time or space can also lead to severe impacts (Cutter, 2018).  
 
Several climatic impact-drivers are reliant on many factors beyond their associated primary climatic 
phenomenon. For example, river flooding is heavily dependent on river management and engineering and 
could also be affected by tidal water levels due to sea level rise and/or storm surge. Coastal flooding could be 
affected by coastal protection structures, port and harbour structures as well as river flows (on inlet-
interrupted coasts). Coastal erosion could be influenced by coastal protection measures as well as fluvial 
sediment supply to the coast. Furthermore, air pollution weather is not the only or dominant driver, for 
instance, of surface ozone pollution, but precursor emissions from anthropogenic sources can play a 
significant role (see section 6.5). Chapter 12 focuses only on the influence of the atmospheric, land and 
oceanic conditions associated with the climatic impact-drivers and the confidence in the direction of CID 
changes given here does not take into account existing or potential future adaptation measures, unless 
otherwise stated. 
 
For each CID category there can be a range of indices that capture the sector- or application-relevant 
characteristics of a climatic impact-driver as described in sections 12.3 and 12.4. Indices for climatic impact-
drivers that are based on absolute or percentile thresholds (e.g. daily maximum temperature above 35⁰C) can 
be affected by biases in climate model simulations, such as local or regional deviations of a simulated 
climate variable from observed values (Sillmann et al., 2014; Dosio, 2016). Where sensible (i.e., where 
reliable observational data is available and a climate model that fits for the desired purpose), the output of 
climate model simulations can be bias-adjusted, potentially involving advanced methods to account for 
multiple variables and extreme value statistics as assessed in detail in Cross-chapter box 10.2. Yet, there is 
no general agreement about which bias adjustment methods to apply, as artefacts can arise both from the 
climate model and from the bias adjustment method, and the number of available methods has considerably 
grown in recent years (see a detailed discussion of available methods and their performance in Chapter 10 
sections 10.3.1.3 and 10.3.3.7 and in Cross-chapter box 10.2). The WGI Interactive Atlas illustrates original 
and bias-adjusted CIDs (see Atlas.1.4.5) and underlying methods are further described in Technical Annex 
VI.  
 
A global perspective on climatic impact-drivers related to their evolution for different global warming levels 
(see section 1.6) is provided in section 12.5.1. Section 12.5.2 focuses on assessing evidence for the 
emergence (see section 1.4.2.2) of an anthropogenic climate change signal on the change in CIDs beyond 
natural climate variability, based on the literature assessed in other chapters and additional literature, at both 
global and regional scales. The process of generating user-relevant regional climate information in context of 
co-production and climate services is assessed in sections 10.5, 12.6, Box 10.2 and Cross-chapter boxes 10.3 
and 12.2. 
 
 
# <goto>12.3</goto>  Climatic impact-drivers for sectors 
 
Climate change becomes relevant for regional impact management and for risk assessment when changes in 
mean conditions or episodic events affect natural and societal assets (system components with 
socioeconomic, cultural, or intrinsic value) positively or negatively (Table 12.2). Decision makers, policy 
makers, risk managers and engineers therefore benefit from climate information that tracks key trends and 
exceedance of thresholds that represent crucial challenges for natural and human systems. While useful 
indices can vary widely for a given sector and precise tolerance threshold values are often unknown, 
common metrics, categories and progressions of threshold levels allow experts to recognize coherent 
messages concerning altered regional impacts and risk profiles under climate change.   
 
This section surveys the links between CIDs and affected sectors; not to perform specific climate change 
impact or risk assessments (see AR6 WGII), but to describe key indices (among many) that quantify these 
links as guidance for stakeholders seeking applicable climate information. This survey builds on the work of 
the World Meteorological Organization Expert Team on Sector-Specific Climate Indices (ET-SCI) and 
previous IPCC assessments, notably AR5 WGII (Birkmann et al., 2014; IPCC, 2014a) and IPCC Special 
Reports (IPCC, 2018, 2019b, 2019c) that have assessed climate hazards affecting sectors but is organized 
from a CID perspective drawing also upon recent summaries of sectoral hazards (Mora et al., 2018; 
ICOMOS, 2019; Yokohata et al., 2019). Impacts, risks, and opportunities are rarely attributable to a single 
CID index or threshold, but climate shifts that push conditions outside of expected conditions and beyond 
tolerance levels are indicative of impact, risk, or benefit given vulnerability and exposure. Focus is on direct 
sectoral connections of a CID (Hallegatte and Przyluski, 2010) rather than cascading or secondary effects 
(e.g., water-borne diseases following a flood, mental health challenges following a severe storm, or the 
effects of drought on poverty), as these are strongly affected by exposure, vulnerability, and response, as 
discussed in WGII report. 
 
Table 12.2 presents a summary of Section 12.3 connections between CIDs as defined in Table 12.1 and key 
sectoral assets, utilizing the WGII organization of sectors (corresponding to WGII chapters 2-8). Colours are 
shown for connections with at least medium confidence as assessed from sectoral impacts and risk literature, 
with relevance assessed according to the prominence of that specific CID/asset connection in analyses of 
current and future impacts and risk. Within each sector there is a multitude of specific sectoral systems that 
may be affected by CID increases and decreases, with consequences further distinguished by region, 
background climate, and socioeconomic or ecological context of the affected asset.  Our aim is therefore to 
recognize important drivers and the common attributes of change within each CID that scientists and 
practitioners monitor to understand current and future challenges for important asset groups, thereby pointing 
to the climate information that needs to be tailored and analysed for impacts and for risk assessment (Section 
12.6).  Additional effects whereby CIDs affect each other (across Table 12.2 columns) are discussed as 
climatic phenomena within WGI.  The ways sectoral assets affect each other (across Table 12.2 rows) are 
described throughout WGII, for example with information about the suitability of future climate zones and 
climate velocity challenges for a given asset potentially drawing from multiple CIDs and associated system 
tolerance thresholds (Hamann et al., 2015). Some broad connections indicated as low confidence may be 
under-represented in the literature or could be acute under specific circumstances.

## 12.3.1  Heat and cold 
 
### 12.3.1.1  Mean air temperature 
 
Information about increasing mean annual and seasonal air temperature is relevant in the determination of 
suitable species range for terrestrial, freshwater, and intertidal species (Thomas et al., 2004; Elith et al., 
2010; Hincapie and Caicedo, 2013; Cooper, 2014; Krist et al., 2014; Lindner et al., 2014; Saintilan et al., 
2014; Urban, 2015; Lenoir and Svenning, 2015; Myers-Smith et al., 2015; Thorne et al., 2017). Ocean 
ecosystems are affected by the ocean temperature CID (described in Section 12.3.6.1). Species redistribution 
and extinction studies also need information about climate velocity, a comparison of the pace of warming to 
geographical temperature gradients that indicates the rate at which a species would have to move to maintain 
its climatological temperature (Thomas et al., 2004; Loarie et al., 2009; Dobrowski et al., 2013; Burrows et 
al., 2014; Dobrowski and Parks, 2016; Sittaro et al., 2017) with some studies incorporating additional 
variables beyond temperature (Hamann et al., 2015). Many freshwater ecosystems are strongly constrained 
by stream and lake temperatures (Scheurer et al., 2009; Comte and Grenouillet, 2013; Contador et al., 2014; 
Knouft and Ficklin, 2017). Warmer and more stratified lake temperatures are more conducive to 
cyanobacteria blooms with implications for ecosystem health and water resource quality (Whitehead et al., 
2009; Moss, 2011; Jones and Brett, 2014; Chapra et al., 2017; Shatwell et al., 2019).  Consideration of night-
time and daytime temperature trends also elucidates different biophysical effects on vegetation (Peng et al., 
2013).  Changes in the seasonal timing caused by warming trends are critical to species ranges and 
ecosystem function (Pearce-Higgins et al., 2015; Hughes et al., 2017b), and indices that characterise the 
onset of spring shed light on plant emergence and development (Ault et al., 2015).  
 
Mean air temperature dictates many aspects of crop cultivation, livestock production, agroforestry, and 
output from freshwater aquaculture and fisheries as well as the potential for food contamination.  Mean 
warming alters suitable cultivation zones for crop species (Bragança et al., 2016; Gendron St-Marseille et al., 
2019; IPCC, 2019c) and tree species (Hanewinkel et al., 2013; Fei et al., 2017). Crop and ecosystem service 
productivity often responds directly to mean temperatures, although this is dependent on farming system 
(Bassu et al., 2014; Challinor et al., 2014; Lobell and Tebaldi, 2014; Rosenzweig et al., 2014; Asseng et al., 
2015; Li et al., 2015; Fleisher et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2017; Smith and Fazil, 2019). Many studies relate 
plant development (phenology), insect generation cycles, and pest outbreaks to growing degree days, an 
aggregation of daily thermal units above a threshold (e.g., Tmean>5℃) that accelerates with warmer 
conditions (Hof and Svahlin, 2016; Ruosteenoja et al., 2016; Tripathi et al., 2016). Many plants respond to 
changes in night-time temperatures that affect respiration and transpiration rates (Narayanan et al., 2015; 
Chen et al., 2019b), and warming of the soil column is also relevant to determine plant sprouting (Grotjahn, 
2021). A number of indices have been developed to represent the length of the viable local growing season, 
including a count of days where Tmax > 5℃ (Mueller et al., 2015) or the period between a year’s first and 
last set of 5 consecutive days with a weighted Tmean ≥ 10℃ (Li et al., 2018b). Warmer conditions and 
altered seasonality modify the range and metabolism of some pollinators, pests, diseases and weeds (Wolfe 
et al., 2008; Bebber, 2015; Aljaryian and Kumar, 2016; IPBES, 2016; Ramesh et al., 2017; Deutsch et al., 
2018; Nyangiwe et al., 2018) and may reduce the effectiveness of winter storage for farmers and caching 
species (Sutton et al., 2016).   
 
Warming raises accumulated seasonal heat indices used in livestock production, especially when humidity is 
high (Key et al., 2014; Lallo et al., 2018), determines aquaculture suitability and is important for wild fish 
species migration (Tripathi et al., 2016; Brander et al., 2017). Agricultural planners may also calculate how 
overall warming trends alter the accumulation of vernalization units or chilling hours for agricultural or 
horticultural crops (often accumulated temperature deficit below a given daily or hourly threshold) (Dennis 
and Peacock, 2009; Luedeling, 2012; Tripathi et al., 2016; Grotjahn, 2021). Warming in the post-harvest is 
also important for the determination of spoilage and waste (Stathers et al., 2013) as well as food-borne 
diseases (Kovats et al., 2004; Mbow et al., 2019).   
 
Warming affects road degradation rates (Chinowsky and Arndt, 2012; Espinet et al., 2016) and warming 
rates informs designs for long-term energy efficiency of buildings (Kalvelage et al., 2014). Mean 
temperature drives seasonal energy demand, often expressed using wintertime heating degree days (the 
accumulated deficit of daily temperatures below a ‘comfortable’ indoor temperature, e.g., 15.5℃) and 
summertime cooling degree days (the accumulated excess of temperature above a ‘comfortable’ level, e.g., 
18℃) (Spinoni et al., 2015; Arnell et al., 2019). Energy resources may also need information on warming 
trends to determine suitable zones and overall productivity for biofuels and solar panels whose efficiency 
decreases with higher temperatures (Schaeffer et al., 2012; Wild et al., 2015; Solaun and Cerdá, 2019).   
 
Health impacts and risk studies compare seasonal temperature conditions to limiting thresholds to understand 
range shifts and incubation rates for pathogens, disease vectors, and zoonotic hosts (e.g., mosquitos, ticks; 
Caminade et al., 2012, 2014; Eisen and Moore, 2013; Lima et al., 2016; Ogden, 2017; Monaghan et al., 
2018) and warming of surface ocean and lake waters conducive to bacterial outbreaks (Baker-Austin et al., 
2013; Jacobs et al., 2015; Vezzulli et al., 2015).  Warmer conditions can also affect tourism (Kovács et al., 
2017) and impact human health by lengthening the allergy season and increasing pollen concentration 
(Hamaoui-Laguel et al., 2015; Kinney et al., 2015a; Lake et al., 2017; Upperman et al., 2017; Sapkota et al., 
2019; Ziska et al., 2019).   
 
### 12.3.1.2  Extreme heat 
 
Impacts and risk assessments utilize a large variety of indices and approaches tailored to evaluate heat 
impacts on human health (Sanderson et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2018a; McGregor and Vanos, 2018; Staiger et 
al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2019; Schwingshackl et al., 2021). A mixture of simple and complex heat stress indices 
often combine extreme temperatures and high humidity to capture human health challenges (Aström et al., 
2013; Chow et al., 2016; Dahl et al., 2017a; Im et al., 2017; Coffel et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018c; Vanos et al., 
2020).  Different optimum temperatures and extreme heat thresholds based on local distributions are needed 
to reflect acclimation of different locations and populations (Cheng et al., 2018; Dosio, 2017; Hajat et al., 
2014; Kinney et al., 2015b; Lay et al., 2018; Petitti et al., 2016; Russo et al., 2015; Schwingshackl et al., 
2021; WHO, 2014).  Hot and humid heat episodes can be deadly (Mora et al., 2017), are associated with 
elevated hospital intake (Goldie et al., 2017) and lower safety and productivity of outdoor labourers (Dunne 
et al., 2013; Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2014; Kjellstrom et al., 2016; Pal and Eltahir, 2016; Zhao et al., 2016b; 
Mora et al., 2017; Watts et al., 2018; Orlov et al., 2019).  Elevated night-time temperatures prevent the 
human body from experiencing relief from heat stress (Zhang et al., 2012) and can be tracked over extended 
periods of sequential day and night heat extremes (Murage et al., 2017; Mukherjee and Mishra, 2018). 
Extreme heat also exacerbates asthma, respiratory difficulties, and response to airborne allergens such as hay 
fever (Upperman et al., 2017). Extreme heat affects outdoor exercise such as the use of bike-share facilities 
(Heaney et al., 2019; Vanos et al., 2020). Large-scale recreational and sporting events such as marathons and 
tennis tournaments monitor heat extremes when determining the viability of host cities (Smith et al., 2016, 
2018).   
 
Short-term exposure of crops to temperatures beyond a critical temperature threshold can lead to lower 
yields and above a limiting temperature threshold, crops may fail altogether (Schlenker and Roberts, 2009; 
Lobell et al., 2012, 2013; Gourdji et al., 2013; Deryng et al., 2014; Schauberger et al., 2017; Tesfaye et al., 
2017; Vogel et al., 2019). The exact level of these thresholds depends on species, cultivar, and farm 
management (Hatfield and Prueger, 2015; Hatfield et al., 2015; Bisbis et al., 2018; Grotjahn, 2021). The 
timing of heatwaves is particularly important, as extreme heat is more damaging during critical phenological 
stages (Eyshi Rezaei et al., 2015; Fontana et al., 2015; Mäkinen et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017). Extreme 
canopy temperatures, rather than 2 m air temperatures, may be a more robust biophysical indicator of heat 
impacts on crop production (Siebert et al., 2017). Heat stress indices based upon temperature and humidity 
determine livestock productivity as well as conception and mortality rates (Dash et al., 2016; Key et al., 
2014; Pragna et al., 2017; Rojas-Downing et al., 2017).   
 
Heat extremes factor in mortality, morbidity and the range of some thermally sensitive ecosystem species 
(Smith and Nagy, 2015; Ratnayake et al., 2019; Thomsen et al., 2019). Combined heat and drought stress 
can reduce forest and grassland primary productivity (Ciais et al., 2005; De Boeck et al., 2018) and even 
cause tree mortality at higher extremes (Teskey et al., 2015).  
 
Extreme heat events raise temperatures in buildings and cities already warmed by the urban heat-island 
effect (Gaffin et al., 2012; Oleson et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018; Mauree et al., 2019; Box 10.3) and can 
induce disruptions in critical infrastructure networks (Chapman et al., 2013). Heat affects transportation 
infrastructure by warping roads and airport runways (Chinowsky and Arndt, 2012) or buckling railways 
(Dobney et al., 2010; Dépoues, 2017; Chinowsky et al., 2019), and high temperatures reduce air density 
leading to aircraft take-off weight restrictions (Coffel et al., 2017; Palko, 2017; Zhou et al., 2018b). Heat 
extremes increase peak cooling demand and challenge transmission and transformer capacity (Sathaye et al., 
2013; Russo et al., 2016; Craig et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2018b) and may cause transmission lines to sag or fail 
(Gupta et al., 2012). Thermal and nuclear electricity plants may be challenged when using warmer river 
waters for cooling or when mixing waste waters back into waterways without causing ecosystem impacts 
(Kopytko and Perkins, 2011; van Vliet et al., 2016; Tobin et al., 2018).  Extreme temperature can also reduce 
solar photovoltaic efficiency (Jerez et al., 2015). 
 
 
### 12.3.1.3  Cold spells 
 
The magnitude and timing (relative to developmental stages) of cold extremes (such as the typical coldest 
day of the year) set limits in the range of species habitat for ecosystems as well as for agricultural and forest 
pests (Osland et al., 2013; Cavanaugh et al., 2014; Parker and Abatzoglou, 2016; Brunner et al., 2018; 
Unterberger et al., 2018). Cold air outbreaks can lead to chilling injuries for crops (even above 0℃) and may 
kill outdoor livestock (particularly young animals) (Mader et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2013; Grotjahn, 2021), but 
are often necessary for crop chill requirements (Dennis and Peacock, 2009).   
 
Increases in human mortality can occur on exceptionally cold days (e.g., <1st percentile of temperatures in 
winter) although thresholds and human-perceived temperatures linked to wind speed (i.e., ‘wind chill’) vary 
geographically due to acclimatization (Li et al., 2013b, 2018c; Gao et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2019a). The 
timing of ‘unseasonal’ cold spells also affect human health (Kinney et al., 2015b). Extreme cold can increase 
heat and electricity demand (Stuivenvolt-Allen and Wang, 2019),  cause water pipes to burst , and 
mechanically alter roads, railroads and buildings (Underwood et al., 2017). 
 
 
### 12.3.1.4  Frost 
 
Frost (Tmin < 0 ℃) is a natural and fundamental aspect of many ecosystems, with more extreme conditions 
defined as ice (or icing) days (Tmax < 0 ℃) (Vincent et al., 2018c). Agricultural systems planning (e.g., 
planting calendars, seed selection, or the opportunity to double-crop) requires information about the start and 
end of the frost-free season (Wypych et al., 2017; Wolfe et al., 2018). Crops and wild plants can be directly 
damaged by frost, but hard or killing frosts (at a threshold several degrees below freezing) can kill crops or 
lower harvest quality depending on duration (which relates to soil temperature penetration) and plant 
developmental stage (Crimp et al., 2016; Cradock-Henry, 2017; Li et al., 2018c; Mäkinen et al., 2018; 
Grotjahn, 2021). Earlier disappearance of snow cover reduces natural insulation that protects plants and 
burrowing animals from hard frost damages (Trnka et al., 2014; Mäkinen et al., 2018). In some cases an 
early season warm spell may reduce plant hardiness or induce fruit tree flowering that exposes plants to 
devastating subsequent frost impacts (Hufkens et al., 2012; Hatfield et al., 2014; Tripathi et al., 2016; 
Brunner et al., 2018; DeGaetano, 2018; Unterberger et al., 2018; Wolfe et al., 2018).  Shifts in the 
seasonality of frozen soils also affect groundwater recharge and surface streamflow for water resource 
applications, particularly when peak precipitation is shifted to a season that no longer has frozen soils 
(Jyrkama and Sykes, 2007). 

Regional information about the spring and autumn seasonal periods in which freeze-thaw cycles are common 
(such as the dates of first spring thaw and last spring frost, or the number of days where Tmax > 0 ℃ and Tmin 
< 0 ℃) are particularly useful in estimating the rate of potential road and building damages or determining 
seasonal truck weight restrictions (Kvande and Lisø, 2009; Chinowsky and Arndt, 2012; Palko, 2017; Daniel 
et al., 2018).  The altitude of the freezing level also identifies portions of mountain slopes where freeze/thaw 
transitions or changes in snowpack condition can influence landslide and snow avalanche hazards (Coe et al., 
2018). The geographical distribution of frost is also a determining factor in the range of vectors for human 
diseases such as malaria (Zhao et al., 2016a; Smith et al., 2020). 
 
Figure 12.3 illustrates how successive heat and cold hazards can potentially affect important natural and 
human systems, with climatic pressures reaching new sectoral assets or becoming increasingly severe as 
conditions become more extreme. While the precise value of any CID threshold may depend strongly on 
local environmental and system characteristics, there are common patterns and interdependencies in the 
types of thresholds encountered. Changes in the regional profile of CIDs can thus substantially alter 
threshold exceedance likelihoods.  
 
<figref>12.3</figref> 
 
## 12.3.2  Wet and dry 
 
### 12.3.2.1  Mean precipitation 
 
Changes in mean precipitation alter total water resources and long-term surface, snowpack, and groundwater 
reservoirs (Schewe et al., 2014a). Annual and seasonal wet trends can alter the suitable geographic range of 
species, with implications for biodiversity and vector borne disaeses (Knouft and Ficklin, 2017; Smith et al., 
2020). The rate at which higher total stream flow increases river erosion and changes sediment loading is 
relevant for fish breeding (Scheurer et al., 2009), the location of riverine salt fronts that affect coastal 
agriculture and ecosystems (Chun et al., 2018; Vu et al., 2018), coastal freshwater stratification (Baker-
Austin et al., 2013; Bell et al., 2013), and the accretion of sediment in estuaries and beaches (Syvitski and 
Milliman, 2007). Wetter conditions may shift tourist appeal (Kovács et al., 2017) and alter the pace of 
degradation for paved and especially unpaved roads (Chinowsky and Arndt, 2012).   
 
Many agricultural systems require minimum rainfall totals or rely upon irrigation (Mbow et al., 2019). The 
length of the wet season helps determine the potential for multiple cropping seasons, but inconsistency of 
wet season arrival times poses challenges for farm management (Waha et al., 2020).  Wetter growing season 
conditions increase the chance of water logging, which can delay planting or damage planted seeds 
(Rosenzweig et al., 2002; Ben-Ari et al., 2018; Mäkinen et al., 2018; Wolfe et al., 2018; Kolberg et al., 2019; 
Grotjahn, 2021). Tomasek et al. (2017) calculated ‘workable days’ for agricultural machinery around 
planting and harvest time set in part by limits in soil moisture saturation below which farmers can utilize 
critical machinery with less rutting or soil compaction. Wetter conditions may also increase canopy moisture 
that is conducive to crop pathogens (Garrett et al., 2006; Kilroy, 2015; Grotjahn, 2021). 
  
 
### 12.3.2.2  River flood 
 
A large variety of climate indices and models are utilized to understand how river flooding affects both 
natural or built environments with highly variable hazard thresholds, given unique local topography and 
engineered defences such as dams and polders (Arnell and Gosling, 2016; Ekström et al., 2018).. Key 
transportation routes, built infrastructure, and agricultural lands are threatened when floods exceed design 
standards commonly based around flood magnitudes of a given historic return period (e.g., 1-in-100 yr flood 
event), an annual exceedance probability, or precipitation intensity-duration-frequency relationships with key 
indices (e.g., 10-day cumulative precipitation) related to catchment size and properties (Hirabayashi et al., 
2013; Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes, 2014; Kundzewicz et al., 2014; Arnell and Gosling, 2016; Dikanski et al., 
2016; Gosling and Arnell, 2016; Forzieri et al., 2017; Fluixá-Sanmartín et al., 2018; Koks et al., 2019). 
Floods and high flow events can scour river beds and elevate silt loads, reducing water quality and 
accelerating deposition in estuaries and reservoirs (Khan et al., 2018; Parasiewicz et al., 2019). Floods can 
knock down, drown, or wash away crops and livestock, and partially-submerged plants can have yield 
reduction depending on water turbidity and their development stage (Ruane et al., 2013; Shrestha et al., 
2019). Basin snowpack properties may also be important during heavy rain events, as rain-on-snow events 
can lead to rapid acceleration of flood stages that threaten wildlife and society (Hansen et al., 2014). 
 
 
### 12.3.2.3  Heavy precipitation and pluvial flood 

Heavy downpours can lead to pluvial flooding in cities, roadways, farmland, subway tunnels and buildings 
(particularly those with basements) (Grahn and Nyberg, 2017; Palko, 2017; Pregnolato et al., 2017; Orr et 
al., 2018). Heavy precipitation may  overwhelm city transportation and storm water drainage systems, which 
are typically designed using intensity-duration-frequency information such as the return periods for 1-, 6- or 
24-hour rainfall totals (Kermanshah et al., 2017; Depietri and McPhearson, 2018; Rosenzweig et al., 2018; 
Courty et al., 2019). Heavy rain events can directly cause leaf loss and damage or knock over crops, also 
driving pollutant entrainment and erosion hazards in terrestrial ecosystems and farmland with downstream 
ramifications for water quality (Hatfield et al., 2014; Segura et al., 2014; Li and Fang, 2016; Chhetri et al., 
2019). The proportion of total precipitation that falls in heavy events also affects the percentage that is 
retained in the soil column, altering groundwater recharge and deep soil moisture content for agricultural use 
(Fishman, 2016; Lesk et al., 2020). 
 
 
### 12.3.2.4  Landslide 
 
Landslides, mudslides, rock falls, and other mass movements can lead to fatalities, destroy infrastructure and 
housing stock, and block critical transportation routes. Climate models cannot resolve these complex slope 
failure processes (nor triggering mechanisms such as earthquakes), so most studies rely on proxies or 
conditions conducive to slope failure (Gariano and Guzzetti, 2016; Ho et al., 2017). Common indices include 
precipitation intensity-duration thresholds (Brunetti et al., 2010; Khan et al., 2012; Melchiorre and Frattini, 
2012) and thresholds related to antecedent wet periods and extreme rainfall intensities (Alvioli et al., 2018; 
Monsieurs et al., 2019). Landslides and rockfalls may also be exacerbated by permafrost thaw and receding 
glaciers in polar and mountain areas (Cook et al., 2016; Haeberli et al., 2017a; Patton et al., 2019).  
  
 
### 12.3.2.5  Aridity 
 
Aridity indices may track long-term changes in precipitation, evapotranspiration demand, surface water, 
groundwater, or soil moisture (Sherwood and Fu, 2014; Herrera-Pantoja and Hiscock, 2015; Cook et al., 
2020a). Changes in soil moisture and surface water can shift the rate of carbon uptake by ecosystems 
(Humphrey et al., 2018) and alter suitable climate zones for wild species and agricultural cultivation (Feng 
and Fu, 2013; Garcia et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2016b; Schlaepfer et al., 2017; Fatemi et al., 2018; IPCC, 
2019c) as well as the prevalence of related pests and pathogen-carrying vectors (Paritsis and Veblen, 2011; 
Smith et al., 2020). Water table depth, in relation to rooting depth, is also important for farms and forests 
under dry conditions (Feng et al., 2006). A reduction in water availability (via aridity or hydrological 
drought) challenges water supplies needed for for municipal, industrial, agriculture and hydropower use 
(Schaeffer et al., 2012; Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes, 2014; Schewe et al., 2014b; Gosling and Arnell, 2016; van 
Vliet et al., 2016).   
 
 
### 12.3.2.6  Hydrological drought 
 
Water managers often utilize a variety of hydrological drought indices and hydrological models to 
characterize water resources, low flow conditions and the potential for irrigation (Wanders and Wada, 2015; 
Mukherjee et al., 2018) (11.9). Low flow volume and intermittency thresholds can indicate reductions in 
dissolved oxygen, more concentrated pollutants, and higher stream temperatures relevant for ecosystems, 
water resource quality, and thermal power plant cooling (Feeley et al., 2008; Döll and Schmied, 2012; 
Schaeffer et al., 2012; Prudhomme et al., 2014; van Vliet et al., 2016). Low water levels may also restrict 
waterway navigation for commerce and recreation (Forzieri et al., 2018).  
 
 
### 12.3.2.7  Agricultural and ecological drought 
 
Agricultural and ecological drought indices relate to the ability of plants to meet growth and transpiration 
needs (Zargar et al., 2011; Lobell et al., 2015; Pedro-Monzonís et al., 2015; Bachmair et al., 2016; Wehner et 
al., 2017; Naumann et al., 2018; Table 11.3) and the timing and duration of droughts can lead to substantially 
different impacts (Peña-Gallardo et al., 2019). Drought stress for agriculture and ecosystems is difficult to 
directly observe, and therefore, scientists use a variety of drought indices (Table 11.3), proxy information 
about changes in precipitation supply and reference evapotranspiration demand, the ratio of actual/potential 
evapotranspiration or a deficit in available soil water content, particularly at rooting level (Williams et al., 
2013; Trnka et al., 2014; Allen et al., 2015a; Svoboda and Fuchs, 2017; Mäkinen et al., 2018; Otkin et al., 
2018). Severe water stress can lead to crop failure, in particular when droughts persist for an extended period 
or occur during key plant developmental stages (Hatfield et al., 2014; Jolly et al., 2015; Leng and Hall, 
2019). Projections of high wind speed and low humidity (even for just a portion of the day) can also inform 
studies examining fruit desiccation and rice cracking (Grotjahn, 2021). Drought also raises disease infection 
rates for West Nile Virus (Paull et al., 2017), and the alternation of dry and wet spells induces swelling and 
shrinkage of clay soils that can lead to sinkholes and destabilize buildings (Hadji et al., 2014). 

### 12.3.2.8  Fire weather 
 
Complex fire weather indices shed light on conditions that increase the likelihood of wildfire and shifts in 
the fire season (Flannigan et al., 2013; Bedia et al., 2015; Jolly et al., 2015; Harvey, 2016; Littell et al., 2016; 
Westerling, 2016; Abatzoglou et al., 2019) which pose particularly acute challenges for indigenous 
communities (Christianson and McGee, 2019).  Projection of future lightning frequency provides 
information on an important natural triggering mechanism, particularly when coupled with long-term 
warming and drying trends (Romps et al., 2014; Jin et al., 2015; Veraverbeke et al., 2017). Fuel aridity 
metrics also help determine vegetative fuel desiccation and therefore the ignitability, flammability, and 
spread of fires when they occur (Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016). The presence of snow cover can influence 
the length of the fire season  and the penetration of fire danger into new portions of the Arctic tundra (Young 
et al., 2017; Abatzoglou et al., 2019). Data on the changing characteristics of local wind circulations like the 
Santa Ana in California shed light on future intensity and spread patterns for fires (Jin et al., 2015). Fires also 
produce smoke plumes that reduce air and water quality (via deposition), adversely affecting health, 
visibility and water resources both near and far downwind (Dennekamp and Abramson, 2011; McKenzie et 
al., 2014; Dreessen et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016; Martin, 2016).   
 
 
## 12.3.3  Wind 
 
### 12.3.3.1  Mean wind speed 
 
Changes in the speed and direction of prevailing winds can alter the profile of seed dispersal, windblown 
pest and disease vectors, animal activities, and dust or pollen dispersal affecting ecosystems, agriculture, and 
human health (Reid and Gamble, 2009; Bullock et al., 2012; Hellberg and Chu, 2016; Nourani et al., 2017).  
Seasonal winds influence algal blooms, ecosystems and fisheries via lake mixing, ocean currents and coastal 
upwelling (Bakun et al., 2015; Townhill et al., 2018; Woolway et al., 2020). Changes to wind density also 
modify a region’s wind and wave renewable energy endowment (Schaeffer et al., 2012; Sierra et al., 2017; 
Craig et al., 2018; Devis et al., 2018; Tobin et al., 2018; Yalew et al., 2020). Li et al. (2020) and Karnauskas 
et al. (2018) evaluated wind thresholds at turbine height (~80-100 m above ground) including periods outside 
of cut-in (2.5-3 m s-1) and cut-out (~25 m s-1) levels beyond which given turbines could not operate.   
 
 
### 12.3.3.2  Severe wind storm 
 
High winds associated with severe storms can level trees and houses, break plant stems and knock fruits, 
nuts and grains to the ground, with tolerance thresholds depending on crop species and developmental stage 
(Seidl et al., 2017; Lai, 2018; Elsner et al., 2019; Grotjahn, 2021).  Severe storms particularly threaten 
energy infrastructure, with maximum wind speed associated with treefall and breaking of above-ground 
electrical transmission lines (Ward, 2013; Nik et al., 2020) . The profile of heavy wind gusts is also required 
in the design of skyscrapers (Wang et al., 2013a) and bridges (Mondoro et al., 2018).  Severe storms are 
difficult to simulate at the relatively coarse spatial scales of earth system models, thus scientists often project 
changes by noting areas with increased convective available potential energy (CAPE) and strong low-level 
wind shear as these are conducive to tornado formation (Diffenbaugh et al., 2013; Tippett et al., 2016; Glazer 
et al., 2020). 

### 12.3.3.3  Tropical cyclone 
 
Tropical cyclones and severe coastal storms can deliver wind, water, and coastal hazards with the potential 
for widespread mortality and damages to cities, housing, transportation and energy infrastructure, 
ecosystems, and agricultural lands (Burkett, 2011; NASEM, 2012; Bell et al., 2013; Wehof et al., 2014; 
Ward et al., 2016; Cheal et al., 2017; Godoi et al., 2018; Koks et al., 2019; Pinnegar et al., 2019). Storm 
planning is often tied to the Saffir-Simpson scale related to peak sustained wind speed (Izaguirre et al., 
2021), with several indices focusing on storms’ overall power and energy, size and translation speed to 
anticipate destructive potential (Knutson et al., 2015; Wang and Toumi, 2016; Parker et al., 2018; 
Hassanzadeh et al., 2020).   
 
 
### 12.3.3.4  Sand and dust storm 
 
Sand and dust storms erode topsoils, damage crops and induce problems for health, transportation, 
mechanical equipment and built infrastructure corresponding to the magnitude and duration of high winds 
and particulate matter concentrations (Goudie, 2014; O’Loingsigh et al., 2014; Crooks et al., 2016; Barreau 
et al., 2017; Bhattachan et al., 2018; Al Ameri et al., 2019; Middleton et al., 2019). Dust events may be 
represented as the number of dust hours per dust storm year and by particulate matter (PM) concentrations 
(Leys et al., 2011; Spickett et al., 2011; Hand et al., 2016). Photovoltaic panels can lose energy production 
efficiency with dust accumulation (Patt et al., 2013; Javed et al., 2017). It is also useful to track dust storm 
deposition of nutrients necessary for coral and tropical forest systems, but they may also feed algal blooms 
harming lake and coastal ecosystems, health, and recreation (Jickells et al., 2005; Hallegraeff et al., 2014; 
Gabric et al., 2016). Dust storms also cause air pollution and redistribute the soil-based fungus associated 
with Valley Fever (Barreau et al., 2017; Coopersmith et al., 2017; Tong et al., 2017; Gorris et al., 2018).   
 
 
## 12.3.4  Snow and ice 

Cryospheric changes are a focus of Chapter 9 and were central to the recent IPCC Special Report on the 
Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (IPCC, 2019b). Here we focus on the ways that scientists use 
snow and ice CIDs to understand current and future societal impacts and risks.  
 
 
### 12.3.4.1  Snow, glacier and ice sheet 
 
A large number of indices have been used in water resource and ecosystem studies to track changes in snow 
under current and future climate conditions, including measurements of the snow water equivalent at key 
seasonal dates, the fraction of precipitation falling as snow, the first and last days of snow cover, and cold 
season temperatures (Mills et al., 2013; Pierce and Cayan, 2013; Berghuijs et al., 2014; Klos et al., 2014; 
Musselman et al., 2017; Rhoades et al., 2018). Applications also examine shifts in seasonal streamflow for 
snow-fed river basins (Mote et al., 2005; Pederson et al., 2011; Beniston and Stoffel, 2014; Coppola et al., 
2014, Fyfe et al., 2017; Coppola et al., 2018; Islam et al., 2017; Knouft and Ficklin, 2017) as well as the 
geographic extent of snow cover and the depth of frosts when snow cover’s natural insulation is absent 
(Scheurer et al., 2009; Millar and Stephenson, 2015). Studies examining the impact of snow changes on 
winter recreation and transportation have used thresholds of ~30 cm snow depth or snow water equivalent > 
10 cm to determine the length of the season for alpine and cross-country skiing and snowmobiling (Damm et 
al., 2017; Wobus et al., 2017b; Spandre et al., 2019; Steiger et al., 2019; Abegg et al., 2020). Changes in 
snow quality also affect recreational activities (Rutty et al., 2017), and artificial snowmaking can augment 
recreational snowpack depending on the number of suitable snowmaking hours (e.g., where WBGT <  -2.2 
°C; Wobus et al., 2017). Local detail may also be provided by tracking the seasonal rain-snow transition line 
across space and elevation (Berghuijs et al., 2014).   
 
Change in ice sheet and glacier spatial extent and surface mass balance is relevant for polar and high 
mountain ecosystems and downstream assets that rely on glacial water resources (Lee et al., 2017a; Milner et 
al., 2017; Huss and Hock, 2018; Schaefli et al., 2019). The loss of glaciers reduces the thermal consistency 
of cold streams suitable for some freshwater species (Giersch et al., 2017), and parks and recreation areas 
may lose appeal as glaciers and seasonal snow cover retreat (Gonzalez et al., 2018; Wang and Zhou, 2019). 
Rapid glacial retreat can lead to glacial lakes and outburst floods that endanger downstream communities 
(Carrivick and Tweed, 2016; Cook et al., 2016; Harrison et al., 2018). 


### 12.3.4.2  Permafrost  
 
Changes in permafrost temperature, extent, and active layer thickness are metrics that track how permafrost 
thaw below for e.g. roads, airstrips, rails, and building foundations in high-latitude and mountain regions 
may destabilize settlements and critical infrastructure (Pendakur, 2016; Derksen et al., 2018; Duvillard et al., 
2019; Olsson et al., 2019; Streletskiy et al., 2019).  Warmer conditions can also affect ecosystems, built 
infrastructure, and water resources through thawing of especially ice-rich permafrost (≥ 20% ice content) and 
by thawing of ice wedges (Shiklomanov et al., 2017; Hjort et al., 2018), creation of thermokarst ponds and 
increased subsurface drainage for polar and high-mountain wetlands (Walvoord and Kurylyk, 2016; 
Farquharson et al., 2019) and the release of water pollutants such as mercury (Burkett, 2011; Schaeffer et al., 
2012; Schuster et al., 2018) .  
 
 
### 12.3.4.3  Lake, river and sea ice 
 
Reductions in the duration of thick sea, lake and river ice influence ecosystems as well as ice fishing, 
hunting, dog sledding, and snowmobiling; which are recreation activities for some but vital aspects of many 
traditional indigenous communities (Durkalec et al., 2015; AMAP, 2017a; Baztan et al., 2017; Arp et al., 
2018; Rokaya et al., 2018; Knoll et al., 2019; Meredith et al., 2019; Sharma et al., 2019). The seasonal extent 
of thin ice and iceberg density also determines the viability of shipping lanes and seasonal roads (Valsson 
and Ulfarsson, 2011; Pizzolato et al., 2016; AMAP, 2017; Mullan et al., 2017; Sturm et al., 2017), oil and 
gas exploration timing (Schaeffer et al., 2012) and the seasonality of phytoplankton blooms (Oziel et al., 
2017). Sea ice is a critical aspect of some ecosystems and fisheries (Massom and Stammerjohn, 2010; 
Jenouvrier et al., 2014; Bindoff et al., 2019; Meredith et al., 2019). Various definitions of ‘ice free’ Arctic 
Ocean conditions can be tailored to represent transportation needs, including thresholds of ice coverage (< 
5% or < 30% or < 1 million km2) in September or over a 4-month period (Laliberté et al., 2016; Jahn, 2018).   
 
 
### 12.3.4.4  Heavy snowfall and ice storm 
 
Heavy snowfall is a substantial concern for cities, settlements, and key transportation and energy 
infrastructure (Ward, 2013; Palko, 2017; Janoski et al., 2018; Collins et al., 2019). Heavy snowfall can 
interfere with transportation (Herring et al., 2018) and cause a loss of both work and school days depending 
on local snow removal infrastructure. Freezing rain and ice storms can be treacherous for road and air travel 
(Tamerius et al., 2016), and can knock down power and telecommunication lines if ice accumulation is high 
(Degelia et al., 2016). Rain-on-snow events can create a solid barrier that hinders wildlife and livestock 
grazing that is important to indigenous communities (Forbes et al., 2016). Shifts in the frequency, seasonal 
timing and regions susceptible to ice storms shift risks for agriculture and infrastructure (Lambert and 
Hansen, 2011; Klima and Morgan, 2015; Ning and Bradley, 2015; Groisman et al., 2016). 
 
 
### 12.3.4.5  Hail 
 
Information on the changing frequency and size distribution of hail can help stakeholders build resilience for 
agriculture, vehicles, transportation infrastructure and buildings, solar panels, and wild species that see 
critical damage at particular hail size thresholds (Dessens et al., 2007; Webb et al., 2009; Patt et al., 2013; 
Fiss et al., 2019). Most climate models do not directly resolve hail and therefore studies often examine 
proxies associated with severe mesoscale storms (Tippett et al., 2015; Prein and Holland, 2018) although 
some regional studies now utilize hail-resolving models (Mahoney et al., 2012; Brimelow et al., 2017).  
 
 
### 12.3.4.6  Snow avalanche 
 
Information about the changing frequency and seasonal timing of snow avalanches is important to assess 
threats to transportation routes, infrastructure, recreational skiing, and people living in alpine communities 
(Lazar and Williams, 2008; Mock et al., 2017; Ballesteros-Cánovas et al., 2018; Hock et al., 2019). Like 
landslides and other mass movements, snow avalanches are not directly resolved by climate models and are 
thus tracked using proxy climate information describing snow avalanche susceptibility, particularly the snow 
water equivalent, and triggering mechanisms such as heatwaves, high winds, rain-on-snow and heavy 
precipitation (Hock et al., 2019). The quality of snow also provides insight into avalanche hazards (Mock et 
al., 2017), with the seasonal altitude of wet snowpack (>0 .5% liquid water by volume) particularly 
important in determining characteristics of potential avalanches (Castebrunet et al., 2014).   
 
 
## 12.3.5  Coastal 

The recent IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate included in-depth 
discussions of threats facing the world’s coastlines (IPCC, 2019b) and Section 9.6 provides further 
discussion on coastal processes. Here we note major connections between coastal CIDs and ecosystem and 
societal assets near coastlines.   
 
 
### 12.3.5.1  Relative sea level  
 
Sea level rise hazards for coastal ecosystems, infrastructure, farmland, cities and settlements in a particular 
region are often driven by regional changes in relative sea level (RSL) that accounts for land uplift or 
subsidence and thus represents local asset vulnerability better than global mean sea level (Hallegatte et al., 
2013; Hinkel et al., 2013; McInnes et al., 2016; Weatherdon et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2018; IPCC, 2019b; 
Rasoulkhani et al., 2020) (Box 9.1). Vertical land motion (i.e. land subsidence) caused by local fluid (gas or 
groundwater) extraction can also have a large influence on relative sea levels (Minderhoud et al., 2020). 
Several indices have been suggested to signify coastal inundation, including a threshold when the local land 
elevation falls below the local mean higher-high water (MHHW) that is close to the ‘high tide’ level (Kulp 
and Strauss, 2019) or a threshold when flooding occurs about once every two weeks (Sweet and Park, 2014; 
Dahl et al., 2017b). RSL rise (or RSLR) can drive increased inland penetration of above-ground and 
subterranean salt water fronts (i.e., salinity intrusion) affecting coastal ecosystems, agriculture, and water 
resources (Ferguson and Gleeson, 2012; Kirwan and Megonigal, 2013; Rotzoll and Fletcher, 2013; Chen et 
al., 2016; Colombani et al., 2016; Holding et al., 2016; Sawyer et al., 2016; Mohammed and Scholz, 2018). 
The rate of RSLR can determine the survival and net pressure on niche coastal ecosystems such as 
mangroves, tidal flats, sea grasses and coral reefs (Hubbard et al., 2008; Craft et al., 2009; Bell et al., 2013; 
Kirwan and Megonigal, 2013; Alongi, 2015; Ellison, 2015; Lovelock et al., 2015; Ward et al., 2016; Lee et 
al., 2018).  
 
 
### 12.3.5.2  Coastal flood 
 
Episodic coastal flooding of coastal communities, farmland, buildings, transportation routes, industry and 
other infrastructure is caused by Extreme Total Water Levels (ETWL), which is the combination of RSL, 
tides, storm surge and high wave setup at the shoreline (Vitousek et al., 2017; Melet et al., 2018; 
Vousdoukas et al., 2018, 2020a; Koks et al., 2019; Kirezci et al., 2020). Coastal settlement and infrastructure 
design often uses coastal flooding metrics such as the ETWL frequency distribution or the 100-year average 
return interval storm tide (storm surge + high tide) level (McInnes et al., 2016; Mills et al., 2016; Walsh et 
al., 2016b; Zheng et al., 2017). The duration of floods that overtop coastal protection, due to Extreme 
Coastal Water Levels (ECWL) is important for port and harbour operations and coastal energy infrastructure 
thresholds (Bilskie et al., 2016; Camus et al., 2017). Frequent inundation by salt water can also have 
significant impacts on water resources, crops, aquaculture and transportation systems due to corrosion and 
undercutting of coastal roads, bridges, and rails (Zimmerman and Faris, 2010; Ahmed et al., 2019b; 
Gopalakrishnan et al., 2019).   
 
 
### 12.3.5.3  Coastal erosion 

Effective management of coastal ecosystems, cities, settlements, beaches and infrastructure requires 
information about coastal erosion driven by storm surge, waves, and sea level rise (Dawson et al., 2009; 
Harley et al., 2017; Mentaschi et al., 2017 Hinkel et al., 2013). Coastal erosion is generally accompanied by 
shoreline retreat, which can occur as a gradual process (e.g., due to sea level rise) or as an episodic event due 
to storm surge and/or extreme waves, especially when combined with high tide (Ranasinghe, 2016). The 
most commonly used shoreline retreat index is the magnitude of shoreline retreat by a pre-determined 
planning horizon such as 50 or 100 years into the future. Commonly used metrics for episodic coastal 
erosion include the beach erosion volume due to the 100 yr recurrence storm wave height, the full 
exceedance probability distribution of coastal erosion volume (Li et al., 2014; Pender et al., 2015; 
Ranasinghe and Callaghan, 2017) and the cumulative storm energy and storm power index (Godoi et al., 
2018). The destruction or overtopping of barrier islands may lead to irreversible changes in the physical 
system as well as in coastal ecosystems (Carrasco et al., 2016; Zinnert et al., 2019). Shoreline position 
change rates along inlet-interrupted coasts may also be affected by changes in river flows and fluvial 
sediment supply (Hinkel et al., 2013; Bamunawala et al., 2018; Ranasinghe et al., 2019). Permafrost thaw 
and Arctic sea ice decline also reduce natural coastal protection from wave erosion for communities and 
industry (Forbes, 2011; Melvin et al., 2017).   
 
 
## 12.3.6  Oceanic 

Oceanic changes and impacts were a substantial focus of the recent IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and 
Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (IPCC, 2019b). Chapter 9 assesses changes in ocean processes, and here 
we note major connections used by scientists to understand how oceanic CIDs affect ecosystems and society.   
 
 
### 12.3.6.1  Mean ocean temperature 
 
Shifts in thermal zones affect the suitability of fisheries and marine and coastal species habitat and migration 
routes (Hoegh-Guldberg and Bruno, 2010; Doney et al., 2012; Burrows et al., 2014; Urban, 2015; Hixson 
and Arts, 2016; Tripathi et al., 2016; Ahmed et al., 2019b; Bindoff et al., 2019). Intertidal species are 
particularly dependent on suitable conditions for both air and sea surface temperatures (Monaco and 
McQuaid, 2019). The structure of ocean warming also affects the intensity of upper-ocean stratification and 
the timing and strength of coastal upwelling (driven also by mean wind changes), which alters the vertical 
transport of oxygen- and nutrient-rich waters affecting fishery and marine ecosystem productivity (Wang et 
al., 2015).  
 
 
### 12.3.6.2  Marine heatwave 
 
Marine heatwaves (MHW) push water temperatures above key thresholds and have been associated with 
coral bleaching episodes, species shifts, and harmful algal blooms that can disrupt ecosystems, tourism and 
human health (see Box 9.2; Wernberg et al., 2016; Arias-Ortiz et al., 2018; Oliver et al., 2018; Frölicher, 
2019; Smale et al., 2019; Sully et al., 2019). The duration and return period of marine heatwaves provide 
insight into aggregate stresses on marine species, fisheries and ecosystems, with various indices gauging 
cumulative intensity or the number of days, weeks or months exceeding critical thresholds (Frieler et al., 
2013; Frölicher et al., 2018; Hughes et al., 2018b; Cheung and Frölicher, 2020). Hobday et al. (2016) defined 
marine heatwaves as the exceedance of the 30-year 90th percentile of the sea surface temperature (SST) 
distribution on a given Julian day during 5 or more consecutive days, while Box 9.2, Figure 1 shows MHW 
as an exceedance of 99th-percentile 11-day de-seasonalised SSTs. The return period of marine heatwaves is 
also critical in determining a coral system’s ability to recover before the next event (Hughes et al., 2018a).  
 
 
### 12.3.6.3  Ocean acidity 
 
Uptake of atmospheric CO2 and subsequent increases in dissolved CO2 lowers ocean pH and can reduce 
carbonate ion concentrations below critical calcium carbonate saturation thresholds for marine and aquatic 
organisms growth, reproduction and/or survival with extended implications for marine ecosystems including 
fisheries (Bell et al., 2013; Kroeker et al., 2013; Barange et al., 2014; Mathis et al., 2015a; Nagelkerken and 
Connell, 2015; Dutkiewicz et al., 2015; Ekstrom et al., 2015; Gattuso et al., 2015; Nagelkerken and Munday, 
2016; Tripathi et al., 2016; Behrenfeld et al., 2016b; Weiss et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2018; Ahmed et al., 
2019b; Bindoff et al., 2019). Lower pH may provide more favourable conditions for toxic algal blooms 
(Riebesell et al., 2018) and can interact with hypoxic zones to impact ecosystems (Gobler and Baumann, 
2016; Cai et al., 2017). 
 
 
### 12.3.6.4  Ocean Salinity 
 
Changes in currents, sea ice brine rejection and net freshwater flux in the ocean can alter salinity with effects 
on mixed layer structure, density stratification, and the vertical movement of nutrients and marine organisms 
(Freeland, 2013; Haumann et al., 2016).  
 
 
### 12.3.6.5  Dissolved oxygen 
 
Ocean warming and increased stratification decrease the oxygen content of the ocean (Griffiths et al., 2017; 
Schmidtko et al., 2017; Bindoff et al., 2019), lead to an expansion of oxygen minimum zones in the open 
ocean (Stramma et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013) and exacerbate the creation of anoxic “dead zones” in the 
coastal oceans (Breitburg et al., 2018). Such a decline (characterized by successive dissolved oxygen 
concentration thresholds) could affect a wide range of marine organisms and reduce marine habitats (Chan et 
al., 2008; Vaquer-Sunyer and Duarte, 2008; Hoegh-Guldberg and Bruno, 2010; Altieri and Gedan, 2015; 
Breitburg et al., 2018) and can also lead to further local acidification (Zhang and Gao, 2016; Laurent et al., 
2017). 
 
 
## 12.3.7  Other climatic impact-drivers 
 
### 12.3.7.1  Air pollution weather 
 
Although future air pollution will be strongly driven by air quality policies, anthropogenically-driven 
changes to temperature, humidity, precipitation, and synoptic patterns have the potential to affect the 
emissions, production, concentration and transport of particulate matter (e.g., from dust, fires, pollen), and  
gaseous pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, tropospheric ozone, and nitrogen dioxide (see Section 6.5) with 
resulting impacts on human health, agriculture and ecosystems (Ren et al., 2011; Fiore et al., 2015; Kinney et 
al., 2015a; Tian et al., 2016; Orru et al., 2017; Emberson et al., 2018; Hayes et al., 2020). Information about 
conditions leading to poor air quality is also important for visibility in natural parks and tourist locations 
(Yue et al., 2013; Val Martin et al., 2015), as well as the efficiency of solar photovoltaic panels (Sweerts et 
al., 2019). Relevant information about conditions favouring air pollution includes tracking warmer 
conditions that accelerate ozone formation (Peel et al., 2013; Schnell et al., 2016) and the frequency and 
duration of stagnant air events (Horton et al., 2014; Fann et al., 2015; Lelieveld et al., 2015; Vautard et al., 
2018), although no regional index has proven sufficient to capture regional changes or acute events (Kerr 
and Waugh, 2018; Schnell et al., 2018) whereas precipitation and moister air tend to reduce pollution 
(Section 6.5).  
 
 
### 12.3.7.2  Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide (CO2) at surface 
 
CO2 is a well-mixed greenhouse gas with global repercussions on the Earth’s energy balance; however, 
atmospheric CO2 concentration changes at the land surface also affect plant functions within ecosystems and 
agriculture (see also Chapter 5). High CO2 concentration can increase photosynthesis rates and primary 
production within natural ecosystems (Norby et al., 2010; Ratliff et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2016) and 
agricultural crops (Hatfield et al., 2011; Leakey et al., 2012; Bell et al., 2013; Glenn et al., 2014; 
Nagelkerken and Connell, 2015; Behrenfeld et al., 2016a; Deryng et al., 2016; Kimball, 2016). High CO2 
concentration affects total biomass and plant sugar content important to bioenergy production (Schaeffer et 
al., 2012), but also helps some pests and weeds flourish (Hamilton et al., 2005; Wolfe et al., 2008; Valerio et 
al., 2013; Korres et al., 2016; Stinson et al., 2016; Ramesh et al., 2017) while potentially shifting the 
effectiveness of herbicides (Varanasi et al., 2016; Refatti et al., 2019). Higher CO2 concentration reduces 
transpiration losses during drought conditions (Cammarano et al., 2016; Deryng et al., 2016; Swann et al., 
2016; Durand et al., 2018), which also changes the energy balance within the plant canopy (Webber et al., 
2017). Higher CO2 reduces the nutritional density of crops and forage lands (Loladze, 2014; Müller et al., 
2014; Myers et al., 2014, 2017; Li et al., 2016c; Lee et al., 2017b; Smith and Myers, 2018; Zhu et al., 2018; 
Beach et al., 2019) and can increase the production of toxins (Ziska et al., 2007) and allergenic pollen 
(Schmidt, 2016).  
 
 
### 12.3.7.3  Radiation at surface 
 
Changes in surface solar and longwave radiation fluxes alter photosynthesis rates and potential 
evapotranspiration for natural ecosystems and food, fibre, and energy crops (Mäkinen et al., 2018) and shift 
solar energy resources (Schaeffer et al., 2012; Jerez et al., 2015; Wild et al., 2015; Fant et al., 2016; Craig et 
al., 2018).  Plants and aquatic systems particularly respond to changes in photosynthetically-active radiation 
(PAR) and the fraction of diffuse radiation (Proctor et al., 2018; Ren et al., 2018; Ryu et al., 2018). Increases 
in ultraviolet radiation can also detrimentally affect ecosystems and human health (Barnes et al., 2019).   
 
 
### 12.3.7.4  Additional relevant climatic impact-drivers 
 
Additional CIDs may be relevant for regional studies but are not the focus of assessment in this report.  For 
example, information about changes in the frequency and seasonal timing of fog helps anticipate airport 
delays and cool beach days, and is also important for water delivery and retention in coastal ecological and 
agricultural systems (Torregrosa et al., 2014).   
 
Threats to many sectoral assets and associated systems may also be compounded when multiple hazards 
occur simultaneously in the same place, affect multiple regions at the same time, or occur in a sequence that 
may amplify overall impact (see Section 11.8; Clarke et al., 2018; IPCC, 2012a; Raymond et al., 2020; 
Zscheischler et al., 2018). There is emerging literature on many connected extremes and their associated 
hazards (e.g., climatic conditions that could drive multi-breadbasket failures; Kornhuber et al., 2019; Trnka 
et al., 2019), but a full accounting is not practical here especially considering the many possible CID 
combinations and the need to assess how exposed systems would be vulnerable to compound CIDs (assessed 
in Working Group II).  Table 12.2 is once again instructive here in considering hazard-related storylines, as 
the multiple CIDs affecting a given sectoral asset (assessing across a row of Table 12.2) point to potentially 
dangerous hazard combinations. Similarly, change in a single CID has the potential to affect multiple 
sectoral assets (assessing down a column of Table 12.2) in a manner with broader systemic implications (see 
AR6 WGII).   
 
*Recent literature defines CID indices to represent trends and thresholds that influence sectoral assets, 
albeit with considerable variation owing to the unique characteristics of regional and sectoral assets. 
Indices include direct information about the CID’s profile (magnitude, frequency, duration, timing, 
spatial extent) or utilize atmospheric conditions as a proxy for CIDs that are more difficult to directly 
observe or simulate. Each sector is affected by multiple CIDs, and each CID affects multiple sectors.  
Assets within the same sector may require different or tailored indices even for the same CID. These 
indices may be defined to capture graduated thresholds associated with tipping points or inflection 
points in a particular sectoral vulnerability, with commonalities in the types of processes these 
thresholds represent even as their precise magnitude may vary by specific sectoral system and asset.*     


# <goto>12.4</goto>  Regional information on changing climate 
 
This section describes the historical and projected changes in commonly used indices and thresholds 
associated with the main climatic impact-drivers (see 12.2 and 12.3) at the scale of AR6 regions described in 
(Figure 1.18a). The section is organised by continents (12.4.1-12.4.6) with a specific assessment for small 
islands (12.4.7), open and deep ocean (12.4.8), and Polar regions (12.4.9) as defined in Chapter 1 (Figure 
1.18c). In addition, CID indices and thresholds relevant to and Specific zones, as defined in WGII AR6 
“Cross-Chapter Papers”, are assessed in Section 12.4.10 except for the Mediterranean, which is addressed 
both under Africa and Europe (12.4.1 and 12.4.5) and is a focus in 10.6.4. 
 
Regional assessment method and tables: In each section herein (12.4.1 – 12.4.10), we assess changes in 
sector-relevant CIDs following the main CID categories defined in Section 12.2 through commonly used 
indices and thresholds relevant for sectors described in 12.3. Sections 12.4.1-12.4.9 each include a summary 
qualitative CID assessment table (Tables 12.3-12.11) showing the confidence levels associated with the 
direction of projected CID changes (i,e increasing or decreasing) for the mid-century period (2041-2060) 
relative to the recent past, for scenarios RCP4.5, SSP2-4.5, SRES A1B, or above (RCP6.0, RCP8.5, SSP3-
7.0, SSP5-8.5, SRES A2), which approximately encompasses Global Warming Levels of 2.0°C to 2.4°C (as 
best estimate, see Chapter 4, Table 4.5). For Scenarios RCP2.6, SSP1-2.6 or SSP1-1.9, the signal may have 
lower confidence levels in some cases due to smaller overall changes, embedded in a similar internal 
variability, and to the availability of relatively few studies that account for these scenarios. Nevertheless, 
CID changes under these lower emissions scenarios are included in the text whenever information is 
available. For each cell in Tables 12.3-12.11, literature is assessed, aided by global Figure 12.4 or regional 
Figures 12.5-12.10. Confidence in projections is established considering evidence emerging from 
observations, attribution and projections, as explained in CCBox 10.3 while considering the amount of 
evidence and agreement across models and studies and model generations. 
 
The confidence levels associated with the directions of projected CID changes are synthesized assessments 
based on literature that may utilize different indices and baseline periods or projections by global warming 
levels. For extreme heat, cold spell, heavy precipitation and drought CIDs that are assessed in Chapter 11, 
here we draw projections from the 2°C global warming level tables in Section 11.9. In some cases, more 
details are needed in order to emphasize one aspect of projected CID change. For instance, the change in a 
CID may be different for intensity, duration, frequency; or there can be strong sub-regional or seasonal 
signals; or different CID indices may have conflicting signals. A footnote is added in such cases, but a 
confidence level for a direction of projected change is given based on the 12.3 assessment of aspects of 
regional CID change that are most relevant for impacts and for risks. As an example, tropical cyclones are 
increasing in intensity but decreasing in frequency in some regions. Here, in assessing the confidence of the 
direction of projected change in the Tropical cyclone CID (i.e. the colour of the table cell), we assign more 
weight to the “intensity” rather than the “frequency”, corresponding to the higher relevance of the intensity 
major tropical cyclones for risk assessment. Low confidence of changes, arising from lack of evidence, 
strong spatial or seasonal heterogeneity, or lack of agreement are represented by colour-less cells, and, for 
the sake of simplicity, only two categories of confidence are given: “medium confidence” and “high 
confidence” (and higher). In addition, CID assessment tables also indicate observed or projected emergence 
of the CID change signal from the natural inter-annual variability if assessed with at least medium 
confidence in Section 12.5.2, using as a basis a criterion of S/N > 1, noise being defined as the interannual 
variability. The time of emergence (ToE) is given as either: (i) already emerged in the historical period, or 
(ii) emerging by 2050 at least for RCP8.5/SSP5-8.5, or (iii) emerging after 2050 but before 2100 at least for 
scenarios RCP8.5 or SSP5-8.5. Table cells that do not include emergence information are indicative of “low 
confidence of emergence in the 21st century”, which includes situations where assessment indicates 
emergence will not occur before 2100 or that evidence is not available or insufficient for a confidence 
assessment of time of emergence. 
 
Figures: The assessment of changes in CIDs is based on literature, physical understanding (Chapters 2-11), 
and global and regional climate projections of indices and thresholds presented in the Atlas, as well as in the 
global and regional figures in 12.4 (Figures 12.4-12.10) showing the future evolution of 9 key CID 
indices/thresholds used in this assessment (see also Cross-Chapter Box 10.3). The figure indices and 
impacts-relevant thresholds are described in the Technical Annex VI on Climatic impact-drivers and 
Extreme Indices.  
 
Figure 12.4 shows changes in 6 CID indices.  These global maps are derived from CMIP6 simulations for 
different time periods and scenarios (except for Extreme Total Water Level where CMIP5 is used). The 
uncertainty due to climate models, time, scenarios and regional downscaling is illustrated in Supplementary 
Figures SM.12.1 to SM.12.6 which show the distribution of the spatial average of the index among models 
over each land region for CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX ensembles for the recent past, mid- and end-21st 
century, and for GWLs +1.5ºC, +2ºC and +4ºC. The hatching in the figure covers areas where less than 80% 
of models agree on the sign of change.

Further regional detail is provided for the remaining indices in each continental section in the form of 
continental maps accompanied by regional box plots displaying changes calculated for AR6 region averages, 
and the associated regionally averaged uncertainty. 
 
*Climatic impact-drivers changing in a globally coherent way:* For the sake of conciseness, assessments 
pertaining to ocean acidity and the ‘Other’ CID type in 12.2 and 12.3 are not provided per region in Sections 
12.4.1-9 but are summarised here given the globally coherent way in which they change. 
 
*Ocean acidity:* Observations show increasing ocean acidification (robust evidence, high agreement), and it 
is virtually certain that future ocean acidification will increase given future increases in greenhouse gases 
(5.4). Areas below calcium carbonate saturation thresholds expanded from the 1990s-2010 and Meredith et 
al. (2019) indicated that both the Southern and Arctic Oceans will experience year-round under-saturation 
conditions by 2100 under RCP8.5.  The vertical level of the aragonite saturation horizon off the Pacific coast 
of North America has risen toward the surface by 30-50 m since pre-industrial times (Mathis et al., 2015b; 
Feely et al., 2016). In a study of US coastlines, Ekstrom et al. (2015) mapped out the projected year when 
aragonite saturation state drops below 1.5 (a sublethal threshold for bivalve mollusk larvae), finding 
hazardous conditions before 2030 from northern Oregon to Alaska and before 2100 for the Pacific coast and 
Atlantic coastline north of New Jersey.  Mathis et al. (2015a) found that surface waters in the Beaufort Sea 
have already dropped below aragonite saturation thresholds, projecting further declines and the Chukchi Sea 
also dropping below saturation by ~2030. 
 
*Air pollution weather:* The effect of climate change on air quality is assessed in Section 6.5 with limitations 
for local planning explained in 6.1.3, and only a brief summary is given here. Section 6.5 notes that climate 
change will have a small burden on particulate matter (PM) pollution (medium confidence) while the main 
controlling factor in determining future concentrations will be future emissions policy for PM and their 
precursors (high confidence). Surface ozone is sensitive to temperature and water vapor changes, but future 
levels depend on precursor emissions. Although there is low confidence in precise regional changes (Section 
6.5), climate change will generally introduce a surface O3 penalty (increasing concentrations with increasing 
warming levels) over regions with high anthropogenic and/or natural ozone precursor emissions, while in 
less polluted regions higher temperatures and humidity favor destruction of ozone (Schnell et al., 2016). 
There is low confidence in changes to future stagnation events given the lack of robust projections of related 
atmospheric conditions, such as future atmospheric blocking events (Sections 3.3.3, 8.4.2).  The response of 
regional air pollution to climate change will also be affected by other CIDs like fire weather, as well as by 
ecosystem responses such as shifts in emissions by vegetation (Fiore et al., 2015). Section 6.5 assessed 
medium confidence that climate driven changes to meteorological conditions generally favor extreme air 
pollution episodes in heavily polluted environments, but noted strong regional and metric dependencies. 
Given the dominant influence of future air quality policies, uncertainties around stagnation or blocking 
events, and the potential contrasting regional changes of conditions favoring ozone and PM formation, 
accumulation and destruction, cells in Tables 12.3-12.11 for air pollution weather are marked as low 
confidence, and the reader is referred to Section 6.5 for further details. 
 
*Atmospheric CO2 at surface:*  Observations show rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations at the surface over 
all earth regions (robust evidence, high agreement) (Sections 2.2, 5.1.1), and it is virtually certain that 
surface atmospheric CO2 concentrations will continue to increase absent substantial changes to emissions 
(Section 5.4).  
 
*Radiation at surface:* Radiation has undergone decadal variations in past observations which are mostly 
responding to the so-called dimming and brightening phenomenon driven by the increase and decrease of 
aerosols. Over the last two decades or so, brightening continues in Europe and Northern America and 
dimming stabilizes over South and East Asia and increases in some other areas (7.2.2.3). Future regional 
shortwave radiation projections depend mostly on cloud trends, aerosol and water vapour trends, and 
stratospheric ozone when considering UV radiation. Over Africa in 2050 and beyond, there is medium 
confidence that radiation will increase in North and South Africa and decrease over the Sahara, North-East 
Africa and West Africa (Wild et al., 2015, 2017; Soares et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2019b; Sawadogo et al., 
2020a, 2020b). Over Asia, the CMIP5 multi-model-mean response shows that solar radiation will decrease in 
South Asia and increase in East Asia (medium confidence) by the mid-century RCP8.5 (Wild et al., 2015, 
2017; Ruosteenoja et al., 2019a). Projected solar resources show an increasing trend throughout the 21st 
century in east Asia under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios in CMIP5 simulations (Wild et al., 2015; Zhang et 
al., 2018a; Shiogama et al., 2020) (medium confidence). More sunshine is projected over Australia in winter 
and spring by the end of the century (medium confidence) with the increases in southern Australia exceeding 
10% (CSIRO and BOM, 2015; Wild et al., 2015). In Central and South America, there is medium confidence 
of increasing solar radiation over the Amazon Basin and the Northern part of South America (Wild et al., 
2015, 2017; de Jong et al., 2019) (medium confidence). There is low confidence for an increase in surface 
radiation in Central Europe, owing in particular to disagreement in cloud cover across global and regional 
models (Jerez et al., 2015; Bartók et al., 2017; Craig et al., 2018), as well as water vapor. The treatment of 
aerosol appears to be key in explaining these differences (Boé, 2016; Undorf et al., 2018; Boé et al., 2020; 
Gutiérrez et al., 2020). Regional and global studies however indicate that there is medium confidence in 
increasing radiation over Southern Europe and decreasing radiation over Northern Europe. Increasing 
radiation trends are also found over Southern and Eastern U.S.A., and decreasing trends over North Western 
North America (Wild et al., 2015; Losada Carreño et al., 2020), despite large differences between responses 
from RCMs and GCMs over South and Eastern U.S.A. (low confidence), where, as for central Europe, the 
role of aerosols appears important (Chen, 2021). Over polar regions there is medium confidence of a decrease 
in radiation due to increasing moisture in the atmosphere and clouds (Wild et al., 2015). 

## 12.4.1  Africa 
 
Previous IPCC assessments results are summarized in the Atlas section 4.1.1 For the purpose of this 
assessment the Africa region has been divided in 9 sub regions of which 8 Sahara (SAH), Western Africa 
(WAF), Central Africa (CAF), North East Africa (NEAF), South East Africa (SEAF), West Southern Africa 
(WSAF), East Southern Africa (ESAF) and Madagascar (MDG) are the official AR6 regions (see Figure 
Atlas.2) and one North Africa is used in this assessment to indicate the African portion of the Mediterranean 
region.  
 
Quite a large body of new literature is now available for the African climate as a result of regionally 
downscaled CORDEX Africa outputs, in particular, providing projections of both the mean climate (Mariotti 
et al., 2014; Nikulin et al., 2018; Dosio et al., 2019; Teichmann et al., 2020) and extreme climate phenomena 
(Giorgi et al., 2014; Nikulin et al., 2018; Dosio et al., 2019; Coppola et al., 2021b). CORDEX Africa 
simulations are assessed in the Atlas, which finds reasonable skill in mean temperature and precipitation as 
well as important features of regional climate (e.g., timing of monsoon onset in West Africa) although lower 
performance in Central Africa.  
 
<figref>12.5</figref> 
 
### 12.4.1.1  Heat and cold 
 
*Mean air temperature*: The African continent has experienced increased warming since the beginning of 
the 20th century in regions where measurements allow a sufficient homogeneous observation coverage to 
estimate trends (high confidence) (Figure Atlas.11). This warming is very likely attributable to human 
influence (Chapter 3, Atlas.4.2) at continental scale. Mean annual temperature have increased in recent 
decades at a high rate since the mid-20th century, reaching 0.2-0.5°C/decade in some regions such as 
north, north-eastern, west and south-western Africa (high confidence) (Atlas.4.2, Figure Atlas.11).  
 
It is very likely that temperatures will increase in all future emission scenarios and all regions of Africa 
(Atlas.4.4). By the end of century under RCP8.5 or SSP5-8.5, all African regions will very likely experience 
a warming larger than 3°C except Central Africa where warming is very likely expected above 2.5°C under, 
while under RCP2.6 or SSP1-2.6, the warming remains very likely limited to below 2°C (Figure Atlas.19). A 
very likely warming with ranges between 0.5°C and 2.5°C is projected by the mid-century for all scenarios 
depending on the region (high confidence). Mean temperature for all regions are projected to increase with 
increasing global warming (virtually certain) (Figure Atlas.19).   
 
*Extreme heat:* Warm extremes have increased in most of the regions (high confidence), NEAF and MDG 
(medium confidence) and with low confidence in CAF and SEAF (Chapter 11, Table 11.4). Despite the 
increasing mean temperature, there is low confidence (limited evidence) that Africa has experienced 
increased extreme heat stress trend for agriculture or human health in the last two decades of the 20th 
century in a few regions such as West Africa, South Africa and North Africa considering the period from 
1973 to 2012 (Knutson and Ploshay, 2016).  
 
A substantial increase in heatwave magnitude and frequency over most of the Africa domain is projected for 
even 2℃ global warming (high confidence) (Chapter 11, 11.3,11.9, Table 11.4,), with potential effects on 
health and agriculture. The number of days with maximum temperature exceeding 35°C is projected to  
increase (Coppola et al., 2021b) in the range of 50-100 days by 2050 under SSP5-8.5 in WAF, ESAF and 
WSAF and NEAF (high confidence) (Figure 12.4b). Under SSP1-2.6, the change in the number of 
exceedance days remains limited to about 40-50 days per year at the end of the Century, at the end of the 
century in these regions, while it increases by 150 days or more in WAF, CAF, NEAF for SSP5-8.5  
(Figure 12.4a,c). 
 
Mortality-related heat stress levels and deadly temperatures are very likely to become more frequent in the 
future in RCP8.5/SSP5-8.5 and RCP4.5/SSP2-4.5 and for a 2oC global warming  (Mora et al., 2017; 
Nangombe et al., 2018; Sylla et al., 2018; Rohat et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2019b). In particular the equatorial 
regions where heat is combined with higher humidity levels, but also North Africa, the Sahel and Southern 
Africa (Figure 12.4d-f) are among the regions with largest increases of heat stress (Zhao et al., 2015; 
Ahmadalipour and Moradkhani, 2018; Coffel et al., 2018). Mitigation scenario make a large difference in 
frequency of exceedance of high heat stress indices thresholds (e.g., HI>41°C) by the end of the century 
(Figure 12.4d-f) (Schwingshackl et al., 2021). In West Africa and Central Africa, under SSP5-8.5, the 
expected number of days per year with HI>41°C will increase by around 200 days while in SSP1-2.6 such 
exceedances are expected to increase by less than 50 days per year (Figure 12.4). 
 
*Cold spell and frost:* Africa experiences cold events and frost days that can affect agriculture, infrastructure, 
health and ecosystems, especially in South and North Africa, which have marked cold seasons, and 
mountainous areas. Cold spells have likely decreased in frequency over subtropical areas. In particular, in 
North and Southern Africa, the frequency of cold events has likely decreased in the last few decades (Chapter 
11,11.3,11.9). There is a high confidence that cold spells and low target temperatures will decrease in future 
climates under all scenarios in West, Central and East Africa. Heating degree days will have a substantial 
decrease by the end of century for up to about one month under RCP8.5 in North and South Africa(Coppola 
et al., 2021b) (high confidence). 
 
*There is high confidence that extreme heat has increased in frequency and intensity in most African 
regions. Heatwaves and deadly heat stress and the frequency of exceedance of hot temperature 
thresholds (e.g., 35°C) will drastically increase by the end of the century (high confidence) under 
SSP5-8.5, but limited increases are expected in SSP1-2.6. Dangerous heat stress thresholds (HI>41°C) 
are projected to be crossed more than 200 days more in West and Central Africa under SSP5-8.5 while 
this increase remains limited to a few tens of days more for SSP1-2.6. Cold spells and frost days are 
projected to occur less frequently in all scenarios.* 
 
 
### 12.4.1.2   Wet and dry 
 
*Mean precipitation:* Since the mid-20th century, precipitation trends have varied in Africa but notable 
drying trends are found in east, central and north eastern part of South Africa, Central Africa, and in the 
Horn of Africa (Atlas 4.2). 
 
There is  high confidence in projected mean precipitation decreases in North Africa and West Southern 
Africa and medium confidence in East Southern Africa by the end of the 21st century (see also Dosio et al., 
2019; Gebrechorkos et al., 2019; Teichmann et al., 2020) (Atlas.4.5). The West Africa and Northern and 
Southern East Africa regions each feature a gradient in which precipitation decreases in the west and 
increases in the east (medium confidence) (Atlas.4.5), with trends in West Africa affecting the boreal summer 
monsoon (Chen et al., 2020). Increasing precipitation for a 1.5℃ and 2℃ global warming levels are found in 
central and eastern Sahel with low confidence and the wet signal is getting stronger and more extended for a 
3℃ and 4℃ warmer world (Atlas 1.1.5). 
 
A change in monsoon seasonality is also reported in West Africa and Sahel (low confidence) with a forward 
shift in time (later onset and end) (Mariotti et al., 2011; Seth et al., 2013; Ashfaq et al., 2020) (Chapter 8.2). 
This shift has been associated with a precipitation decrease during the monsoon season attributed to a 
decrease of African Easterly Wave activity in the 6-9 day regime (Mariotti et al., 2014) and a soil 
precipitation feedback reported in Mariotti et al. (2011). 
 
*River flood:* Generally in Africa from 1990 through 2014, annual flood frequencies have fluctuated and 
there is medium confidence in an upward trend in flood events occurrences (Li et al., 2016a). In particular, 
over West Africa, upward trends in hydrological extremes such as maximum peak discharge have likely 
occurred during the last few decades (i.e., after 1980) and have caused increased flood events in riparian 
countries of rivers such as Niger, Senegal and Volta (Nka et al., 2015; Aich et al., 2016; Wilcox et al., 2018; 
Tramblay et al., 2020) (high confidence). In Southern Africa, trends in flood occurrences are decreasing prior 
to 1980 and increasing afterwards (medium confidence) (Tramblay et al., 2020). 
 
Under future climate scenarios, the extreme river discharge as characterized by the 30 year return period of 
5-day average peak flow, is projected to increase by end of century for the RCP8.5 (more than 10% relative 
to 1960-1999 period) for most of the tropical African river basins (Dankers et al., 2014) and a consistent 
increase of flood magnitude across humid tropical Africa by 2050 for the AIB scenario (Arnell et al, 2014) 
(medium confidence) (Figure 12.5). Specifically, in West Africa there is not univocal pattern of change for 
future projections (Roudier et al., 2014) however under RCP8.5, there is a medium confidence of projected 
increase of 20-year flood magnitudes by 2050 in countries within the Niger river basin (Aich et al., 2016) 
and a low confidence (limited evidence) of an increase in extreme peak flows and their duration in countries 
of the Volta river basin by 2050 and 2090 (Jin et al., 2018). A significant median change of flood magnitude 
for the Gambia river (-4.5%) and for the Sessandra (+14.4%) and Niger (+6.1%) are projected under several 
scenario between mid and end of century (Roudier et al., 2014). In East Africa, extreme flows are projected 
to increase for region within the Blue Nile with low confidence (limited evidence) (Aich et al., 2014). 
However, uncertainty due to the climate scenario dominates the projection of extreme flows (Aich et al., 
2014; Krysanova et al., 2017) for the Blue Nile and Niger river basins. Averaged over the African continent 
for different levels of global warming, the present-day 100-year return period flood levels will have a return 
period of 40 years in 1.5℃ and 2℃ (Alfieri et al., 2017) and 21 years for 4℃ warmer climate (Hirabayashi 
et al., 2013b; Alfieri et al., 2017). 
 
*Heavy precipitation and pluvial flood:* Chapter 11 found that heavy precipitation intensity and frequency 
has likely increased over West Southern Africa but there is no evidence due to a lack of studies that any 
significant trend is observed in any other region. In addition, East Africa has experienced strong precipitation 
variability and intense wet spells leading to widespread pluvial flooding events hitting most countries 
including Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania (medium confidence). Finally, with respect to Southern 
Africa, heavy precipitations events have increased in frequency (medium confidence). 
 
In West Africa and Central Africa, there is high confidence that the intensity of extreme precipitation will 
increase in future climate under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios and 1.5oC and 2oC global warming 
levels threatening for widespread flood occurrences before, during and after the mature monsoon season. 
Extreme precipitation is also increasing in several other regions like SAH, NEAF, SEAF, ESAF and 
Madagascar (high confidence) for 2oC GWL and higher (Chapter 11).  
  
*Landslide:* There is an increase in reported landslides in WAF, CAF, NEAF and SEAF in the past decades 
but low evidence of significant trends (Gariano and Guzzetti, 2016; Haque et al., 2019). There is low 
confidence (limited evidence) of a future increase in landslides in Central-Eastern Africa, and literature is 
largely missing to assess this important hazard (Gariano and Guzzetti, 2016). 
 
*Aridity:* Section 11.9 assesses medium confidence in observed long-term declines of soil moisture and 
aridity indices in several African regions (NAF, WSAF, ESAF, MDG). Trends in East Africa are not 
definitive given uncertain balances between precipitation and potential evaporation (Kew et al., 2021). 
Projected declines in precipitation and soil moisture trends indicate high confidence in increased aridity over 
the 21st century in NAF, WSAF, ESAF, and MDG but low confidence elsewhere in Africa (Section 11.9; see 
also Figure 12.4j-l; Gizaw and Gan, 2017). A growing number of studies provide further regional context on 
expanding aridity in several places in East and West Africa, respectively (Sylla et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2018b; 
Haile et al., 2020).  
 
*Hydrological drought:* Section 11.9 noted observed decreases in hydrological drought over the 
Mediterranean (high confidence) and diminished summertime river flows in West Africa (medium 
confidence).  Recent regional modeling studies project substantial increases in hydrological drought affecting 
major West African river basins under 1.5oC and 2oC global warming levels and RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 
scenarios; however there remains low confidence in future projections given disagreement with global model 
runoff projections (e.g., Cook et al., 2020) (low confidence). There is high confidence that a 2 ℃ global 
warming level would see an increase in hydrological droughts in the Mediterranean region, and medium 
confidence in increasing hydrological drought conditions in the Southern Africa regions (Section 11.9). 
 
*Agricultural and ecological drought:* Farmers and food security experts in East Africa have noted spatial 
extensions in seasonal agricultural droughts in recent decades (Elagib, 2014), but it is difficult to disentangle 
these trends from climate variability. In Ethiopia, past severe agricultural drought conditions in the northern 
regions are moderately common events in recent years  (Zeleke et al., 2017). In Southern Africa, the number 
of “flash” droughts (with rapid onset and durations from a few days to couple of months) have increased by 
220% between 1961 and 2016 as a result of anthropogenic warming (Yuan et al., 2018). Section 11.9 notes 
medium confidence increases in agricultural and ecological drought trends in North, West and Central Africa 
as well as both Southern Africa regions.  The most striking drought is the Western Cape drought in 2015-
2018, a prolonged drought which resulted in acute water shortages (Wolski, 2018; Burls et al., 2019) 
(Section 10.6.2). Anthropogenic climate change caused a threefold increase in the probability of such a 
drought to occur (Botai et al., 2017; Otto et al., 2018) (see also Chapters 10 and 11). Section 11.9 assesses 
increases in agricultural and ecological drought at 2℃ global warming level for North Africa and West 
Southern Africa (high confidence) and for East Southern Africa and Madagascar (medium confidence), with 
confidence generally rising for higher emissions scenarios (see also Sylla et al., 2016; Zhao and Dai, 2017; 
Diedhiou et al., 2018; Abiodun et al., 2019; Todzo et al., 2020; Coppola et al., 2021). Liu et al. (2018) 
identified the Southern Africa region as the drought ‘hottest spot’ in Africa in 1.5 and 2 ºC global warming 
scenarios.   
 
*Fire weather:* There is low confidence (low agreement) in recent reductions in fire activity given soil 
moisture increases in some regions and substantial land use changes (Andela et al., 2017; Forkel et al., 2019; 
Zubkova et al., 2019). Days prone to fire conditions are going to increase in all extratropical Africa for end 
of century and fire weather indices are projected to largely increase in North and South Africa, where 
increasing aridity trends occur (high confidence), with an emerging signal well before the middle of the 
century where drought and heat increase will combine (Chapter 11) (Engelbrecht et al., 2015; Abatzoglou et 
al., 2019). There is low confidence (low evidence) of fire weather changes for other African regions. 
 
*Total precipitation is projected to decrease in the northernmost (high confidence) and southernmost 
regions of Africa (medium confidence), with West and East Africa regions each having a west-to-east 
pattern of decreasing-to-increasing precipitation (medium confidence).  Most African regions will 
undergo an increase in heavy precipitation that can lead to pluvial floods (high confidence), even as 
increasing dry climatic impact-drivers (aridity, hydrological, agricultural and ecological droughts, fire 
weather) are generally projected in the North Africa and Southern African regions (high confidence) 
and western portions of West Africa (medium confidence).* 

### 12.4.1.3  Wind  
 
*Mean wind speed:* Decreasing trends in wind speeds have occurred in many parts of Africa (McVicar et al., 
2012; AR5 WGI) (low confidence due to observations with limited homogeneity). There is high confidence 
in climate-change induced future decreasing mean wind, wind energy potential and strong winds in North 
Africa and Mediterranean regions as a consequence of the poleward shift of the Hadley cell (Karnauskas et 
al., 2018a; Kjellström et al., 2018; Sivakumar and Lucio, 2018; Tobin et al., 2018; Jung and Schindler, 2019) 
in the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios by the middle of the century or beyond, and for a global warming level 
of 2°C or higher. Over West Africa and South Africa a future significant increase in wind speeds and wind 
energy potential is expected (medium confidence) (Karnauskas et al., 2018a; Jung and Schindler, 2019) (see 
also Figure 12.4m-o). 
 
*Severe wind storm:* A limited number of studies allow an assessment of past trends in wind storms. In West 
Africa and specifically in the Sahel band, more intense storms have occurred since the 1980s (low 
confidence, limited evidence). A persistent and large increase of frequency of Sahelian mesoscale convective 
storms has been found in several studies (Panthou et al., 2014; Taylor et al., 2017b), with consequences for 
extreme rainfalls, and potentially on extreme winds (low confidence, limited evidence). There is low 
confidence of a general increasing trend in extreme winds across West, Central, East and South Africa in a 
majority of regions by the middle of the century even in high-end scenarios. The frequency of Mediterranean 
wind storms reaching North Africa, including Medicanes, is projected to decrease, but their intensities are 
projected to increase, by the mid-century and beyond under SRES A1B, A2 and RCP8.5, (Cavicchia et al.; 
Walsh et al., 2014; Tous et al., 2016; Romera et al., 2017; Romero and Emanuel, 2017; González‐Alemán et 
al., 2019) (Chapter 11) (medium confidence). 
 
*Tropical cyclone.* In the Southern Indian ocean, an increase of Category 5 cyclones has been observed in 
recent decades (Fitchett, 2018) as in other basins (Section 11.7). However, there is a projected decrease in 
the frequency of tropical cyclones making landfall over Madagascar, South Eastern Africa and East South 
Africa in a 1°C,  2°C and 3ºC warmer world (medium confidence) (Malherbe et al., 2013; Roberts et al., 
2015, 2020; Muthige et al., 2018; Knutson et al., 2020). There is medium confidence in general increasing 
intensities for cyclones in such studies for African regions. 
 
*Sand and dust storm:* North Africa and the Sahel, and to a lesser extent South Africa, are prone to dust 
storms, having consequences on health (Querol et al., 2019), transmission of infectious diseases (Agier et al., 
2013; Wu et al., 2016), and solar power generation and related maintenance costs. There is limited evidence 
and low agreement of secular 20th century trends in wind speeds or dust emissions (limited length of data 
records, large variability). Dust variations are controlled by changes in surface winds, precipitation and 
vegetation, which in turn are modulated at multiple time scales by dominant modes of internal climate 
variability (see Chapter 10). In North Africa, wind variability explains both the observed high concentrations 
between the 1970s and 1980s and lower concentrations thereafter (Ridley et al., 2014; Evan et al., 2016). 
Yet, the effect of vegetation changes may not be negligible (Pu and Ginoux, 2017, 2018).  
 
Changes to the frequency and intensity of dust storms also remain largely uncertain due to uncertainty in 
future regional wind and precipitation as the climate warms, CO2 fertilization effects on vegetation (Huang et 
al., 2017), and anthropogenic land use  and land cover change due to land management and invasive species 
(Ginoux et al., 2012; Webb and Pierre, 2018). Dust loadings and related air pollution hazards (from fine 
particles that affect health) are projected to generally decrease in many regions of the Sahara and Sahel due 
to the changing winds (Evan et al., 2016) and slightly increase over the Guinea Coast and West Africa (low 
confidence) (Ji et al., 2018). 
 
*In summary, there is high confidence of a decrease in mean wind speed and wind energy potential in 
North Africa and medium confidence of an increase in South and West Africa, by the middle of the 
century regardless of climate scenario or global warming level equal or superior to 2°C, high 
confidence of a decrease in frequency of cyclones landing in SEAF, ESAF and MDG, and low 
confidence of a general increase in wind storms in most of African regions located Southward of Sahel. 
The evolution of dust storms remains largely uncertain.* 

### 12.4.1.4   Snow and Ice 
 
*Snow and glacier:* African glaciers are located in East Africa and more specifically on Mount Kenya, the 
Rwenzori Mountains and Mount Kilimanjaro, with glaciers reducing substantially in each region (high 
confidence) (Taylor et al., 2006; Cullen et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2018; Prinz et al., 2018; Wang and Zhou, 
2019). Observation and future projection of African glacier mass changes are assessed in Section 9.5.1 
within the Low Latitude glacier region, which is one of the regions with the largest mass loss even under 
low-emission scenarios (assessment of this region is dominated by glaciers in the South American Andes, 
however) (high confidence). Glaciers in the Low Latitude region will lose 67 ± 42%, 86 ± 24% and 94 ± 
13% of their mass in 2015 by the end of the century for RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively 
(Marzeion et al., 2020).  Cullen et al., (2013) calculated that even imbalances between the Mount 
Kilimanjaro glaciers and present-day climate would be enough to eliminate the mountain’s glaciers by 2060. 
Snow water equivalent and snow cover season duration also decline in the East African mountains, Ethiopian 
Highlands, and Atlas Mountains with climate change (high confidence) (López-Moreno et al., 2017). 
 
*In conclusion, there is high confidence that African snow and glaciers have very significantly 
decreased in the last decades and that this trend will continue over the 21st century.* 
 
 
### 12.4.1.5   Coastal and Oceanic  
 
*Relative sea level:* Around Africa, over 1900-2018, a new tide-gauge based reconstruction finds a regional-
mean RSL change of 2.07 [1.36–2.77] mm yr<sup>-1</sup> in the South Atlantic and 1.33 [0.80-1.86] mm yr<sup>-1</sup> in the 
Indian Ocean (Frederikse et al., 2020), compared to a GMSL change of around 1.7 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> (Section 2.3.3.3; 
Table 9.5). For the period 1993-2018, these RSLR rates, based on satellite altimetry, increased to 3.45 [3.04-
3.86] mm yr<sup>-1</sup> and 3.65 [3.23-4.08] mm yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively (Frederikse et al., 2020), compared to a GMSL 
change of 3.25 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> (Section 2.3.3.3; Table 9.5).  
 
Relative sea-level rise is virtually certain to continue in the oceans around Africa. Regional-mean RSLR 
projections for the oceans around Africa range from 0.4 m–0.5 m under SSP1-2.6 to 0.8 m–0.9 m under 
SSP5-8.5 for 2081-2100 relative to 1995-2014 (median values), which is within the range of projected 
GMSL change {Section 9.6.3.3}. These RSLR projections may however be underestimated due to potential 
partial representation of land subsidence in their assessment (Section 9.6.3.2). 
 
*Coastal flood:* The present day 1:100 yr Extreme Total Water Level is between 0.1 m – 1.2 m around Africa, 
with values around 1 m or above along the South West, South East and Central East coasts (Vousdoukas et 
al., 2018).  
 
Extreme total water level (ETWL) magnitude and occurrence frequency are expected to increase throughout 
the region (high confidence) (see Figure 12.4p-r and Figure SM 12.6). Across the region, the 5th – 95th 
percentile range of the 1:100 yr ETWL is projected increase (relative to 1980 – 2014) by 7 cm – 36 cm and 
by 14 cm – 42 cm by 2050 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. By 2100, this range is projected to be 28 
cm – 86 cm and 43 cm – 190 cm under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively (Vousdoukas et al., 2018; Kirezci 
et al., 2020). In terms of ETWL occurrence frequencies, the present day 1:100 yr ETWL is projected to have 
median return periods of around 1:10-1:20 yrs  by 2050 and 1:1-1:5  yrs by 2100 in Southern and North 
Africa and occur more than once per year by 2050 and 2100 in most of East and West Africa under RCP4.5 
(Vousdoukas et al., 2018). The present day 1:50 yr ETWL is projected to occur around 3 times a year by 
2100 with a SLR of 1 m in Africa (Vitousek et al., 2017).  
 
*Coastal erosion:*  Shoreline retreat rates upto 1 m yr<sup>-1</sup> have been observed around the continent during 1984 
– 2015, except in ESAF which has experienced a shoreline progration rate of 0.1 m/r over the same period 
(Luijendijk et al., 2018; Mentaschi et al., 2018). (Mentaschi et al., 2018) report a coastal area losses of 160 
km2 and 460 km2 over a 30 year period (1984-2015) along the Atlantic and Indian ocean coasts of the 
continent. At the more regional level, in Ghana along the Gulf of Guinea, about 79% of the shoreline was 
found to be retreating while 21% was found to be stable or prograding over the period 1974–1996 (Addo and 
Addo, 2016).  
 
Projections indicate that a vast majority of sandy coasts in the region will experience shoreline retreat 
throughout the 21st century (high confidence), while parts of the ESAF and west MDG coastline are 
projected to prograde over the 21st century, if present ambient trends continue. Median shoreline change 
projections (CMIP5), relative to 2010, presented by Vousdoukas et al. (2020) show that, under RCP4.5, 
shorelines in Africa will retreat by between 30 m (SAH, NEAF, WSAF, ESAF, MDG) and 55 m (WAF, 
CAF), by mid-century. By the same period but under RCP8.5, the median shoreline retreat is projected to be 
between 35 m (SAH, NEAF, WSAF, ESAF) and 65 m (WAF, CAF). By 2100, more than 100 m of median 
retreat is projected in WAF, CAF and SEAF under RCP4.5, while under RCP8.5, more than 100 m of 
shoreline retreat is projected in all regions except NEAF and WSAF.  Under RCP8.5 especially, the 
projected retreat by 2100 is greater than 150 m in WAF and CAF. The total length of sandy coasts in Africa 
that is projected to retreat by more than a median of 100 m by 2100 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 is about 
13,000 km and 17,000 km respectively, an increase of approximately 33%. 
 
*Marine heatwave:* Over 1982-2016, the coastal oceans of Africa has experienced on average 2.0–3.0 MHW 
per year, with the coastal oceans around the southern half of the continent experiencing on average 2.5–3 
MHWs per year. The average duration was between 5 and 15 days (Oliver et al., 2018). Changes over the 
20th century, derived from MHW proxies, show an increase in frequency between 0.5 and 2.0 MHW per 
decade over the region, especially off the Horn of Africa; an increase in intensity per event around South 
Africa; and an increase in MHW duration along the North African coastlines (Oliver et al., 2018). 
  
There is high confidence that MHWs will increase around Africa. Mean SST, a common proxy for MHWs, is 
projected to increase by 1 ºC (2ºC) around Africa by 2100, with a hotspot of around 2 ºC (5ºC) along the 
coastlines of South Africa under RCP4.5 (RCP8.5) (see Interactive Atlas). Under global warming conditions, 
MHW intensity and duration will increase in the coastal zones of all subregions of Africa (Frölicher et al., 
2018). Projections for SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 both show an increase in MHWs around Australasia by 2081 
– 2100, relative to 1985 – 2014 (Box 9.2, Figure 1). 
 
*In general, there is high confidence that most coastal and ocean related hazards in Africa will increase 
over the 21st century. Relative sea-level rise is virtually certain to continue around Africa, contributing 
to increased coastal flooding in low-lying areas (high confidence) and shoreline retreat along most 
sandy coasts (high confidence). Marine Heatwaves are also expected to increase around the region 
over the 21st century (high confidence).*
 
The assessed direction of change in CIDs for Africa and associated confidence levels are illustrated in Table 
12.3. No relevant literature could be found for permafrost and hail, although these phenomena may be 
relevant in parts of the continent.

## 12.4.2  Asia 
 
According to the region definitions given in Chapter 1, Asia is divided into 11 regions: the Arabian 
Peninsula (ARP), Western Central Asia (WCA), West Siberia (WSB), East Siberia (ESB), the Russian Far 
East (RFE), East Asia (EAS), East Central Asia (ECA), the Tibetan Plateau (TIB), South Asia (SAS), South-
East Asia (SEA) and the Russian Arctic Region (RAR). CID changes in RAR are assessed in the Polar 
Region section (12.4.9). As assessed in previous IPCC reports, major concerns in Asia are associated 
particularly with droughts and floods in all regions, heat extremes in SAS and EAS, sand-dust storms in 
WCA, tropical cyclones in SEA and EAS, snow cover and glacier changes in ECA and the Hindu Kush 
Himalaya (HKH) region, and sea ice and permafrost thawing in North Asia.  
 
Since AR5, a large body of new literature is now available relevant to climate change in Asia, which 
includes projections of both mean climate and extreme climate phenomena from global and regional 
ensembles of climate simulations such as CMIP6 and CORDEX (see Chapter 10 and the Atlas). Literature 
has also considerably grown on several climate topics relevant to Asia such as the mountain climate (see in 
particular Chapter 3 of the SROCC), and the novel regional assessments such as the Hindu Kush Himalaya 
Assessment (Wester et al., 2019). Figure 12.6 shows the regional changes in indices related to floods, and 
coastal erosion over Asia, which are assessed on a regional basis along with other climatic impact-driver 
indices below.   
 
<figref>12.6</figref> 
 
### 12.4.2.1  Heat and cold 
 
*Mean air temperature:* A long-term warming trend in annual mean surface temperature has been observed 
across Asia during 1960-2015, and the warming accelerated after the 1970s (high confidence) (Davi et al., 
2015; Aich et al., 2017; Cheong et al., 2018; Dong et al., 2018a; IPCC, 2018; Krishnan et al., 2019; Zhang et 
al., 2019a). Records also indicate a higher rate of warming in minimum temperatures than maximum 
temperatures in Asia, leading to more frequent warm nights and warm days, and less frequent cold days and 
cold nights (high confidence) (Supari et al., 2017; Akperov et al., 2018; Cheong et al., 2018; Rahimi et al., 
2018; Khan et al., 2019a; Li et al., 2019a; Zhang et al., 2019a).  
 
Projections show continued warming over Asia in the future with contrasted regional patterns across the 
continent (high confidence) (see Chapter 4 Figure 4.19). For RCP8.5/SSP5-8.5 at the end of the century, the 
mean estimated warming exceeds 5°C in WSB, ESB and RFE and 7°C in some parts (high confidence). In 
most areas of ARP and WCA, 5°C is exceded (Ozturk et al., 2017), but EAS, SAS and SEA have a lower 
projected warming of less than 5°C (Basha et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2019a; Almazroui et al., 2020) (see also 
Atlas.5). Under SSP1-2.6, the warming remains limited to 2°C in most areas except Arctic regions where it 
exceeds 2°C (Chapter 4 Figure 4.19).  
 
*Extreme heat:* There are increased evidences and high confidence of more frequent heat extremes in the 
recent decades than in previous ones in most of Asia (Acar Deniz and Gönençgil, 2015; Rohini et al., 2016; 
Mishra et al., 2017a; You et al., 2017; Imada et al., 2018; Khan et al., 2019b; Krishnan et al., 2019; Rahimi 
et al., 2019; Yin et al., 2019) (Chapter 11) due to the effects of anthropogenic global warming, El Niño and 
urbanization (Luo and Lau, 2017; Thirumalai et al., 2017; Imada et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2019c; Zhou et al., 
2019). But there is medium confidence of heat extremes increasing frequency in many parts of India (Rohini 
et al., 2016; Mazdiyasni et al., 2017; van Oldenborgh et al., 2018; Roy, 2019; Kumar et al., 2020) partly due 
to the alleviation of anthropogenic warming by increased air pollution with aerosols and expanding irrigation 
(van Oldenborgh et al., 2018; Thiery et al., 2020).  
 
Extreme heat events are very likely to become more intense and/or more frequent in SAS, WCA, ARP, EAS, 
and SEA by the end of 21st century, especially under RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (Lelieveld et al., 2016; Pal and 
Eltahir, 2016; Guo et al., 2017; Mishra et al., 2017a; Dosio et al., 2018; Shin et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2018; 
Nasim et al., 2018; Su and Dong, 2019; Hong et al., 2019; Khan et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020) (see Figure 
12.4a-c, and Chapter 11). The exceedance of the dangerous heat stress 41°C threshold of the HI is expected 
to increase by about 250 days in SEA and by 50-150 days in SAS, WCA, ARP and EAS for SSP5-8.5 at the 
end of century. Under SSP1-2.6, the increase would be restricted to less than 30 days in many of these 
regions except SEA where the number of exceedance days increases by about 100 days in some areas. Such 
increases are already present in the middle of the century (see Figure 12.4d-f) (Schwingshackl et al., 2021). 

In these regions, the increase in number of days with exceedance of 35°C of high heat stress is also expected 
to increase substantially for the mid-century under SSP5-8.5 (typically by 10-50 days except in Arctic and 
Siberian regions), and by more than 60 days in areas of SEA, and a large difference is found between low 
and high-end scenarios in the end of the century (high confidence) (Figure 12.4b). Over WSB, ESB and RFE 
also, an increase of extreme heat durations and frequency is expected in all scenarios (Kattsov et al., 2017; 
Khlebnikova et al., 2019a) (high confidence). 
 
*Cold spell and frost:* Cold spells intensity and frequency, as well as the number of frost days, in most Asian 
regions have been decreasing since the beginning of the 20th century (high confidence) (Sheikh et al., 2015; 
Donat et al., 2016; Erlat and Türkeş, 2016; Dong et al., 2018a; Liao et al., 2018, 2020; Lu et al., 2018; van 
Oldenborgh et al., 2019) (Chapter 11), except for the central Eurasian regions where there was a cooling 
trend during 1995–2014 which is linked to sea-ice loss in the Barents–Kara Seas (medium confidence) 
(Wegmann et al., 2018; Blackport et al., 2019; Mori et al., 2019) (Atlas.5.2). 
 
It is very likely that cold spells will have a decreasing frequency in all future scenarios across Asian regions 
(Guo et al., 2018b; Sui et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019a), as well as frost days (Wang et al., 2017c; Fallah-
Ghalhari et al., 2019) except in tropical Asia (Chapter 11).  
 
*In Asia, temperatures have warmed along the last century (high confidence) and extreme heat episodes 
have become more frequent in most regions (high confidence), and are very likely projected to increase 
in all regions of Asia under all warming scenarios along this century. Dangerous heat stress thresholds 
such as HI>41°C will be crossed much more often (typically 50-150 days per year more than recent 
past) in many Southern Asia regions at the end of century under SSP5-8.5 while these numbers should 
remain limited to a few tens under SSP1-2.6 (high confidence). It is very likely that cold spells and frost 
days will decrease in frequency in all future scenarios across Asian regions along the century.*  
 
 
### 12.4.2.2  Wet and dry 
 
*Mean precipitation:* The most prominent features about changes in precipitation over Asia (1901-2010) are 
the increasing precipitation trends across higher latitudes, along with some scattered smaller regions of 
detectable increases and decreases (Knutson and Zeng, 2018); however, spatial variability remains high 
(Wang et al., 2015b, 2019a; Limsakul and Singhruck, 2016; Supari et al., 2017; Rahimi et al., 2018, 2019; 
Sein et al., 2018; Kumar et al., 2019) (medium confidence) (see also Atlas.5). 
 
Mean precipitation is likely to increase in most areas of Northern (WSB, ESB, RFE), Southern (ECA, TIB, 
SAS) and East Asia (EAS) in different scenarios (Huang et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2017; Kusunoki, 2018; 
Mandapaka and Lo, 2018; Luo et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2019b; Almazroui et al., 2020; Jiang 
et al., 2020; Rai et al., 2020) (high confidence) (see Atlas.5). Monsoon circulation will also increase seasonal 
contrasts, with SAS seeing wetter wet seasons and drier dry seasons (Atlas.5.3).  Higher uncertainty between 
CMIP5 and CMIP6 as well as spatial differences lend low confidence to model projections in ARP and WCA 
(Atlas.5.5), with large seasonal differences (Zhu et al., 2020) and some models projecting decreases in 
precipitation in Central Asia (Ozturk et al., 2017), Pakistan (Nabeel and Athar, 2020) and SEA (Supari et al., 
2020).  
 
*River flood:* Flood risk has grown in many places in China from 1961 to 2017 (Kundzewicz et al., 2019) (low 
confidence). In SAS, the numbers of flood events and human fatalities have increased in India during 1978–
2006  (Singh  and  Kumar,  2013),  whereas  the  average  country-wide  inundation  depth  has  been  decreasing 
during  2002 to 2010  in  Bangladesh  attributed  to  improved flood management  (Sciance and  Nooner,  2018) 
(low confidence). 
 
Given the increase of heavy precipitation in most Asian regions the river flood frequency and intensities will 
change consequently in Asia. Over China floods will increase with different levels under different warming 
scenarios (Lin et al., 2018; Kundzewicz et al., 2019; Liang et al., 2019; Gu et al., 2020) (medium 
confidence). Monsoon floods will be more intense in SAS (medium confidence) (Nowreen et al., 2015; Babur 
et al., 2016; Mohammed et al., 2018). The total flood damage will increase greatly in river basins in SEA 
countries under the conditions of climate change and rapid urbanization in the near future (Dahal et al., 2018; 
Kefi et al., 2020). A changing snowmelt regime in the mountains may contribute to a shift of spring floods to 
earlier periods in Central Asia in future (Reyer et al., 2017b) (medium confidence). The annual maximum 
river discharge can almost double by the mid-21st century in major Siberian rivers, and annual maximum 
flood area is projected to increase across Siberia mostly by 2–5% relative to the baseline period (1990–1999) 
under RCP8.5 scenario (Shkolnik et al., 2018) (medium confidence).  

*Heavy precipitation and pluvial flood*  
Pluvial floods are driven by extreme precipitation and land use. Observed changes in extreme precipitation 
vary considerably by region (see also Chapter 11). Heavy precipitation is very likely to become more intense 
and frequent in all areas of Asia except in ARP (medium confidence) for a 2oC GWL or higher (see Chapter 
11). 
 
*Landslide:* The majority of non-seismic fatal landslide events were triggered by rainfall, and Asia is the 
dominant geographical area of landslide distribution (Froude and Petley, 2018). Floods and landslides are the 
most frequently occurring natural hazards in the eastern Himalaya and hilly regions, particularly caused by 
torrential rain during the monsoon season (Gaire et al., 2015; Syed and Al Amin, 2016). They accounted for 
nearly half of the events recorded in the countries of the HKH region (Vaidya et al., 2019). Intense monsoon 
rainfall in northern India and western Nepal in 2013, which led to landslides and one of the worst floods in 
history, has been linked to increased loading of GHG and aerosols (Cho et al., 2016). Due to an increase of 
heavy precipitation and permafrost thawing an increase in landslides is expected in some areas of Asia, such 
as northern Taiwan of China, some South Korea mountains, Himalaya Mountains, and permafrost territories 
of Siberia, and the increase is expected to be the greatest over areas covered by current glaciers and glacial 
lakes  (Kim et al., 2015; Kharuk et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2019a; Kirschbaum et al., 2020) (medium 
confidence, medium evidence).  
 
*Aridity:* Aridity in West Central Asia and parts of South Asia increased in recent decades (medium 
confidence), as documented in Afghanistan (Qutbudin et al., 2019), Iran (Zarei et al., 2016; Zolfaghari et al., 
2016; Pour et al., 2020), most parts of Pakistan (Ahmed et al., 2018, 2019a), and many parts of India (Roxy 
et al., 2015; Mallya et al., 2016; Matin and Behera, 2017; Ramarao et al., 2019). Some spatial and seasonal 
differences within these regions remain, with Ambika and Mishra (2020) noting significant  aridity declines 
over the Indo-Gangetic Plain in India during 1979–2018 due in part to the effect of irrigation and Araghi et 
al. (2018) found that many parts of Iran show no significant trends in aridity. There was slight drying in dry 
season and significant wetting in wet season in Philippines during 1951–2010 (Villafuerte et al., 2014), and 
slight wetting in Viet Nam during 1980-2017 (Stojanovic et al., 2020) (low confidence). In EAS there is low 
confidence of broad aridity changes, as the frequency of droughts have increased (especially in spring) along 
a strip extending from southwest China to the western part of northeast China; however, there is no evidence 
of a significant increase in drought severity over China as a whole and many parts in the arid northwest 
China got wetter during 1961-2012 (Wang et al., 2015b, 2019a; Zhai et al., 2017; Zhang and Shen, 2019). In 
Siberia, the number of dry days has decreased for much of the region, but increased in its southern parts 
(Khlebnikova et al., 2019b). 
 
The counteracting factors of projected increases in precipitation and temperature across most of Asia 
(Atlas.5; Section 11.9) leads to low confidence (limited evidence, inconsistent trends) for broad, long-term 
aridity changes with medium confidence only for aridity increases in West Central Asia and East Asia. A 
growing number of studies highlight the potential for more localized aridity trends, including projection 
ensembles indicating significant increase in aridity and more frequent and intense droughts in most parts of 
China (Li et al., 2019b; Yao et al., 2020) and India under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 for 2020-2100 period (Gupta 
and Jain, 2018; Bisht et al., 2019; Preethi et al., 2019).  
 
*Hydrological drought:* Section 11.9 indicates that limited evidence and inconsistent regional trends gives 
low confidence to observed and projected changes in hydrological drought in all Asian regions at a 2℃ GWL 
(approximately mid-century), although West Central Asia hydrological droughts increase at the 4℃ global 
warming level (approximately end-of-century under higher emissions scenarios) (medium confidence).  

Human activities such as reservoir operation and water abstraction have had a profound effect on low river 
flow characteristics and drought impacts in many Asian regions (Kazemzadeh and Malekian, 2016; Yang et 
al., 2020b). There was no observed overall long-term change of both meteorological droughts and 
hydrological droughts over India during 1870-2018 (Mishra, 2020), but there were strong trends toward 
drying of soil moisture in north-central India (Ganeshi et al., 2020) and intensified droughts in northwest 
India, parts of Peninsular India, and Myanmar (Malik et al., 2016). The frequency of water scarcity 
connected with hydrological droughts has increased significantly in southern Russia since the beginning of 
twenty-first century (Frolova et al., 2017). Higher future temperatures are expected to alter the seasonal 
profile of hydrologic droughts given reduced summertime snowmelt (medium confidence) downstream of 
mountains such as the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau (Sorg et al., 2014). Several studies project more 
severe future hydrological drought in the Weihe River basin in northern China (Yuan et al., 2016; Sun and 
Zhou, 2020).  
 
*Agricultural and ecological drought:* Section 11.9 assesses medium confidence in observed increases to 
agricultural and ecological droughts in West Central Asia, East Central Asia, and East Asia.  Persistent 
droughts were the main factor for grassland degradation and desertification in Central Asia in the early 21st 
century (Zhang et al., 2018b; Emadodin et al., 2019). Compound meteorological drought and heat events, 
which lead to water stress conditions for agricultural and ecological systems, have become more frequent, 
widespread and persistent in China especially since the late 1990s (Yu and Zhai, 2020). There were more 
agricultural droughts in north China than in south China, and the intensity of agricultural drought increased 
during 1951-2018 (Zhao et al., 2021).  
 
Studies examining a 2℃ global warming level give low confidence for projected broad changes to 
agricultural and ecological drought across all Asia regions, although at the 4℃ global warming level 
agricultural and ecological drought increases are projected for West Central Asia and East Asia along with a 
decrease in South Asia (medium confidence) (Section 11.9). Summertime temperature increase will enhance 
evapotranspiration, facilitating ecological and agricultural drought over Central Asia towards the latter half 
of this century (Ozturk et al., 2017; Reyer et al., 2017b; Senatore et al., 2019) (see also Figure 12.4 for soil 
moisture and DF indices) (see also Chapter 11). However, broader changes in droughts could not be 
determined in Asia due to the mixture of total precipitation signals together with temperature increase 
patterns (Section 11.9; Atlas.5). 
 
*Fire weather:* Under the global warming scenario of 2°C, the magnitude of length and frequency of fire 
seasons are projected to increase with strong effects in India, China and Russia (Sun et al., 2019b) (medium 
confidence). (Abatzoglou et al., 2019) found that higher fire weather conditions due to climate change 
emerge in the first part of the 21st century in South China, WCA as well as in boreal areas of Siberia and 
RFE. The potential burned areas in five Central Asian countries (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, 
Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan) will increase by 2%-8% in the 2030s and 3%-13% in the 2080s compared 
with the baseline (1971-2000) (Zong et al., 2020) (medium confidence).  
 
*In conclusion, there is medium confidence in that extreme precipitation, mean precipitation and river 
floods will increase across most Asian regions. There is low confidence for projected changes in aridity 
and drought given overall increases in precipitation and regional inconsistencies, with medium 
increases for West Central Asia and East Asia especially beyond the middle of the century and global 
warming levels beyond 2℃.  Fire weather seasons are projected to lengthen and intensify particularly 
in the northern regions (medium confidence).*   
 
 
### 12.4.2.3  Wind  
 
*Mean wind speed:* There is high confidence of the slowdown in terrestrial near-surface wind speed (SWS) 
in Asia by approximately -0.1 m s-1 per decade since 1950s based on observations and reanalysis data, with 
the significant decreases in Central Asia among the highest in the world followed by EAS and SAS (Tian et 
al., 2019; Wu et al., 2018b; Zhang et al., 2019b). But a short-term strengthening in SWS was observed 
during the winter since 2000 in Eastern China (Zeng et al., 2019; Zha et al., 2019) (medium confidence).   

There is medium confidence of future declining mean SWS in Asia, except in SAS and SEA, as global 
projections indicate a decreasing trend in all climate scenarios for most of North Asia, TIB and East Asia by 
the mid-century (Karnauskas et al., 2018a; Fedotova, 2019; Jung and Schindler, 2019; Ohba, 2019; Wu et 
al., 2020a; Zha et al., 2020) (see also Figure 12.4m-o), with negative effects on wind energy potential. 
Decreases in North Asia are generally modest, not exceeding 10% for the mid-century and 20% for the end 
of century for the RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenarios (Figure 12.4m-o).  
 
*Severe wind storms:* Consistent with the general mean decreasing surface winds, there is medium 
confidence that strong winds declined faster than weak winds in the past few decades in Asia in general 
(Vautard et al., 2010; Tian et al., 2019), but evidence is lacking for spatial patterns. There is low confidence 
that extra-tropical cyclones will decline in number in future climate scenarios over WCA, TIB, WSB and 
ESB, and intensify over the Arctic regions as a result of the poleward shift of storm-tracks (Basu et al., 2018) 
(see also Chapter 11). There is limited evidence for projection of changes in severe winds occurring in 
convective storms in Asia. 
 
*Tropical cyclone:* There was an increase in the number and intensification rate of intense tropical cyclones 
(TC), such as category 4-5 (wind speeds greater than 58 m s-1), in the Western North Pacific (WNP) and Bay 
of Bengal since the mid-1980s (Kim et al., 2016; Mei and Xie, 2016; Walsh et al., 2016a; Knutson et al., 
2019) (medium confidence) (see also Section 11.7). There is medium confidence that there has been a 
significant north-westward shift in TC tracks and a poleward shift in the average latitude where TCs reach 
their peak intensity in the WNP since the 1980s (Knutson et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2019a; Lee et al., 2020), 
increasing exposure to TC passage and more destructive landfall over east China, Japan, and Korea in the 
last few decades (Kossin et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017; Altman et al., 2018; Liu and Chan, 2019), and 
decreasing exposure in the region of SAS and southern China (Kossin et al., 2016; Cinco et al., 2016) (see 
also Chapter 11). However, while the analysis shows fewer typhoons, more extreme TCs have affected the 
Philippines (Cinco et al., 2016; Takagi and Esteban, 2016) (low confidence). The frequency and duration of 
tropical cyclones has significantly increased over time over the Arabian Sea and insignificantly decreased 
over the Bay of Bengal during 1977-2018 (Fan et al., 2020) (low confidence). 
 
There is medium confidence that future TC numbers will decrease but the maximum TC wind intensities will 
increase in the Western Pacific as elsewhere (Choi et al., 2019; Cha et al., 2020; Knutson et al., 2020) 
(Chapter 11, see Figure 11.24). The simulations for the late 21st century for the RCP8.5 scenario yield 
considerably more TCs in the WNP that exceed 49.4 m s−1 (Category 3) intensity (Mclay et al., 2019). There 
is medium confidence that the average location of the maximum wind will migrate poleward (see Chapter 
11), and TC translation speeds at the higher latitudes would decrease (Yamaguchi et al., 2020). As a 
consequence, the intensity of TCs affecting the Japan Islands would increase in the future under the RCP8.5 
scenario (Yoshida et al., 2017), whereas the frequency of TCs affecting the Philippine region and Vietnam is 
projected to decrease (Kieu-Thi et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017b; Gallo et al., 2019) (low confidence).  
 
*Sand and dust storm:* The Asia-Pacific region contributes 26.8 per cent to global dust emissions as of 2012 
(UNESCAP, 2018). In West Asia, the frequency of dust events has increased markedly in some areas (east 
and northeast of Saudi Arabia, northwest of Iraq and east of Syria) from 1980 to the present (Nabavi et al., 
2016; Alobaidi et al., 2017). This marked dust increase has been associated to drought conditions in the 
Fertile Crescent (Notaro et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2015) likely amplified by anthropogenic warming (Kelley et 
al., 2015) (see Chapter 10). Dust storm frequency in most regions of northern China show a decreasing trend 
since the 1960s due to the decrease in surface wind speed (Guan et al., 2017) (medium confidence). 
 
While dust activity has decreased greatly over EAS, current climate models are unable to reproduce the 
trends (Guan et al., 2015, 2017; Zha et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2018a). Thus, there is limited evidence for future 
trends of sand and dust storms in Asia. 
 
*In conclusion, surface wind speeds have been decreasing in Asia (high confidence), but there is a large 
uncertainty in future trends. There is medium confidence that mean wind speeds will decrease in 
Central and Northern Asia, and that tropical cyclones will have decreasing frequency and increasing 
intensity overall.* 

### 12.4.2.4  Snow and Ice 
 
*Snow:* There is no significant interannual trend of total snow cover from 2000 to 2016 over Eurasia (Wang et 
al., 2017e; Sun et al., 2020).  Observations do show significant changes in the seasonal timing of Eurasian 
snow cover extent (especially for earlier spring snowmelt) since the 1970s, with seasonal changes expected 
to continue in the future (high confidence) (Yeo et al., 2017; Zhong et al., 2021).  By 2100, snowline 
elevations are projected to rise between 400 and 900 m (4.4 to 10.0 m yr<sup>-1</sup>) in the Indus, Ganges, and 
Brahmaputra basins under RCP8.5 scenario (Viste and Sorteberg, 2015).  
 
*Glacier:* Observation and future projection of glacier mass changes in Asia are assessed in Section 9.5.1 
grouped in three main regions: North Asia, High Mountains of Asia, and Caucuses and Middle East. All 
regions show continuing decline in glacier mass and area in the coming century (high confidence).  Under 
RCP2.6 the pace of glacier loss slows, but glacier losses increase in RCP8.5 and peak in the mid to late 21st 
century. GlacierMIP projections indicate that glaciers in the High Mountains of Asia lose 42 ± 25%, 
56 ± 24%, and 71 ± 21% of their 2015 mass by the end of the century for RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 
scenarios, respectively. Under the same scenarios, glaciers in North Asia would lose 57 ± 40%, 72 ± 38%, 
and 85 ± 30% of their mass, and glaciers in the Caucuses and the Middle East would lose 68 ± 32%, 
83 ± 19%, and 94 ± 13% of their mass (see also Kraaijenbrink et al., 2017; Rounce et al., 2020).  
 
Although enhanced melt water from snow and glaciers largely offsets hydrological drought-like conditions 
(Pritchard, 2019), this effect is unsustainable and may reverse as these cryospheric buffers disappear (Gan et 
al., 2015; Dong et al., 2018b; Huss and Hock, 2018) (medium confidence). In the Himalayas and the TIB 
region higher temperatures will lead to higher glacier melt rates and significant glacier shrinkage and a 
summer runoff decrease (Sorg et al., 2014) (medium confidence). Glacier runoff in the Asian high mountains 
will increase up to mid-century, and after that runoff might decrease due to the loss of glacier storage (Lutz 
et al., 2014; Huss and Hock, 2018; Rounce et al., 2020) (medium confidence).  
 
Compared with 1990s, the number of lakes in TIB in the 2010s decreased by 2%, whereas total lake area 
expanded by 25% (Wang et al., 2020a) due to the joint effect of precipitation increase and glacier retreat. 
Many new lakes are predicted to form as a consequence of continued glacier retreat in the Himalaya-
Karakoram region (Linsbauer et al., 2016). As many of these lakes will develop at the immediate foot of 
steep icy peaks with degrading permafrost and decreasing slope stability, the risk of glacier lake outburst 
floods and floods from landslides into moraine-dammed lakes is increasing in Asian high mountains 
(Haeberli et al., 2017b; Kapitsa et al., 2017; Bajracharya et al., 2018; Narama et al., 2018; Wang et al., 
2020a) (high confidence). 
 
*Permafrost:* Permafrost is thawing in Asia (high confidence). Temperatures in the cold continuous 
permafrost of northeastern ESB rose from the 1980s up to 2017, and the active layer thicknesses in Siberia 
and RFE generally increased from late 1990s to 2017 (Romanovsky et al., 2018). The change in mean annual 
ground temperature for north Siberia is about +0.1 – 0.3 °C per decade since 2000 (Romanovsky et al., 
2018). Ground temperature in the permafrost regions of TIB (taking 40% of TIB currently) increased 
(0.02~0.26°C per decade for different boreholes) during 1980 to 2018, and the active layer thickened at a 
rate of 19.5 cm per decade (Zhao et al., 2020b). There is high confidence that permafrost in Asian high 
mountains will continue to thaw and the active layer thickness will increase (Bolch et al., 2019). The 
permafrost area is projected to decline by 13.4–27.7% and 60–90% in TIB (Zhao et al., 2020b), and 
32% ± 11% and 76% ± 12% in Russia (Guo and Wang, 2016) by the end of the 21st century under the 
RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenario respectively (high confidence).  
 
*Lake and river ice:* Lake ice cover duration got shorter in many lakes in TIB (Yao et al., 2016; Cai et al., 
2019; Guo et al., 2020) and some other areas such as northwest China (Cai et al., 2020) and northeast China 
(Yang et al., 2019) in last two decades (high confidence). River ice cover extent decreased in TIB as well (Li 
et al., 2020d; Yang et al., 2020a). Climate warming also leads to a significant reduction in the period with ice 
phenomena and the decrement of ice regime hazard in Russian lowland rivers (Agafonova et al., 2017), and 
the Inner Mongolia reach of the Yellow River in north China (Wan et al., 2020) (high confidence). Lake ice 
and river ice in Asia are expected to decline with projected increases in surface air temperature towards the 
end of this century (Guo et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020a) (high confidence). 
 
*Heavy snowfall and ice storm:* Observed trends in heavy snowfall and ice storms are uncertain. Annual 
maximum snow depth decreased for the period between 1962 and 2016 on the western side of both eastern 
and western Japan, at rates of 12.3% and 14.6% per decade, respectively (Ministry of the Environment et al., 
2018). Observational results generally show a decrease in the frequency and an increase in the mean 
intensity of snowfalls in most Chinese regions (Zhou et al., 2018) (medium confidence). Because of the 
decrease in the snow frequency, the occurrence of large-scale snow disasters in TIB decreased (Qiu et al., 
2018; Wang et al., 2019d) (low confidence). Large parts of northern high-latitude continents (including 
Siberia and RFE) have experienced cold snaps and heavy snowfalls in the past few winters, and the reduction 
of Arctic sea ice would increase the chance of heavy snowfall events in those regions in coming decades 
(Song and Liu, 2017) (medium confidence). Heavy snowfall is projected to occur more frequently in Japan’s 
Northern Alps, the inland areas of Honshu Island and Hokkaido Island (Kawase et al., 2016, 2020; MOE et 
al., 2018), and the heavy wet snowfall can be enhanced over the mountainous regions in central Japan and 
northern part of Japan (Ohba and Sugimoto, 2020) (medium confidence).  
 
*Hail:* The hailstorm in the Asian region shows a decreasing trend in several regions (low confidence, limited 
evidence). In China severe weather days including thunderstorm, hail and/or damaging wind have decreased 
by 50% from 1961 to 2010 (Li et al., 2016b; Zhang et al., 2017), and the hail size decreased since 1980 (Ni 
et al., 2017). A rate of decrease of 0.214 hail days per decade has also been reported for Mongolia between 
1984-2013, where the annual number of hail days averaged is 0.74 (Lkhamjav et al., 2017).  
 
*Snow avalanche:* There is as yet limited evidence for the evolution of avalanches in Asia. Tree-ring–based 
snow avalanche reconstructions in the Indian Himalayas show an increase in avalanche occurrence and 
runout distances in recent decades (Ballesteros-Cánovas et al., 2018).  
 
*In summary, snowpack and glaciers are projected to continue decreasing and permafrost to continue 
thawing in Asia (high confidence). There is medium confidence of increasing heavy snowfall in some 
regions, but limited evidence on future changes in hail and snow avalanches.* 
 
 
### 12.4.2.5  Coastal and oceanic 
 
*Relative sea level:* Around Asia, over 1900-2018, a new tide-gauge based reconstruction finds a regional-
mean RSL change of 1.33 (0.80-1.86) mm yr<sup>-1</sup> in the Indian Ocean-Southern Pacific  and 1.68 [1.27 to 2.09] 
mm yr<sup>-1</sup> in the Northwest Pacific (Frederikse et al., 2020), compared to a GMSL change of around 1.7 mm 
yr<sup>-1</sup> (Section 2.3.3.3; Table 9.5). For the period 1993-2018, the RSLR rates, based on satellite altimetry, 
increased to 3.65 [3.23 to 4.08] mm yr<sup>-1</sup> and 3.53 [2.64 to 4.45] mm yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively (Frederikse et al., 
2020), compared to a GMSL change of 3.25 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> (Section 2.3.3.3; Table 9.5). The rate of RSL rise along 
the coastline of China ranges from -2.3 ± 1.9 to 5.7 ± 0.4 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> during 1980–2016; after removing the 
vertical land movement, the average rate of sea level rise is 2.9 ± 0.8 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> over 1980-2016 and 3.2 ± 1.1 
mm yr<sup>-1</sup> since 1993 (Qu et al., 2019). However, the rates of land subsidence reported by (Minderhoud et al., 
2017) are substantially higher than those reported by Qu et al. (2019). RSL change in many coastal areas in 
Asia, especially in EAS, is affected by land subsidence due to sediment compaction under building mass and 
groundwater extraction (Erban et al., 2014; Nicholls, 2015; Minderhoud et al., 2019; Qu et al., 2019) (high 
confidence). During 1991- 2016, the Mekong delta in Vietnam sank on average ~18 cm as a consequence of 
groundwater withdrawal, and the subsidence related to groundwater extraction has gradually increased with 
highest sinking rates estimated to be 11 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> in 2015 (Minderhoud et al., 2017). 
 
Relative sea-level rise is very likely to continue in the oceans around Asia. Regional-mean RSLR projections 
for the oceans around Asia range from 0.3 m–0.5 m under SSP1-RCP2.6 to 0.7 m–0.8 m under SSP5-
RCP8.5 for 2081-2100 relative to 1995-2014 (median values), which means local RSL change ranges from 
just below mean projected GMSL change to above-average values {Section 9.6.3.3}. These RSLR 
projections may however be underestimated due to potential partial representation of land subsidence in their 
assessment (Section 9.6.3.2).  

*Coastal flood:* The present day 1:100 yr ETWL is between 0.5 m – 8 m around Asia, with values above 2.5 
m or above common along the Central and North East coasts of Asia (Vousdoukas et al., 2018; Kirezci et al., 
2020). Sea level rise and land subsidence will jointly lead to more flooding in delta areas in Asia (Takagi et 
al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018a) (high confidence).  
 
Extreme total water level magnitude and occurrence frequency are expected to increase throughout the 
region (high confidence) (see Figure 12.4p-r and Figure SM 12.6). Across the region, the 5th – 95th percentile 
range of the 1:100 yr ETWL is projected to increase (relative to 1980 – 2014) by 7 cm – 44 cm and by 10 cm 
– 42 cm by 2050 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. By 2100, this range is projected to be 11 cm – 91 
cm and 28 cm – 187 cm under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively (Vousdoukas et al., 2018; Kirezci et al., 
2020). Furthermore, the present day 1:100 yr ETWL is projected to have median return periods of around 
1:50 yrs by 2050 and 1:10 yrs by 2100 under RCP in most of Asia, except SEA and ARP, in which the 
present day 1:100 yr ETWL is projected occur once per year or more, both by 2050 and 2100 (Vousdoukas 
et al., 2018). The present day 1:50 yr ETWL is projected to occur around 3 times a year by 2100 with a SLR 
of 1 m across Asia (Vitousek et al., 2017). Compound impacts of precipitation change, land subsidence, sea-
level rise, upstream hydropower development, and local water infrastructure development may lead to larger 
flood extent and prolonged inundation in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (Triet et al., 2020). 
 
*Coastal erosion:* Over the past 30 years, South, Southeast and East Asia exhibit the most pronounced delta 
changes globally due to strong human-induced changes to the fluvial sediment flux (Nienhuis et al., 2020). 
Satellite derived shoreline change estimates over 1984 – 2015 indicate shoreline retreat rates between 0.5 m 
yr<sup>-1</sup> and 1 m yr<sup>-1</sup> along the coasts of WCA and ARP, increasing to 3 m yr<sup>-1</sup> in SAS. Over the same period, 
shoreline progradation has been observed along the coasts of RFE (0.2 m yr<sup>-1</sup>), SEA (0.1 m yr<sup>-1</sup>) and EAS 
(0.5 m yr<sup>-1</sup>) (Luijendijk et al., 2018; Mentaschi et al., 2018 ). Meanwhile, there has been a gross coastal area 
loss of 3,590 km2  in South Asia, and a loss of 2,350 km2 in Pacific Asia, over a 30 year period (1984-2015) 
(Mentaschi et al., 2018).  
  
Projections indicate that a majority of sandy coasts in the Asia region will experience shoreline retreat (Udo 
and Takeda, 2017; Ritphring et al., 2018; Vousdoukas et al., 2020b) (high confidence), while parts of the 
RFE, EAS, SEA and WCA coastline are projected to prograde over the 21st century, if present ambient 
shoreline change trends continue. Median shoreline change projections (CMIP5), relative to 2010, presented 
by Vousdoukas et al. (2020) show that, by mid-century, sandy shorelines in Asia will retreat by between 10 
m – 50 m, except in SAS where shoreline retreat is projected to exceed 100 m, under both RCP4.5 and 
RCP8.5. By 2100, and under RCP4.5, shoreline retreats of around 85 m, 100 m and 300 m are projected 
along the sandy coastlines of SEA and WCA, ARP and SAS respectively (50 m or less in other Asian 
regions), while under RCP8.5, over the same period, sandy shorelines along all regions with coastlines, 
except RFE and EAS, are projected to retreat by more than 100 m, with the retreat in SAS reaching 350 m 
(2100 RCP8.5 projections for RFE and EAS are ~ 60 m and ~ 85 m respectively) (see Figure 12.6).  
 
*Marine heatwave:* There have been frequent marine heatwaves (MHW) in the coastal oceans of Asia, 
connected to the increase between 0.25°C and 1°C in mean SST of the coastal oceans since 1982-1998 
(Oliver et al., 2018). There is high confidence that MHWs will increase around most of Asia. Mean SST is 
projected to increase by 1ºC (2ºC) around Asia by 2100, with a hotspot of around 2 ºC (5 ºC) along the 
coastlines of the East Sea and the RFE under RCP4.5 (RCP8.5) (see Interactive Atlas). Under global 
warming conditions, MHW intensity and duration are projected to increase in the coastal zones of all sub-
regions of Asia, but most notably in SEA and SAS (Frölicher et al., 2018). Projections for SSP1-2.6 and 
SSP5-8.5 both show an increase in MHWs around Asia by 2081 – 2100, relative to 1985 – 2014 (Box 9.2, 
Figure 1). 
  
*In general, there is high confidence that most coastal/ocean related hazards in Asia will increase over 
the 21st century. Relative sea-level rise is very likely to continue around Asia contributing to increased 
coastal flooding in low-lying areas (high confidence) and shoreline retreat along most sandy coasts 
(high confidence). Marine heatwaves are also expected to increase around the region over the 21st 
century (high confidence).* 
 
The assessed direction of change in climatic impact-drivers for Asia and associated confidence levels are

## 12.4.3  Australasia 
 
For the purpose of this assessment, Australasia is sub-divided into five sub-regions as defined in Section 
1.4.5: Northern Australia (NAU), Central Australia (CAU), Eastern Australia (EAU), Southern Australia 
(SAU) and New Zealand (NZ). 
 
Previous IPCC Assessment reports 4 and 5 identify the most damaging historical hazards in this region to be 
inland flooding, drought, wildfire, and episodic coastal erosion due to storms (Hennessy et al., 2007; 
Reisinger et al., 2014). The IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C warming (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018) projects 
very likely increases in the intensity and frequency of warm days and warm nights and decreases in the 
intensity and frequency of cold days and cold nights in Australasia. Furthermore, a likely increase in the 
frequency and duration of warm spells is also projected for Australia. The IPCC Special Report on the Ocean 
and Cryosphere (IPCC, 2019) projects a likely global mean sea level rise (RCP8.5) that is up to 0.1 m higher 
than corresponding AR5 projections. IPCC SROCC also projects an increase of mean significant wave 
height across the Southern Ocean (high confidence) and an increase in the occurrence of historically rare 
(1:100 yr) extreme sea levels to 1:1 yr or more frequent events all around the Australasian region by 2100 
under RCP8.5. 
 
A detailed national scale climate change assessment of observed and projected climate change, based on over 
40 CMIP5 models and high resolution downscaling (CSIRO and BOM, 2015) and bi-annual short updates  
thereafter are available for Australia (CSIRO and BOM, 2016, 2018, 2020). Similar national assessments for 
New Zealand are also available (Ministry for the Environment & Stats NZ (2017), Ministry for the 
Environment (2018) and Ministry for the Environment (2020)). The severe extreme events such as heat 
waves and river floods that have occurred in Australasia, especially over the last decade, have enabled a 
number of attribution studies, improving the understanding of regional climate change mechanisms that drive 
such extreme events (see Chapter 11). 
 
Figure 12.7 illustrates projected changes in two selected hazard indices for Australasia.

### 12.4.3.1  Heat and Cold 
 
*Mean air temperature:* Across Australia mean temperatures have increased by 1.44±0.24 °C during the 
period 1910-2019, with most of the warming occurring since 1950 (Section Atlas.6.2; CSIRO and BOM, 
2020; Trewin et al., 2020). In New Zealand, an increase of 1.1°C has been measured from 1909-2016 
(Section Atlas.6.2; Ministry for the Environment, 2020). In the period 1980 – 2014 a rate of increase of 0.1º 
– 0.3º per decade has been observed (Figure Atlas.11 and Figure Atlas.23). 
 
Mean temperature in Australasia is projected to continue to rise through the 21st century (virtually certain) 
(Section Atlas.6.4). Projections for Australia indicate that the average temperature will increase by +1.1°C 
(0.84-1.52°C 10th -90th percentile range) by 2041-2060 (mid-century), and by +1.9°C (1.29 to 2.58°C) by 
2081-2100 (end-century), relative to the baseline period of 1995-2014, under SSP2-4.5 (Interactive Atlas). 
For SSP5-8.5, the projected changes are up to +1.5°C (1.17 to 1.96°C) and +3.7°C (2.75 to 4.91°C) for mid 
and end century respectively. For SSP1-2.6, mean temperature is projected to rise by +0.9°C (0.55 to 1.26 
°C) and +1.0°C (0.55 to 1.54 °C) relative to 1995-2014 by mid and end century, respectively (Interactive 
Atlas). In New Zealand, an increase of mean temperature of +1.0°C (0.60-1.32°C) relative to 1995-2014 is 
projected by mid-century, and an increase of +1.6°C (1.03 to 2.26°C) by end century under SSP2-4.5. For 
SSP5-8.5, the projected increase in mean temperature is +1.3°C (0.91 to 1.66°C) and +3.1°C (2.20 to 4.05°C 
10-90 percentile range) relative to 1995-2014 by mid and end century, respectively. For SSP1-2.6, the 
projected increase in mean temperature is +0.75°C (0.39 to 1.06°C) and +0.8°C (0.47 to 1.46°C) relative to 
1995-2014 by mid and end century, respectively (Interactive Atlas). 
 
*Extreme heat:* The region has a very likely trend of increasing frequency and severity of hot extremes since 
the 1950s (Table 11.6). Extreme minimum temperatures have increased in all seasons over most of Australia 
and exceeds the increase in extreme maximum temperatures (Wang et al., 2013b; Jakob and Walland, 2016). 
Heatwave characteristics and hot extremes have increased across many Australian regions since the mid-20th 
century (Table 11.6; BOM and CSIRO, 2020)). The number of days per year with maximum temperature 
greater than 35°C has increased over most parts of Australia from 1957 – 2015, with the largest increasing 
trends of 0.4-1 days/year occurring in north western, northern, north eastern and parts of central Australia 
(CSIRO and BOM, 2016). Long term changes of hot extremes in Australia have been attributed to 
anthropogenic influence (Table 11.6). In New Zealand, the number of annual heatwave days increased at 18 
of 30 sites during the period 1972–2019 (MfE and Stats NZ, 2020). 
 
More frequent hot extremes and heatwaves are expected over the 21st century in Australia (virtually certain) 
(Table 11.6). Heat thresholds potentially affecting agriculture and health, such as 35°C or 40°C, are also 
projected to be exceeded more frequently over the 21st century in Australia under all RCPs (high confidence). 
By 2090 under RCP4.5, the average number of days per year with maximum temperatures above 35°C is 
highly spatially variable and is expected to increase by 50%–100%, while the number of days per year with 
maximum temperatures above 40°C is expected to increase by 200%, relative to 1985  2005 (CSIRO and 
BOM, 2015). Under RCP8.5 the corresponding projected increases are even greater, with a greater than 
100% increase in most of Australia, and far greater increases (up to a 20-fold increase in Darwin) in central 
and northern Australia. Projections for NZ indicate more frequent hot extremes (virtually certain) (Table 
11.6). Figure 12.4b, c shows CMIP6 projections of mean number of days per year with maximum 
temperature exceeding 35°C under SSP5-8.5, which are consistent with the above assessed literature and 
across the two CMIP generations, and indicate a strong difference depending on the mitigation scenario (e.g. 
over 100 days more per year under SSP5-8.5 in NAU, but, in general, less than 60 days more per year under 
SSP1-2.6 in NAU) (see also Figure SM 12.1) 
 
The projected frequency of exceeding dangerous humid heat thresholds is increasing in Australia, with a 
strong increase in Northern Australia for RCP8.5 (high confidence) (Zhao et al., 2015; Mora et al., 2017; 
Brouillet and Joussaume, 2019), consistently across CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX simulations (Figure 
12.4d-f and Figure SM 12.2). Using the HI index, by end-century, the average number of days exceeding 
41°C is projected to increase in NAU by about 100 days and by about 25 days under SSP5-8.5 and SSP1-
2.6, respectively. The projections for New Zealand indicate no appreciable increase in the number of days 
with HI > 41°C across SSPs, time periods and CMIP generations (Figure 12.4d-f and Figure SM 12.2). 
 
*Cold spell and frost:* Excepting parts of southern Australia, the Australasian region has a significant trend of 
decreasing frequency in cold extremes since the 1950s (high confidence) (Table 11.6) and there is high 
confidence that such trends are attributable to anthropogenic influence (Table 11.6). The number of frost 
days per year in Australia has on average declined at a rate of 0.15 days/decade in the past century 
(Alexander and Arblaster, 2017), except in some regions of southern Australia, where an increase in both 
number and season length has been reported (Dittus et al., 2014; Crimp et al., 2016b).  The number of frost 
days has decreased at 12 of 30 monitoring sites around New Zealand over the period 1972–2019 (MfE and 
Stats NZ, 2020).  
 
Less frequent cold extremes are virtually certain in Australasia (Table 11.6) while a decrease of frost days is 
projected with high confidence for the region. Projections, relative to 1986–2005, for the number of frost 
days per year in Australia indicate declines of 0.9 days by mid-century and 1.1 days by end of the century for 
RCP4.5, while for RCP8.5, the projected declines are 1.0 days and 1.3 days by mid- and end century 
respectively (Alexander and Arblaster, 2017; Herold et al., 2018). Projections for New Zealand indicate that 
the number of frost days will decrease by 30% (RCP2.6) to 50% (RCP8.5) by 2040, relative to 1986–2005. 
By 2090, the decrease ranges from 30% (RCP2.6) to 90% (RCP8.5) (MfE and Stats NZ, 2017).  
 
*In general, there is high confidence that most heat hazards in Australasia will increase and that cold 
hazards will decrease over the 21st century. The mean temperature in Australasia is virtually certain to 
continue to rise through the 21st century, accompanied by less frequent cold extremes (virtually 
certain) and frost days (high confidence), and more frequent hot extremes (virtually certain). Heat 
stress is projected to increase in Australia (high confidence).*  
 

### 12.4.3.2  Wet and Dry 
 
*Mean precipitation:* Here, only increases in precipitation (under Wet) are addressed, with decreases (under 
Dry) are addressed in Aridity below. 
 
In terms of wet climatic impact-drivers, detectable anthropogenic increases in precipitation in Australia have 
been reported particularly for north central Australia for the period 1901-2010 (Knutson and Zeng, 2018). 
Figure Atlas.11 indicates no significant trend in precipitation over the region during the baseline period 1960 
– 2015, except for the GPCP dataset which shows an increasing trend in north central Australia. In New 
Zealand, increases in annual rainfall have been observed between 1960-2019 in the south and west of the 
South Island and east of the North Island. Note however, for the most part, the above reported trends in New 
Zealand have been classified as statistically not significant (Figure Atlas.23).  
 
Annual mean precipitation is projected to increase in central and north east Australia (low confidence) and in 
the south and west of New Zealand (medium confidence) (Section Atlas.6.4). Liu et al. (2018a) show that 
under 1.5°C warming, central and northeast Australia will become wetter. In New Zealand, projected 
patterns in annual precipitation exhibit increases in the west and south of New Zealand (Section 
Atlas.6.4).(Liu et al., 2018a) project that the South Island will be wetter under both 1.5°C and 2°C warming. 
However, there is limited model agreement for projected rainfall changes in Australasia as shown in the 
Atlas.   
 
*River flood:* Streamflow observations in Australia have shown that negative trends dominate in annual 
maximum flow and that stations with significant negative trends were mostly located in the southeast and 
southwest (Gu et al., 2020). The observed peak flow trend in southern Australia is attributed to the decrease 
of soil moisture, although an increase of flood magnitude is possible for very rare events. For the more 
frequent flood events, the increase of extreme precipitation is balanced by the decrease of soil moisture. 
(Wasko and Nathan, 2019).  
 
While median annual runoff is projected to decrease in most of Australia (Chiew et al., 2017), consistent 
with projected decreases in average rainfall (CSIRO and BOM, 2015; Alexander and Arblaster, 2017), river 
floods are projected to increase due to more intense extreme rainfall events and associated increase in runoff 
(medium confidence). Asadieh and Krakauer (2017) found a decrease in the value of the 95% percentile of 
mean streamflow with RCP8.5 by the end of the century in all of Australia, except in a small part in centre of 
the country. In terms of relative increases, flooding is expected to increase more in the northern Australia 
(driven by convective rainfall systems) than in southern Australia (where more intense extreme rainfall may 
be compensated by drier antecedent moisture conditions) (Alexander and Arblaster, 2017; Dey et al., 2019) 
with flood frequency increasing in northern Australia and along parts of the east coast and decreasing in 
south-western Western Australia (Hirabayashi et al. 2013). Gu et al. (2020) project larger flood magnitude 
and volumes under both RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 in northern Australia, and smaller flood magnitudes and 
volumes in southern Australia under the same RCPs. These findings are in general agreement with the 
patterns in peak flow, corresponding to the 1:100 yr return period streamflow, shown in Figure 12.7a,c for 
mid-21st century under RCP8.5. 
 
There is medium confidence that river flooding will increase in New Zealand. Projections for New Zealand 
indicate that the 1:50 yr and 1:100 yr flood peaks for rivers in many parts of the country may increase by 5 to 
10% by 2050 and more by 2100 (with large variation between models and emissions scenarios), with a 
corresponding decrease in return periods for specific flood levels (Gray et al., 2005; Carey-Smith et al., 
2010; McMillan et al., 2010, 2012; Ballinger et al., 2011).  
 
*Heavy precipitation and pluvial flood:* Rainfall extremes have been detected to increase in Australasia, 
with low confidence (Table 11.6).  There is high confidence that Rx1day and Rx5day precipitation extremes 
will increase for 2ºC or lower warming for the region as a whole, but on a sub-regional basis there is only 
medium confidence of increases in NAU and CAU and low confidence of increases on EAU, SAU and NZ. 
For warming levels exceeding 2ºC, these extremes are very likely to increase in NAU and CAU and they are 
likely to increase elsewhere in the region (Section 11.9).  
 
*Landslide:* Based on local slope characteristics, lithology and seismic activity, the South Island and the 
eastern half of the North Island of New Zealand are vulnerable to landslide occurrence (Broeckx et al., 
2020). The potential for land and rockslides increases with, amongst other factors, total precipitation rates, 
precipitation intensity, mountain permafrost thaw rates, glacier retreat and air temperature (Allen and 
Huggel, 2013; Crozier, 2010; Gariano and Guzzetti, 2016; IPCC, 2019). Given the increase of the magnitude 
of these physical variables in areas that are already highly susceptible to mass movements (MfE, 2018), there 
is low confidence that the occurrence of landslides will increase under future climate conditions.  
 
*Aridity:* In terms of dry climatic impact-drivers, a substantial decrease in precipitation has been observed 
across southern Australia during the cool season (April–October) (medium confidence). The drying trend has 
been particularly strong over southwest Western Australia between May and July, with rainfall since 1970 
being around 20% less than the 1900-1969 average (CSIRO and BOM, 2020). Detectable decreases in mean 
precipitation, attributable at least in part to anthropogenic forcing, have been reported for parts of southwest 
Australia (Delworth and Zeng, 2014; Knutson and Zeng, 2018), southeast Australia, and Tasmania (Knutson 
and Zeng, 2018; see also case study in Section 10.4.1.2.3). In New Zealand, the northeast of the South Island 
and western and the northern parts of the North Island show decreasing precipitation trends during 1960-
2019 (MfE and Stats NZ, 2020). 
 
Aridity is projected to increase, especially during winter and spring, with medium confidence in SAU but 
with high confidence in southwest Western Australia (Section Atlas.6.4, Table 11.6). In EAU and in the 
north and east of NZ, aridity is projected to increase with medium confidence, while a decrease is projected 
with medium confidence in the south and west of NZ (Section Atlas.6.4). Although there is only low 
confidence in the projected decrease of mean annual precipitation in south western and eastern Australia and 
the north and east of New Zealand, there is high confidence of reduced winter and spring precipitation in 
Australia in future, mostly in southwestern and eastern Australia (Section Atlas.6.4). Liu et al. (2018b) show 
that under 2°C warming, most of Australia is projected to become drier based on PDSI, with the exception of 
the tropical northeast. Ferguson et al. (2018) project that between 1976-2005 and 2070-2099, winters will 
become drier (mainly in southern Australia) under RCP8.5. (Liu et al., 2018c) project that the north island of 
New Zealand will be drier under both 1.5°C and 2°C warming. 
 
*Hydrological Drought:* There is low confidence of observed changes in hydrological droughts in 
Australasia, except in SAU where there is medium comfidence of an observed increase in the south-east and 
south-west. Future projections indicate medium confidence in further hydrological drought increases for 
Southern Australia for warming levels of 2°C or higher (Section 11.9). Mean annual runoff in far south-east 
and far south-west Australia are projected to decline by median values of 20% and 50%, respectively, by 
mid-century under RCP8.5 (Chiew et al., 2017). Prudhomme et al. (2014) assess changes in the Drought 
Index (DI), defined as areal runoff less than the 10th percentile over the reference period 1976 – 2005, and 
project DI increases for both Australia and New Zealand by 10%–20% by 2070-2099 under RCP8.5 with the 
greatest effects being in the southern parts of the Australian continent.  Those projections are consistent with 
the trends shown in Figure 12.4g-i (see also Figure SM 12.3). The SPI drought frequency is projected to 
increase in SAU and particularly in southwest Western Australia by mid- century, while by the end of the 
century SPI drought frequency is projected to increase all over Australia, and particularly strongly in 
southwest Western Australia as well as southern Victoria (see Figure 12.4g-i). For the Murray-Darling basin, 
Ferguson et al. (2018) project effectively no change (-1%) in mean precipitation, a 27% decrease in P-E, and 
30% increase in runoff in 2070-2099 relative to 1976-2005 with RCP8.5.  
 
*Agricultural and ecological Drought:* There is medium confidence in observations of Agricultural and 
ecological droughts increasing in SAU and decreasing in NAU, while there is low confidence of changes 
elsewhere in the region (Section 11.9).  More regional studies have observed an increase in agricultural and 
ecological drought intensity in southwest Australia and an increase in drought intensity in parts of southeast 
Australia, while the length of droughts therein has increased (Section 11.9). In New Zealand, since 1972/73, 
soils at 7 of 30 monitored sites became drier, while the 2012–13 drought was one of the most extreme in the 
previous 41 years (MfE and Stats NZ, 2017). Future evaporative demand is projected to lead to medium 
confidence increases in agricultural and ecological droughts for a 2° global warming level in SAU and EAU 
and low confidence for changes in CAU, NAU and NZ although there is medium confidence of CAU 
increases at the 4℃ global warming level (Section 11.9). There is medium confidence for more time in 
agricultural and ecological drought in SAU by mid-21st century (Coppola et al., 2021b) as well as by the end 
of the 21st century (Herold et al., 2018). The SPEI shows a springtime intensification in SAU with moderate 
and severe droughts in the southwest and moderate droughts in the southeast (Herold et al., 2018). There is 
consensus among the different model ensembles (CORDEX-CORE, CMIP5 and CMIP6) that the drought 
frequency (DF), one of several proxies for agricultural and ecological drought, will increase in all four 
Australian regions for both mid-century (NAU 0.2 to 2 DF increase, CEU 0.5 to 2 DF increase, SAU 1 to 3 
DF increase and EAU 0.8 to 3 DF increase) and end-century (0.8–2.7 DF increase for NAU, 1.2–2 DF 
increase for CAU, 2.2–3.8 for SAU, and 0.2–3 for EAU) for both RCP8.5 and SSP5-85, with CMIP6 
showing the lowest increase (see Figure 12.4g-l and Figure SM 12.4) (Coppola et al., 2021b). 
 
*Fire weather:* Dowdy and Pepler (2018) examined atmospheric conditions conducive to pyroconvection in 
the period 1979-2016, and found an increased risk in southeast Australia during spring and summer, due to 
changes in vertical atmospheric stability and humidity, in combination with adverse near-surface fire weather 
conditions. CSIRO and BOM (2018) and Dowdy (2018) found that the annual 90th percentile daily Forest 
Fire Danger Index (FFDI) has increased from 1950-2016 in parts of Australia, especially in southern 
Australia (1 to 2.5 decade-1) and in spring and summer. These studies indicate an increase in the frequency 
and magnitude of FFDI extreme quantiles, as well as a shift of the fire season start toward spring, 
lengthening the fire season. The unprecedented large fires of austral spring and summer of 2019 in SE 
Australia were a result of extreme hot and dry weather in significantly drier than average conditions that had 
persisted since 2017, in combination with consistently stronger than average winds, resulting in above 
average to highest on record FFDI values in much of the country (Abram et al., 2021). These fires have been 
attributed to climate change through the temperature component of fire weather indices (van Oldenborgh et 
al., 2021). In New Zealand, days with very high and extreme fire weather increased in 12 out of 28 
monitored sites, and decreased in 8, in the period 1997 to 2019 (MfE and Stats NZ, 2020). Attribution 
studies indicate that there is medium confidence of an anthropogenically-driven past increase in fire weather 
conditions, essentially due to increase in frequency of extreme heat waves. (Hope et al., 2019; Lewis et al., 
2020; van Oldenborgh et al., 2021). 
 
Fire weather indices are projected to increase in most of Australia (high confidence) and many parts of New 
Zealand (medium confidence), in particular with respect to extreme fire and induced pyroconvection (Dowdy 
et al., 2019b). Increasing mean temperature, cool season rainfall decline, and changes in tropical climate 
variability all contribute to a future increase in extreme fire risk in Australia (Abram et al., 2021). Projections 
indicate that the annual cumulative FFDI will increase by 31-33% in southern and eastern Australia, and by 
17-25% in northern Australia and the Rangelands by 2090 (relative to 1995) under RCP8.5 (CSIRO and 
BOM, 2015). Using a CMIP5 ensemble of 17 models, Abatzoglou et al. (2019) found a statistically 
significant positive trend for fire weather intensity and fire season length for future mid-century conditions 
under RCP8.5, including a detectable anthropogenic influence on fire risk magnitude and fire season length 
by 2040 in Western Australia and along the Queensland coastline. Using the C-Haines and FFDI indices 
with A2 and RCP8.5 respectively, Di Virgilio et al. (2019) and Clarke et al. (2019) have shown that extreme 
fire weather frequency will increase in south eastern Australia by the end of the 21st century. Most of these 
projections indicate that the biggest increases in fire weather conditions will be in late spring, effectively 
resulting in longer (stronger) fire seasons in areas where spring is the shoulder (peak) season. 

In New Zealand, Watt et al. (2019) projected that the number of days with very high to extreme fire risk will 
increase by 71 per cent by 2040, and by a further 12 per cent by 2090, for the A1B scenario, with fire risk increase 
all along the east coast. The most marked relative changes by 2090 were projected for Wellington and Dunedin 
where very high to extreme fire risk is projected to increase by, respectively, 89% to 32 days and 207% to 18 
days, compared to the baseline period 1970-1999. 
 
*Annual mean precipitation is projected to increase in central and north east Australia (low confidence) 
and in the south and west of New Zealand (medium confidence), while it is projected to decrease in 
southern Australia (medium confidence), albeit with high confidence in southwest western Australia, in 
eastern Australia (medium confidence), and in the north and east of New Zealand (medium confidence). 
Heavy precipitation and pluvial flooding are projected to increase with medium confidence in northern 
Australia and central Australia. There is medium confidence that river flooding will increase in New 
Zealand and Australia, with higher increases in northern Australia. Aridity is projected to increase 
with medium confidence in southern Australia (high confidence in southwest Western Australia), 
eastern Australia (medium confidence), and in the north and east of New Zealand (medium confidence). 
Hydrological droughts are projected to increase in Southern Australia (medium confidence), while 
Agricultural and ecological droughts are projected to increase with medium confidence in Southern 
Australia and Eastern Australia. Fire weather is projected to increase throughout Australia (high 
confidence) and New Zealand (medium confidence).* 
 
 
### 12.4.3.3  Wind  
 
*Mean wind speed:* There is low confidence of a mean wind-speed trend in the last decades (low agreement) 
(McVicar et al., 2012; Troccoli et al., 2012; Azorin-Molina et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018b), as long-term 
measurements are not homogeneous.  
 
In future climate scenarios wind speed trends exhibit generally weak amplitudes with low agreement among 
models (Figure 12.4m-o and Figure SM 12.5) in Australia with uncertain consequences on wind power 
potential (CSIRO and BOM, 2015; Karnauskas et al., 2018a; Jung and Schindler, 2019). However, there is 
medium confidence that, by the end of the century, annual mean wind power will significantly increase in 
northeastern Australia under RCP8.5, but there is low confidence of an increase by end-century under 
RCP4.5, and for any scenario by mid-century (Karnauskas et al., 2018). In New Zealand, mean wind patterns 
are projected to become more north-easterly in summer, and westerlies to become more intense in winter 
(low confidence), in agreement with the strengthening of the southern hemisphere storm tracks (Section 
4.5.1). 
 
*Severe wind storm:* There is generally low confidence in observed changes in extreme winds and 
extratropical storms in Australasia (Section 11.7.2). CMIP5 projections of severe winds indicate a general 
increase in north eastern Australia, and decrease in some parts in southern and central Australia (medium 
confidence) by the end of the century under RCP8.5 (CSIRO and BOM, 2015; Kumar et al., 2015; Jung and 
Schindler, 2019). Elsewhere trends are diverse and vary across simulations with low agreement. Projections 
of changes in the 1:25 yr return period winds (based on annual maxima) for 2074–2100 relative to 1979–
2005 for RCP8.5 show an increase in tropical areas of northern Australia (Kumar et al., 2015). 
 
In New Zealand, the frequency and magnitude of extreme wind have decreased (from 1980 – 2019) at 12 of 
14 monitored sites and increased at two monitored sites (MfE and Stats NZ, 2020). Due to the intensification 
and the shift of the Austral storm track by the end of the century (Yin, 2005), a continuous increase in 
extreme wind speed in New Zealand is projected over the South Island and the southern part of the North 
Island by mid- and end of century for all RCP’s (low confidence) (MfE, 2018). 
 
*Tropical cyclone:* In Australia, the number of TCs has generally declined since 1982, and the frequency of 
intense TCs that make landfall in north eastern Australia has declined significantly since the 19th century 
(medium confidence) (Kuleshov et al., 2010; Callaghan and Power, 2011; Holland and Bruyère, 2014; 
Knutson et al., 2019; CSIRO and BOM, 2020). There is high confidence that cyclones making landfall along 
north eastern and north Australian coastlines will decrease in number and low confidence of an increase in 
their intensities for a 2°C global warming level as well as for the mid-century period with scenarios RCP4.5 
and above (Roberts et al., 2015, 2020; Bacmeister et al., 2018; Knutson et al., 2020) , with the amplitude of 
changes increasing from RCP4.5 to RCP8.5 (Bacmeister et al., 2018). Decreases in frequency are projected 
for “east coast lows” (Walsh et al., 2016b; Dowdy et al., 2019a). 
 
Sand and dust storm: Australia is recognized to be the largest dust source in the Southern Hemisphere 
(Zheng et al., 2016). Land use and land cover change have increase dust emissions in Australia in the past 
200 years (Marx et al., 2014). While projections suggest a decrease in severe winds in central and southern 
Australia, changes in vegetation due to increased aridity and hydrological drought could be expected to result 
in increased wind erosion and dust emission across the country (medium confidence) (Webb et al., 2020). 
 
*In Australasia, there is low confidence in projected mean wind speeds and wind power potential, with 
a medium confidence increase projected only in northeastern Australia under high emission scenarios 
and by the end of the 21st century. Tropical cyclones in north eastern and north Australia are 
projected to decrease in number (high confidence) while their intensity is projected to increase (low 
confidence).* 
 
 
### 12.4.3.4  Snow and Ice 
 
*Snow:* The snow season length in Australia has decreased by 5% during 2000-2013 relative to 1954-1999, 
especially in spring (Pepler et al., 2015). A shift in the date of peak snowfall has also been observed with an 
11 day advance over the same period (Pepler et al., 2015). A decreasing trend in maximum snow depth has 
been observed for Australian alpine regions since the late 1950s, with the largest declines during spring and 
at lower altitudes. Maximum snow depth is highly variable and is strongly influenced by rare heavy snowfall 
days, which have no observed trends in frequency (CSIRO and BOM, 2020).  
 
Projections for Southern Australia and New Zealand show a continuing reduction in snowfall during the 21st 
century (high confidence). The magnitude of decrease varies with the altitude of the region and the emission 
scenario. At elevations lower than 1500 m, years without snowfall are projected from 2030 in some models. 
By 2090, and under RCP8.5, such years are projected to become common (CSIRO and BOM, 2015). The 
number of annual snow days in New Zealand is projected to decrease under all RCP’s, by up to 30 days or 
more by 2090 under RCP8.5, relative to 1986 – 2005 (MfE, 2018). 
 
*Glacier:* Glacier mass and areal extent in New Zealand is projected to continue to decease over the 21st 
century (high confidence) (Section 9.5.1.3). Glacier ice volume from 1977 to 2018 in New Zealand has 
decreased from 26.6 km3 to 17.9 km3 (a loss of 33%) (Salinger et al., 2019). Relative to 2015, glaciers in 
New Zealand are projected to lose 36 ± 44%, 53 ± 33%, and 77 ± 27% of their mass by the end of the century 
under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, respectively, with the loss rates decreasing over time under RCP2.6 
and increasing under RCP8.5 (Marzeion et al., 2020).  
 
*In summary, snowfall is expected to decrease throughout the region at high altitudes in both Australia 
(high confidence) and New Zealand (medium confidence). In New Zealand, glacier ice mass and extent 
are expected to decrease over the 21st century for all scenarios (high confidence).* 

 

### 12.4.3.5  Coastal and Oceanic 
 
*Relative sea level:* Around Australasia, over 1900-2018, a new tide-gauge based reconstruction finds a 
regional-mean RSL change of 1.33 [0.80-1.86] mm yr<sup>-1</sup>  in the Indian ocean - South Pacific region (Frederikse 
et al., 2020), compared to a GMSL change of around 1.7 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> (Section 2.3.3.3; Table 9.5). For the period 
1993-2018, the RSLR rates, based on satellite altimetry, increased to 3.65 [3.23-4.08] mm yr<sup>-1</sup> (Frederikse et 
al., 2020), compared to a GMSL change of 3.25 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> (Section 2.3.3.3; Table 9.5). 

Relative sea level is virtually certain to increase throughout the region over the 21st century (Section 9.6.3, 
Figure 9.28). Regional-mean RSLR projections for the oceans around Australasia range from 0.4 m–0.5 m 
under SSP1-RCP2.6 to 0.7 m–0.9 m under SSP5-RCP8.5 for 2081-2100 relative to 1995-2014 (median 
values), which means local RSL change falls within the range of mean projected GMSL change (Section 
9.6.3.3). However these RSLR projections may be underestimated due to potential partial representation of 
land subsidence (Section 9.6.3.2).  
 
*Coastal flood:* The most commonly used index for episodic coastal inundation in Australia is the summation 
of a high end SLR and the 1:100 yr storm tide level (the combined sea level due to storm surge and tide) 
(CSIRO and BOM, 2016; McInnes et al., 2016). However, episodic coastal flooding is caused by Extreme 
Total Water Levels (ETWL), which is the combination of SLR, tides, surge and wave setup (12.3.5.2). The 
present day 1:100 yr ETWL is between 0.5 m – 2.5 m around most of Australia, except the northwestern 
coast where 1:100 yr ETWL can be as large as 6 m–7 m (Vousdoukas et al., 2018; O’Grady et al., 2019; 
Kirezci et al., 2020). 

Extreme total water level magnitude and occurrence frequency are expected to increase throughout the 
region (high confidence) (see Figure 12.4p-r and Figure SM 12.6). Across the region, the 5th – 95th percentile 
range of the 1:100 yr ETWL is projected increase (relative to 1980 – 2014) by 5 cm – 35 cm and by 10 cm – 
40 cm by 2050 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively (Figure 12.4q). By 2100 (Figure 12.4p,r), this range 
is projected to be 25 cm – 80 cm and 50 cm – 190 cm under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively (Vousdoukas 
et al., 2018; Kirezci et al., 2020). Furthermore, the present day 1:100 yr ETWL is projected to have median 
return periods of around 1:20 yrs by 2050 and 1:1 yrs  by 2100 in SAU and NZ and return periods of around 
1:50 yrs  by 2050 and 1:20 yrs  by 2100 in NAU under RCP4.5 (Vousdoukas et al., 2018), while the present 
day 1:50 yr ETWL is projected to occur around 3 times a year by 2100 with a SLR of 1 m around Australasia 
(Vitousek et al., 2017).  
 
*Coastal erosion:* Satellite derived shoreline retreat rates for the period between 1984 – 2015 show retreat 
rates between 0.5 m yr<sup>-1</sup> and 1 m yr<sup>-1</sup> around the region, except in SAU where a shoreline progradation rate 
of 0.1 m yr<sup>-1</sup> has been observed (Luijendijk et al., 2018; Mentaschi et al., 2018). Mentaschi et al. (2018) 
report a coastal area loss of 350 km2 over the same period in West Australia from satellite observations.  
 
Projections indicate that a majority of sandy coasts in the region will experience shoreline retreat, throughout 
the 21st century (high confidence) (Figure 12.7b,d). Median shoreline change projections (CMIP5) under 
both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 presented by Vousdoukas et al. (2020) show that, by mid-century, sandy shorelines 
will retreat (relative to 2010) by between 50 m and 80 m all around Australasia, except in SAU and NZ 
where the projected retreat (relative to 2010) is between 35 m and 50 m. By 2100, median shoreline retreats 
exceeding 100 m (relative to 2010) are projected along the sandy coasts of NAU (~ 150 m), CAU ( ~ 160 m), 
and EAU ( ~ 110 m) under RCP4.5m, while projections for SAU and NZ are around 80 m – 90 m. Under 
RCP8.5, shoreline retreat exceeding 100 m is projected all around the region by 2100 (relative to 2010) with 
retreats as high as 220 m in NAU and CAU (~ 170 m in EAU and around 130 m in SAU and NZ) (Figure 
12.7b, d). The total length of sandy coasts in Australasia that is projected to retreat by more than a median of 
100 m by 2100 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 is about 12,500 km and 16,000 km respectively, an increase of 
approximately 30%. 
 
Distinct from long term coastline recession, storms and storm surges also result in episodic coastal erosion. 
In general, the historically measured maximum episodic coastal erosion (either eroded volume or coastline 
retreat distance) or that due to a 1:100 yr return period storm wave height is used as a design criterion for 
coastal zone management and planning in Australia (Wainwright et al., 2014; Mortlock et al., 2017). 
 
While there is wide recognition in Australia that the combined effect of SLR, changing storm surge and 
wave climates will directly affect future episodic coastal erosion (Harley et al., 2017; McInnes et al., 2016; 
Ranasinghe, 2016) only a few projections of how this hazard may evolve are available for Australia. In one 
such study, Jongejan et al. (2016) provide projections of how the full exceedance probability curve of the 
maximum erosion per year may evolve over the 21st century (due to the combined action of SLR, storm 
surge and storm waves). Their results show that, for example, the 0.01 exceedance probability maximum 
coastline retreat in 2025 will have an exceedance probability of 0.015 by 2050 and 0.07 by 2100. 
 
*Marine heatwave:* The mean SST of the ocean around Australia and east of New Zealand has warmed at a 
rate of about 0.22ºC per decade between 1992 and 2016 (Wijffels et al., 2018), which is higher than the 
global average SST increase of 0.16ºC per decade (Oliver et al., 2018). This mean ocean surface warming is 
connected to longer and more frequent marine heatwaves in the region (Oliver et al., 2018). Over the period 
1982-2016, the coastal ocean of Australia experienced on average more than 1.5 MHW per year, with the 
north coast of Western Australia and the Tasman Sea experiencing on average 2.5-3 MHWs per year. The 
average duration was between 10 and 15 days, with somewhat longer and hotter MHWs in the Tasman Sea. 
In New Zealand, the SE coast of the South Island experiences the most MHWs (2.5-3.0 per year). The 
duration of MHW in New Zealand is on average 10-15 days (Oliver et al., 2018). Changes over the 20th 
century, derived from MHW proxies, show an increase in frequency between 0.3 and 1.5 MHW per decade, 
except along the south east coast of New Zealand (Box 9.1); an increase in duration per event; and the total 
number of MHW days per decade, with the change being stronger in the Tasman Sea than elsewhere (Oliver 
et al., 2018). 
 
There is high confidence that MHWs will increase around most of Australasia. Under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 
respectively, mean SST is projected to increase by 1ºC and 2 ºC around Australia by 2100, with a hotspot of 
around 2 ºC for RCP4.5 and of 4ºC for RCP8.5 along the southeast coast between Sydney and Tasmania (see 
Interactive Atlas). Under all RCPs, the mean SST around Australia is expected to increase in the future, with 
median values of around 0.4-1.0 ºC by 2030 under RCP4.5, and 2-4 ºC by 2090 under RCP8.5 (CSIRO and 
BOM, 2015). Warming is expected to be largest along the north-west coast of Australia, southern Western 
Australia, and along the east coast of Tasmania (CSIRO and BOM, 2018). More frequent, extensive, intense 
and longer-lasting MHWs are projected around Australia and New Zealand for GWLs of 1.5 ºC, 2 ºC and 3.5 
ºC relative to the modelled reference value for 1861-1880 (Frölicher et al., 2018) Projections for SSP1-2.6 
and SSP5-8.5 both show an increase in MHWs around Australasia by 2081 – 2100, relative to 1985 – 2014 
(Box 9.2, Figure 1). 
 
*In general, there is high confidence that most coastal/ocean related hazards in Australasia will increase 
over the 21st century. Relative sea-level rise is virtually certain to continue in the oceans around 
Australasia, contributing to increased coastal flooding in low-lying areas (high confidence) and 
shoreline retreat along most sandy coasts (high confidence). Marine heatwaves are also expected to 
increase around the region over the 21st century (high confidence).* 
 
The assessed direction of change in climatic impact-drivers for Australasia and associated confidence levels 
are illustrated in Table 12.5, together with emergence time information (see Section 12.5.2). No assessable 
literature could be found for Hail and Snow avalanches, although these phenomena may be relevant in parts 
of the region.

## 12.4.4  Central and South America 
 
For the purpose of this assessment, Central and South America is sub-divided into eight sub-regions, as 
defined in Chapter 1: southern Central America (SCA), north western South America (NWS), northern South 
America (NSA), South American Monsoon (SAM), north eastern South America (NES), south western 
South America (SWS), south eastern South America (SES), and southern South America (SSA). The 
Caribbean is placed under the Small Islands section (12.4.7) of this chapter. 
 
Previous assessments have documented ongoing and projected changes in several CIDs. IPCC AR5 
projections (IPCC, 2014b) pointed to increases in mean temperature between 2-6oC by end of the century 
(high confidence) and increases in the occurrence of warm days and nights under various future climate 
scenarios (medium confidence). AR5 also pointed to patterns of changes in precipitation (medium 
confidence), changes in the duration of dry spells (medium confidence), and decreases in water supply (high 
confidence). IPCC SR1.5 projections indicated expected increases in river flooding and extreme runoff at 
2°C warming in parts of South America, and decreases in runoff in Central America, central and southern 
South America, and the Amazon basin. The IPCC SROCC reported an increased number of landslides, a 
decreased volume of lahars from ice and snow-clad volcanoes, and increased frequency of Glacier Lake 
Outburst Floods. SROCC also indicated that regional and local-scale projections point to decreasing trends 
in glacier runoff. 
 
New literature is now available for the regional climate as a result of observational research and coordinated 
modelling outputs of CORDEX South America (Solman, 2013; Sánchez et al., 2015) and CORDEX-CORE 
(Giorgi et al., 2018; Teichmann et al., 2019; Coppola et al., 2021b). Of particular interest are the new 
projections of both mean climate and extremes. This new regional climate information is key to main sectors 
sensitive to climate change in Central and South America such as water resources, infrastructure, agriculture, 
livestock, forestry, silviculture, and fisheries (Magrin, 2015; López Feldman and Hernández Cortés, 2016), 
human health (changes in morbidity and mortality, and emergence of diseases in previously non-endemic 
areas; (Núñez et al., 2016)) and biodiversity (Uribe Botero, 2015), urban planning, navigation and tourism.

### 12.4.4.1  Heat and cold 
 
*Mean air temperature:* New literature confirms a continuous warming since the beginning of the 20th 
century in the majority of the eight sub-regions (Atlas.7). However, observational datasets in several areas 
are still short and trend estimation is hindered by year-to-year and interannual variability. Atlas projections 
point to a virtually certain warming across all sub-regions, with the largest increases taking place in the 
Amazon Basin (NSA and SAM) (Atlas.7.2.4). A consistent increase in temperature-related indices linked to 
several climate-sensitive sectors (GDD, CDD) is found across CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX-CORE 
projections, with lesser increase for CDD in mid-latitude regions than in SCA and the Amazon (Coppola et 
al., 2021b). Daily mean temperature exceedances of a typical 21.5°C threshold for a successful incubation of 
disease pathogens inside many mosquito vectors (Lambrechts et al., 2011; Blanford et al., 2013; Mordecai et 
al., 2013, 2017) will be crossed much more frequently, potentially driving increases in the incidence of 
vector-borne diseases (Laporta et al., 2015; Messina et al., 2019). 
 
*Extreme heat:* Chapter 11 found high confidence of increased heat waves in all regions but SSA over the 
past decades. There is evidence of increasing heat stress over summertime in much of SES and SWS using 
the WBGT index for the period 1973-2012, and this has been attributed to human influence on the climate 
system (Knutson and Ploshay, 2016). Climate change projections point to major increases in several heat 
indices across the region for all scenarios (high confidence). Largest increases in the frequency of hot days 
(maximum temperatures, Tx > 35°C) are projected for the Amazon basin under SSP5-8.5 with more than 
200 days per year at the end of the century under SSP5-8.5, while such increases remain moderate (50-100 
days) in SSP1-2.6. For the dangerous heat threshold of HI>41°C, increases in frequency are similar to that in 
Tx>35°C (Figure 12.4 and Figure SM 1.1 and 1.2) (Coppola et al., 2021b; Schwingshackl et al., 2021). 
 
*Cold spell and frost:* A decreasing frequency of cold days and nights has been observed in many sub-
regions (Chapter 11). There is medium confidence (limited agreement) of a decrease in frost days in SWS, 
SES and SSA. Projections consistently suggest a general decrease in the frequency of cold spells and frost 
days in all sub-regions as indicated by several indices based on minimum temperature (Chou et al., 2014; 
López-Franca et al., 2016; Li et al., 2020b). Heating Degree Days are consistently projected to decrease by 5 
degree days per year in the Amazon region, and up to 20-30 degree days in NSA, SWS and SES, under 
future RCP8.5/SSP5-8.5 (Coppola et al., 2021b). 

*In conclusion, it is virtually certain that warming will continue everywhere in Central and South 
America and there is high confidence that by the end of century most regions will undergo extreme 
heat stress conditions much more often than in recent past (e.g., increase of dangerous heat HI>41°C, 
or Tx>35°C) with more than 200 additional days per year under SSP5-8.5, while such conditions will 
be met up typically 50-100 more days per year under SSP1-2.6 over the same regions. Cold spells and 
frost days will have a decreasing trend (high confidence).* 
 
 
### 12.4.4.2  Wet and dry 
 
*Mean precipitation:* The Atlas documents diverse historical precipitation trends in the region, including: a 
small but not significant increasing trend in SCA, a decreasing trend in south-eastern and north-eastern 
Brazil, and an increasing trend in SSA. Projections indicate a drying signal for SCA (medium confidence) 
(Coppola et al., 2014; Nakaegawa et al., 2014), NES and SWS (high confidence) (Atlas 7.2.5) and the well-
known dipole for South America, meaning increasing precipitation over subtropical regions like the Río de 
La Plata basin (SES) (high confidence) and decreased precipitation in the Amazon (NSA) (medium 
confidence) (Chou et al., 2014; Llopart et al., 2014; Reboita et al., 2014; Sánchez et al., 2015b; Teichmann et 
al., 2019). These features are consistent among observations (Sena et al., 2018) and are consistently evident 
in regional and global model projections by mid- and end-of-century for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (Jones 
and Carvalho, 2013) . 
 
*River flood:* Emerging literature in the region documents ongoing changes in river floods: (Mernild et al., 
2018) report decreases and increases in annual runoff on the west of the Andes Cordillera's continental 
divide, with the greatest decreases in the number of low (<10th percentile) runoff and the greatest increases in 
high (>90th percentile) runoff conditions. In coastal northeast Peru, extreme precipitation events recently 
caused devastating river floods and landslides (Son et al., 2020). In Brazil, floods are becoming more (less) 
frequent and intense in wet (drier) regions (Bartiko et al., 2019; Borges de Amorim and Chaffe, 2019), with 
higher propagation of hydrological changes through anthropogenically-modified agricultural basins (Chagas 
and Chaffe, 2018). Record, catastrophic, unprecedented, and once-in-a-century flooding events have also 
been reported in recent decades in the tributaries of the Amazon river or along its mainstream (Sena et al., 
2012; Espinoza et al., 2013; Marengo et al., 2013; Filizola et al., 2014), in Argentinean rural and urban areas 
(Barros et al., 2015), in the lower reaches of the Atrato, Cauca and Magdalena rivers in Colombia (Hoyos et 
al., 2013; Ávila et al., 2019), in basins whose mainstreams flow through important metropolitan areas such 
as Concepción, Chile (Rojas et al., 2017), and even in one of Earth's driest regions, the Atacama Desert 
(Wilcox et al., 2016). In the Amazon basin, the significant increase in extreme flow was associated with the 
strengthening of the Walker circulation (Barichivich et al., 2018). 
 
Emerging literature in the region documents projected increases for river floods in SES and SAM (medium 
confidence). Projections indicate that SES and the coasts of Ecuador and Peru will experience a tendency 
toward wetter conditions that can be a proxy for longer periods of flooding and enhanced river discharges 
(Zaninelli et al., 2019). CORDEX models project the strongest changes for the peak flow with a return 
period of 100 years in SES by mid-century and under RCP8.5. (Figure 12.8). At the continental scale, on the 
contrary, (Alfieri et al., 2017) suggest that 100-yr river floods are projected to decrease under RCP8.5. 
Regional projections of river floods have high uncertainty, however; owing to differences in hydrological 
models (Reyer et al., 2017a) (low confidence). Fábrega et al. (2013) projected increases in surface runoff for 
Panamá, while Zulkafli et al. (2016) identified increases in 100-yr floods of 7.5% and 12.0% in projections 
for the Peruvian Amazon wet season under RCPs 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. Wetter conditions and ±20% 
variations in annual mean streamflow are also projected for the Río de La Plata under the warming levels of 
1.5°C, 2°C and 3°C above pre‐industrial conditions (Montroull et al., 2018). In central Chile, 50-yr peak 
flows are expected to be greater by mid-century than 100-yr peak flows observed over the reference period 
(Bozkurt et al., 2018).  
 
*Heavy precipitation and pluvial flood:* Chapter 11 indicated that there is low confidence due to limited 
evidence of extreme precipitation trends in almost all Central and South America, except in SES where 
increases in the magnitude and frequency of heavy precipitation have been observed (high confidence). In 
general, data scarcity persists for a representative continental assessment. Chapter 11 projections indicate 
low confidence of increase, compared to the modern period, in the intensity and frequency of heavy 
precipitation in SCA and SWS for all GWLs, a medium confidence of increase in NSA, NES, SSA, SAM and 
SES for GWL of 4°C. In NWS, a wide range of changes is projected (low confidence). 
 
*Landslide:* Several regions in Central America, as well as Colombia and southeastern Brazil, are considered 
areas of high incidence of observed fatal landslides. In these areas, ENSO-driven fluctuations in rainfall 
amounts (Sepúlveda and Petley, 2015) and climate change (Nehren et al., 2019) seem to be key factors. Rock 
falls, ice- and rock-ice avalanches, lahars, and landslides have been reported in frequent number in the 
southern, extratropical Andes in the last decades (Gariano and Guzzetti, 2016). A large number of ice- and 
moraine-dammed lakes have consequently failed, causing floods that rank amongst the largest events ever 
recorded (Iribarren Anacona et al., 2015). However, due to research deficit, evidence is largely missing for a 
reliable assessment of past and future trends of such hazards. 
 
*Aridity:* Several new regional studies suggest positive trends in the frequency and length of droughts in the 
region, such as: over NWS (Domínguez-Castro et al., 2018), NSA (Marengo and Espinoza, 2016; Cunha et 
al., 2019) and NES (Marengo and Bernasconi, 2015), over southern Amazonia (Fu et al., 2013; Boisier et al., 
2015), in the São Francisco River Basin and the capital city Distrito Federal in Brazil (Borges et al., 2018; 
Bezerra et al., 2019), in the southern Andes (Vera and Díaz, 2015), in central southern Chile (Boisier et al., 
2018), in SES (Rivera and Penalba, 2014), and during recent years in SSA (Rivera and Penalba, 2014). 
Chapter 8 indicated medium confidence of anthropogenic forcing on observed drying trends in central Chile. 
Additional discussion on droughts and aridity trends in South America is presented in Chapter 8 (Sections 
8.3.1.6, 8.4.1.6, 8.6.2.1). 
 
Chapter 8 projections point to two important drying hotspots in South America with long-term soil moisture 
decline and precipitation declines, namely the Amazon basin (SAM and NSA) and SWS (medium 
confidence) (see also Figure 12.4). End-of-century RCP8.5 projections show a longer dry season in the 
central part of South America and decreased precipitation over the Amazon and central Brazil (Coppola et 
al., 2014; Giorgi et al., 2014b; Llopart et al., 2014; Teichmann et al. 2013) (Atlas.7). Seasonal changes are 
also apparent, with decreases in June-July-August rainfall projected for NSA, the coastal region of SES, 
SAM and the southern portion of the SWS (Marengo et al., 2016). Decreases in December-January-February 
rainfall are projected for the central part of South America in the near term (Kitoh et al., 2011; Chou et al., 
2014; Cabré et al., 2016). Regional projections for Central and South America also indicate an increase in 
dryness in SCA and NES by mid to end of the century (medium confidence) (Chou et al., 2014; Marengo and 
Bernasconi, 2015).  
 
*Hydrological drought:* Chapter 11 assessed mostly low confidence in observed changes in hydrological 
droughts given a lack of studies and clear evidence, with medium confidence only for a streamflow decrease 
in subregions of SWS. Some trends are becoming more clear, such as the ones reported for Colombia (NWS) 
by Carmona and Poveda (2014), who indicated that 62% of the 25- to 50-year long monthly average 
streamflow time series exhibited significant decreasing trends. However, studies of discharge changes 
indicate that uncertainty is still large, as argued by Pabón-Caicedo et al. (2020) for the full extent of the 
Andes. 
 
A number of studies project decreases in runoff and river discharge for SCA, Colombia, Brazil and the 
southern part of South America by the end of this century (Nakaegawa and Vergara, 2010; Arnell and 
Gosling, 2013; van Vliet et al., 2013). Section 11.9 assessed high confidence in projections of increases in 
hydrological droughts in NSA, SAM, SWS, and SSA under a +4°C GWL, medium confidence in SCA, and 
low confidence in the rest of the sub-regions given insufficient evidence, lack of signal or mixed signals 
among the available studies. Signals are much more uncertain for the middle of the century (or for a 2°C 
GWL), with only SAM projected to have increased hydrological droughts with medium confidence. 
 
*Agricultural and ecological drought:* Section 11.9 assessed low confidence in observed changes to 
agricultural and ecological drought across Central and South America due to regional heterogeneity and 
differences depending on the drought metrics used, except in NES which has seen a dominant increase in 
drought severity (medium confidence).  
 
NSA and SAM are the two regions where the strongest signal of increasing number of dry days (NDD) and 
drought frequency (DF) is projected compared to other regions of the world (Coppola et al., 2021b). By the 
end of this century and under RCP8.5, the NSA area average value for NDD reaches 43, 32 and 27, within 
the CORDEX-CORE, CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensembles, respectively.  For the frequency of droughts, the NSA 
area average value is of about 4.6, 3.4 and 3.8. The SAM region shows NDD and DF values of 29, 20 and 
21, and of 4, 3 and 3.5, respectively (see also Figure 12.4j-l). In Central America, a significantly drier 
northern region and a wetter southern region were projected for mid-century by (Hidalgo et al., 2017), whilst 
Fuentes-Franco et al. (2015) pointed to more pronounced dry periods during the rainy season in SCA by the 
end of this century under RCP8.5. Increases in the frequency of meteorological droughts that may initiate 
other drought types are projected for the eastern part of the Amazon and the opposite for the west under 
RCP8.5 (Duffy et al., 2015). In central Chile, the occurrence of extended droughts, such as the recently-
experienced 2010-2015 mega-drought (which is still driving impacts), is projected to increase from one to up 
to five events per 100 years under RCP8.5 (Bozkurt et al., 2018). Section 11.9 highlights change in 
confidence in increases in drought severity in SCA, NSA, NES, SAM, SWS, and SSA from low to high 
under the three GWLs of +1.5°C, +2°C and +4°C. NES and SES change from low confidence to medium 
confidence increases in agricultural and ecological drought severity by +4°C GWL with different metrics and 
high agreement between studies. Only SAM and SSA have projections of agricultural and ecological drought 
increasing with high confidence for the middle of the century, or for a +2°C GWL, and NSA, NES and SCA 
are increasing with medium confidence. 
 
*Fire weather:* There is evidence of increases in forest fire activity (number of fires, burned area and fire 
duration) such as in central and south-central Chile, where more conducive fire weather conditions have been 
proposed as the main driver (González et al., 2018; Urrutia-Jalabert et al., 2018). Projections indicate that the 
Amazon is one of the regions in the world with the highest increase in fire weather indices over the 21st 
century and under all RCPs (high confidence) (Betts et al., 2015; Abatzoglou et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2019b). 
This is consistent with the large increase in the frequency of joint occurrence of extreme hot and dry days for 
a 2°C warming level or more (Vogel et al., 2020). Projections of fire weather indices also show an increased 
risk in SWS (high confidence), SSA and SCA (medium confidence). However, wildfires highly depend on 
land-use and appropriate management may help mitigate future increases in fire risk (Fonseca et al., 2019). 
 
*Mean precipitation is projected to change in a dipole pattern with increases in NWS and SES and 
decreases in NES and SWS (high confidence) with further decreases in NSA and SCA (medium 
confidence).  There is medium confidence of an increase in river floods in SAM and SES. There is high 
confidence of a dominant increase in drought duration in NES, an in the number of dry days and 
drought frequency in NSA and SAM. Dry climatic impact-drivers have more prevalent regional 
increases with higher global warming levels, with strongest projections of agricultural and ecological 
drought (high confidence) and aridity and fire changes (medium confidence) over the Amazon and with 
both drought types increasing over the SWS (medium confidence).*  
 
 
### 12.4.4.3  Wind 
 
*Mean wind speed:* Due to the lack of long-term homogeneous records or limited observations in the region, 
past wind speed trends are difficult to establish. Global climate models project an increase in wind speeds, 
under all future scenarios, augmenting wind power potential in most parts of Central and South America, 
especially in NES where changes lie in the range 0-20% by 2050 under RCP8.5 and 0-40% under RCP8.5 
(medium confidence) (Karnauskas et al., 2018a; Reboita et al., 2018; Jung and Schindler, 2019). In 
Patagonia, wind speeds are projected to decrease. For RCP4.5 changes remain marginal and have low 
confidence (low agreement). Further information in (Figure 12.4m-o). 
 
*Severe wind storm:* Similar observational limitations inhibit an assessment of long-term extreme wind 
trends. However, (Pes et al., 2017) found extreme wind increases in most of Brazil over the past decades. 
Future projections indicate a slight decrease in the number of extra-tropical cyclones in mid latitudes (limited 
evidence, low confidence) (Reboita et al., 2018), and an increase of extreme winds in tropical areas (limited 
evidence, low confidence) (Kumar et al., 2015). Climate models project a shift and an intensification of 
southern storm tracks, with most effects offshore over the Southern ocean (Chapter 4), with low confidence 
(low agreement) of significant extreme wind changes over land and coastal areas across the 21st century 
(Chang, 2017; Augusto Sanabria and Carril, 2018; Reboita et al., 2020). 
 
*Tropical cyclone:* CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulations, including the new HighResMIP, project a decrease in the 
frequency of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Central America for the mid-century or 
under a 2°C global warming level, accompanied with an increased frequency of intense cyclones (medium 
confidence) (Diro et al., 2014; Knutson et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2020) (Chapter 11). 
 
*In summary, there is limited evidence of current trends in observed wind speed and wind storms in 
South America. Climate projections indicate a decrease in frequency of tropical cyclones in Central 
America accompanied with an increased frequency of intense cyclones, and an increase in mean wind 
speed and wind power potential in NES, NSA and SAM (medium confidence).*
 
 
### 12.4.4.4  Snow and ice 
 
*Snow:* Studies on seasonal snow cover are limited and restricted to the Andes Cordillera. Mernild et al. 
(2017) indicated that much of the area north of 23°S experienced a decrease in the number of snow cover 
days, while the southern half experienced the opposite. A reduction in snow cover of about 15% was 
simulated for areas in the range [3000-5000 m], whereas in regions with altitude below 1000 m (Patagonia) 
snow cover extent increased. The reduced snowfall over the Chilean and Argentinean Andes mountains, 
which has resulted in unprecedented reductions in river flow, reservoir volumes and groundwater levels, led 
to the most severe and long-lasting hydrological drought (2010-2015) reported in the adjacent semi-arid 
foothills of the central Andes (Garreaud et al., 2017; Rivera et al., 2017; Masiokas et al., 2020). Projections 
(based on process understanding) in Chapter 9 point to decreases in seasonal snow cover extent and duration 
across South America as global climate continues to warm (high confidence). 
 
*Glacier:* Observation and future projection of Central and South America glacier mass changes are assessed 
in Section 9.5.1, grouped in two main regions: Low Latitude region (98% of which is glaciers in the Andes) 
and the Southern Andes region. An increase in the number and areal extent of glacial lakes in the Southern 
Andes was reported for the period 1986-2016 (Wilson et al., 2018). Similar changes are being observed in 
the central Andes (Colonia et al., 2017). Since 1800 at least 15 ice‐dammed lakes and 16 moraine‐dammed 
lakes have failed in the extratropical Andes, causing high-magnitude Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (Rojas et 
al., 2014; Cook et al., 2016; Wilson et al., 2018; Drenkhan et al., 2019). Partially due to glaciers shrinkage 
and lake growth, the frequency of outburst floods has increased in the last 30-40 years (Carey et al., 2012; 
Iribarren Anacona et al., 2015). 
 
Glaciers across South America are expected to continue to lose mass and glacier area in the coming century 
(high confidence) (Section 9.5).  In term of their mass, glaciers in the Low Latitude region are projected by 
GlacierMIP to lose 67 ± 42%, 86 ± 24% and 94 ± 13%, of their 2015 baseline by the end of the century 
under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively (Marzeion et al., 2020). Glaciers in the Southern 
Andes show decreasing mass loss rates for RCP2.6, and increasing rates for RCP8.5, which peak in the mid 
to late 21st century. Glaciers in the Southern Andes are projected to lose 26 ± 27%, 33 ± 26%, and 47 ± 26% 
of their mass in 2015 by the end of the century under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. 
Details in (Section 9.5.1.3). 
 
*Permafrost:* There is limited information on the ongoing changes and projections of permafrost conditions 
in the region. Based on model projections under the IPCC A1B scenario, permafrost areas in the Bolivian 
Andes will eventually be lost, but this could take years to decades or longer depending on permafrost 
thickness (Rangecroft et al., 2016). The central Andes will experience the highest disturbance to the thermal 
regime of the twenty-first century. As a consequence, in the Argentinian Andes up to 95% of rock glaciers in 
the southern Desert Andes and in the central Andes will rest in areas above 0 °C under the worst case 
scenario of warming (the freezing level might move up more than twice as much as during the entire 
Holocene) (Drewes et al., 2018). 
 
*In conclusion, glacier volume loss and permafrost thawing will likely continue in the Andes Cordillera 
under all climate scenarios, causing important reductions in river flow and potentially high-magnitude 
Glacial Lake Outburst Floods.*
 
 
### 12.4.4.5  Coastal and oceanic 
 
*Relative sea level:* Around Central and South America, over 1900-2018, a new tide-gauge based 
reconstruction finds a regional-mean relative sea level (RSL) change of 2.07 [1.36 to 2.77] mm yr<sup>-1</sup> in the 
South Atlantic, 2.49 [1.89 to 3.06] mm yr<sup>-1</sup> in the subtropical North Atlantic and 1.20 [0.76 to1.62] mm yr<sup>-1</sup> 
in the East Pacific (Frederikse et al., 2020), compared to a global mean sea level (GMSL) change of around 
1.7 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> (Section 2.3.3.3; Table 9.5). For the period 1993-2018, these RSLR rates, based on satellite 
altimetry, increased to 3.45 [3.04to 3.86)] mm yr<sup>-1</sup>, 4.04 [2.77 to 5.24] mm yr<sup>-1</sup> and 2.35 [0.70 to 4.06]  mm 
yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively (Frederikse et al., 2020), compared to a GMSL change of 3.25 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> (Section 2.3.3.3; 
Table 9.5). 
 
Relative sea-level rise is extremely likely to continue in the oceans around CSA. Regional-mean RSLR 
projections for the oceans around Central and South America range from 0.3 m–0.5 m under SSP1-RCP2.6 
to 0.5 m–0.9 m under SSP5-RCP8.5 for 2081-2100 relative to 1995-2014 (median values), which is around 
the projected GMSL change {Section 9.6.3.3}. These RSLR projections may however be underestimated due 
to potential partial representation of land subsidence in their assessment (Section 9.6.3.2). 
 
*Coastal flood:* Present day 1:100 yr Extreme Total Water Level (ETWL) ranges from 0.5 to 2.5 m around 
most of Central and South America, except in SSA and SWS subregions where 1:100 yr ETWLs can be as 
large as 5 to 6 m (Vousdoukas et al., 2018). ETWL magnitude and occurrence frequency are expected to 
increase throughout the region (high confidence) (see Figure 12.4p-r and Figure SM 12.6). Across the region, 
the 5th – 95th percentile range of the 1:100 yr ETWL is projected increase (relative to 1980 – 2014) by 8 cm – 
34 cm and by 10 cm – 43 cm by 2050 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively (Vousdoukas et al., 2018; 
Kirezci et al., 2020). By 2100, this range is projected to be 21 cm – 93 cm and 34 cm – 190 cm under 
RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively (Vousdoukas et al., 2018; Kirezci et al., 2020). Furthermore, under 
RCP4.5, the present day 1:100 yr ETWL is projected to have median return periods of 1:10 yrs – 1:50 yrs by 
2050 and 1:1 yr by 2100 in SES, SSA and SWS. In other regions of Central and South America, the present 
day 1:100 yr ETWL is projected to occur once per year or more by both 2050 and 2100 under RCP4.5. The 
present day 1:50 yr ETWL is projected to occur around 3 times a year by 2100 with a SLR of 1 m (Vitousek 
et al., 2017). 
 
*Coastal erosion:* According to satellite data, shoreline retreat rates of around 1 m yr<sup>-1</sup> have been observed 
along the sandy coasts of SCA, SES and SSA over the period 1984-2015, while shoreline progradation rates 
of around 0.25 m /yr has been observed in NWS and NSA. The sandy shorelines in NES and SWS have 
remained more or less stable over the same period (Luijendijk et al., 2018; Mentaschi et al., 2018). Using 
satellite observations, Mentaschi et al. (2018) report a coastal area loss of 250 km2 over a 30-year period 
(1984-2015) along the Pacific coast of South America, and of 780 km2 along the Atlantic coastlines.  
 
Projections indicate that a majority of sandy coasts in the region will experience shoreline retreat throughout 
the 21st century (high confidence). Median shoreline change projections (CMIP5) for the mid-century period 
show that, relative to 2010, presented by Vousdoukas et al. (2020) show that sandy shorelines will retreat by 
between 30 m and 75 m in SCA, NES, SES and SSA under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, while the projected 
mid-century retreats are less than 30 m in NSA, NWS and SWS for both RCPs (Vousdoukas et al., 2020). 
Parts of the coastline in these latter three regions projected to prograde over the 21st century, if present 
ambient shoreline change trends continue (Vousdoukas et al., 2020). By 2100, median retreats of more than 
100 m are projected in SCA, NES, SES and SSA under both RCPs, while retreats between 50 m – 100 m are 
projected for NSA, NWS, and SWS under both RCPs (Figure 12.8). Notably, the projected shoreline retreats 
in SCA and SES approach 150 m by 2100 under RCP4.5 and 200 m under RCP8.5. The total length of sandy 
coasts in Central and South America that is projected to retreat by more than a median of 100 m by 2100 
under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 is about 15,000 km and 12,000 km respectively, an increase of approximately 
30%. 
 
*Marine heatwave:* The mean sea surface temperature (SST) of the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean around 
Central and South America increased from 0.25°C to 1°C over the period 1982-1998 (Oliver et al., 2018). 
This mean ocean surface warming is connected to longer and more frequent marine heatwaves (MHW) in the 
region (Oliver et al., 2018). Over the period 1982-2016, the coastlines experienced on average more than 1.0 
MHW per year, with the Pacific coast of North Central America and the coast of SES (Atlantic) experiencing 
on average 2.5-3.0 MHWs per year. The average duration was between 10 and 15 days, with the notable 
exception of the Equatorial Pacific coastline, which experiences MHWs with >30 days average duration 
related to ENSO conditions. In the Southwestern Atlantic shelf (32-38°S), more than half of the days with 
MHWs have occurred since 2014, and the most intense event (1.7°C above previous maximum) took place 
in the austral summer of 2017 (Manta et al., 2018). Changes over the 20th century, derived from MHW 
proxies, show an increase in frequency between 0.5 and 2.0 MHW per decade in the South Atlantic, the 
Caribbean and the Pacific coast of North Central America, an increase in intensity per event in the South 
Atlantic, and a decrease along the Equatorial Pacific coastline. The total number of MHW days per year 
increases around Central and South America, with the exception of the Equatorial Pacific coastline (Oliver et 
al., 2018). 
 
There is high confidence that MHWs will increase around Central and South America. Mean SST is 
projected to increase by 1ºC (2ºC) by 2100, with a hotspot of about 2ºC (4ºC) along the coast of South East 
South America and North West South America under RCP4.5 (RCP8.5). (See Interactive Atlas). More 
frequent, MHWs are projected around the region for GWLs of 1.5 ºC, 2 ºC and 3.5 ºC relative to the 
modelled reference value for 1861-1880 (Frölicher et al., 2018). Projections for SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 both 
show an increase in MHWs around Central and South America by 2081 – 2100, relative to 1985 – 2014 (Box 
9.2, Figure 1). 
 
*In summary, relative sea-level rise is extremely likely to continue in the oceans around Central and 
South America, contributing to increased coastal flooding in low-lying areas (high confidence) and 
shoreline retreat along most sandy coasts (high confidence). Marine heatwaves are also expected to 
increase around the region over the 21st century (high confidence).* 
 
The assessed direction of change in climatic impact-drivers for Central and South America and associated 
confidence levels are illustrated in Table 12.6. No assessable literature could be found for sand and dust 
storm, lake and sea ice, heavy snowfall and ice storms, hail, and snow avalanches, although these 
phenomena may be relevant in parts of the region.

## 12.4.5  Europe 

The regional European climate and main hazards have been previously assessed in SREX, AR5 (WGII), 
SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL and a summary of key findings can be found in the Europe section of the Atlas 
8.1. For the purpose of these assessment Europe is divided in four climatic regions North Europe (NEU), 
Western and Central Europe (WCE), Eastern Europe (EE) and Mediterranean (MED) (see Figure Atlas.27). 
 
Since AR5 and SR1.5, a large body of literature that uses the EURO-CORDEX and MED-CORDEX 
ensembles of high-resolution simulations (Jacob et al., 2014; Ruti et al., 2016; Kjellström et al., 2018; 
Vautard et al., 2020; Coppola et al., 2021a)  to assess signals of climate change in Europe has emerged. 
These scenario simulations have been the basis of a number of impact studies (see e.g., Jacob et al., 2014b, 
2018; Somot et al., 2018; Faggian and Decimi, 2019) ) highlighting the use of the climatic impact-drivers. 
The development of the science of attribution of weather events (Stott et al., 2016) has provided evidence of 
links between climate change and hazard changes such as the 2017 Mediterranean heat wave (Kew et al., 
2019) and many others (see Chapter 11).  
 
The ability of global and regional models to reproduce the observed changes in mean and extreme 
temperature and precipitation in Europe is assessed in the literature (see Atlas 8.3). In summary, both GCMs 
and RCMs have their limitations but, in general, the increased resolution of RCMs is shown to clearly add 
valued in terms of resolving spatial patterns and seasonal cycles of precipitation and precipitation extremes 
in many European regions, especially in regions of complex topography such as the Alps and for quantities 
such as snowmelt driven runoff, regional winds and Mediterranean hurricanes (Medicanes). 
 
Examples of projected hazard thresholds are illustrated in Figures 12.4 and 12.9 based on the most recently 
updated Euro-CORDEX RCM projections, CMIP5 and CMIP6 GCMs for comparison. For a more 
comprehensive representation of other hazard index trends assessed in this section the reader is referred to 
the interactive Atlas.

### 12.4.5.1  Heat and Cold 
 
*Mean air temperature:* Since AR5, studies have confirmed that the mean warming trend in Europe is 
increasing (Atlas.8.2). The observed warming trend patterns are largely consistent with those simulated by 
global and regional climate models and it is very likely that such trends are, in large part, due to human 
influence on climate (Chapter 3).   
 
All temperature trends are very likely to continue for a global warming of 1.5°C or 2°C and 3oC (Atlas 8.4). 
Future warming leads to the exceedance of different temperature thresholds relevant for vector-borne 
diseases  (medium confidence) (Caminade et al., 2012; Medlock et al., 2013), invasive allergens (medium 
confidence) (Storkey et al., 2014; Hamaoui-Laguel et al., 2015), SST thresholds in the Mediterranean (likely 
to exceed 20°C), or relevant for the vibrio bacteria development (Vezzulli et al., 2015). Future warming is 
also projected to lead to the exceedance of cooling degree-day index (>22°C) thresholds, characterizing a 
potential increase in energy demand for cooling in Southern Europe with increases likely exceeding 40% in 
some areas (Spinoni et al., 2015) by 2050 under RCP8.5 (high confidence) (Coppola et al., 2021a) (see also 
Atlas and Section 12.3). 
 
*Extreme heat:* The frequency of  heat waves observed in Europe has very likely increased in recent decades 
due to human-induced change in atmospheric composition (see Chapter 11) and a detectable anthropogenic 
increase in a summertime heat stress index over all regions of Europe has been identified based on wet bulb 
globe temperature (WBGT) index trends for 1973-2012 (medium confidence, limited evidence) (Knutson and 
Ploshay, 2016). 
 
It is very likely that the frequency of heat waves will increase during the 21st century regardless of the 
emission scenario in each European region, and for 1.5°C and 2°C global warming levels (GWLs) (Chapter 
11). Heat stress due to both high temperature and humidity, affecting morbidity, mortality and labor capacity 
(see Section 12.3) is projected to increase under all emission scenarios and GWLs by the middle of the 
century (Figure 12.4a-f). Under RCP8.5, the expected number of days with WBGT larger than 31°C of about  
25, 30 and 40 days per year, projected by EURO-CORDEX, CMIP5 and CMIP6 respectively on average 
over the Mediterranean region, and specifically of 30, 40 and 60 days per year in low coastal plain areas such 
as the Po Valley, the Italian, Greek and Spanish coasts and the Mediterranean islands in (Coppola et al., 
2021a). An average increase of a few days per year of maximum daily temperature exceeding 35°C, a typical 
critical threshold for crop productivity, is expected by the mid-century in Central Europe, and a further 
increase of 10-20 days is expected for the Mediterranean areas (see Figure 12.4b) (Coppola et al., 2021a). By 
contrast, under SSP1-2.6, the increase in this number of days remain limited to less than about 10 days, and 
confined to the Mediterranean regions. Mitigation is expected to have a strong effect: by the end of century, 
and under SSP5-8.5, dangerous heat threshold of HI>41°C is projected to be crossed 5-10 days more per 
year in the Mediterranean regions and a few days per year more in WCE and EEU while these increases 
would virtually be absent under SSP1-2.6 (Figure 12.4d-f). 
 
*Cold spell and frost:* Temperature observations for winter cold spells in Europe show a long-term 
decreasing frequency (Brunner et al., 2018),  with their probability of occurrence projected to decrease in the 
future (high confidence) and virtually disappear by the end of the century (Chapter 11). The frequency of 
frost days will very likely decrease for all scenario and all time horizons  (Lindner et al., 2014; Coppola et al, 
2021) with consequences on agriculture and forests. A simple heating degree-day index, characterizing 
heating demand, shows a large observed decreasing trend for winter heating energy demand in Europe 
(Spinoni et al., 2015),. This trend is very likely to continue through the 21st century, with decreases in the 
range of 20-30% for Northern Europe, about 20% for Central Europe and 35% for Southern Europe, by mid-
century under RCP8.5 (Spinoni et al., 2018b; Coppola et al., 2021a) (See also the interactive Atlas). 
 
*In summary, irrespective of the scenario, it is virtually certain that warming will continue in Europe, 
and there is high confidence that the observed increase in heat extremes is due to human activities. It is 
very likely that the frequency of heat extremes will increase over the 21st century with an increasing 
gradient toward the Southern regions. Extreme heat will exceed critical thresholds for health, 
agriculture and other sectors more frequently (high confidence), with strong differences between 
mitigation scenarios. It is very likely that the frequency of cold spells and frost days will keep 
decreasing over the course of this century and it is likely that cold spells will virtually disappear 
towards the end of the century.*
 
 
### 12.4.5.2  Wet and Dry 
 
*Mean precipitation:* Precipitation has generally increased in Northern Europe and decreased in Southern 
Europe, especially in winter (Fischer and Knutti, 2016, Knutson and Zeng, 2018) but in the latter 
precipitation trends are strongly dependent on the examined period (Chapter 11). The trend in precipitation 
increase in the north and decreasing in the south is also represented by global and regional climate 
simulations (Jacob et al., 2014; Rajczak and Schär, 2017; Lionello and Scarascia, 2018; Coppola et al., 
2021a) (see  Atlas.8.2) and has been attributed to climate change (Chapter 3, Chapter 8). 
 
Studies since AR5, together with EURO-CORDEX and MED-CORDEX experiments and the latest CMIP6 
ensemble, have increased confidence in regional projections of mean and extreme precipitation (Prein et al., 
2016) despite their wet bias, and show that it is very likely that precipitation will increase in Northern Europe 
in DJF  and decrease in the Mediterranean in JJA under all climate scenarios except RCP2.6/SSP1-2.6 and 
for both mid and end century periods (Coppola et al., 2021a). (Atlas 8.5). 
 
*River flood:* There is high confidence of an observed increasing trend of river floods in Central and Western 
Europe (WCE) and medium confidence of a decrease in northern (NEU) and Southern Europe (MED). 
 
SR1.5 shows evidence of an increase in reported floods in the UK over the period 1884-2013, and increasing 
trends in annual maximum daily streamflow data over 1966–2005 in parts of Europe. Although, high flow 
does not show uniform trends for the entire region (Hall et al., 2014; Mediero et al., 2015) or specific region 
(Mudersbach et al., 2017; Tramblay et al., 2019; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2017), regional patterns of 
significant flood trends do exist. Based on the most extended river flow database spanning the period 1960-
2010, an increase in  floods frequency in northwestern Europe, decreasing in medium and large catchments 
in southern Europe and decreasing floods in eastern Europe has been detected (Blöschl et al., 2019) in line 
with (Mediero et al., 2014; Arheimer and Lindström, 2015; Gudmundsson et al., 2017; Krysanova et al., 
2017; Kundzewicz et al., 2018; Mangini et al., 2018)  
 
There is high confidence of river floods increasing in Central and Western Europe (WCE) and medium 
confidence of a decrease in northern (NEU) Eastern (EE) and Southern Europe (MED) for mid and end of 
century under RCP8.5 and low confidence under RCP2.6. The  projected increase in WCE  is roughly 10% 
(18% by end of century) and the projected decrease in NEU is of 5% (11% by end of century) for the peak 
flow with a return period of 100 years for mid-century, under RCP8.5 (Di Sante et al., 2021) (See Figure 
12.9a for mid of century Q(100) projections of flood discharges per unit catchment area (Blöschl et al., 2019) 
based on EURO-CORDEX models). 
 
Using frequency analysis of extreme peak flow events above a 100-year return period as a threshold, which 
is the average protection level of the European river network (Rojas et al., 2013), Alfieri et al. (2017) and 
Alfieri et al. (2015) show that Europe is likely to be one of the regions where the largest increases in flood 
risk may occur, with only few countries in Eastern Europe showing a decrease (Poland Lithuania, Belarus) 
(Osuch et al., 2017). They find a significant increase of events with peak discharge above 100-year return 
period (Q100) in most of Europe in line with (Rojas et al., 2012; Hirabayashi et al., 2013; Dankers et al., 
2014; Forzieri et al., 2016; Roudier et al., 2016; Thober et al., 2018) and an increase in the magnitude of 
floods in southern Europe, although (Giuntoli et al., 2015) projects no change. A modest but significant 
decrease in the 100-year return period river flood is projected for Southern (due to reduction of precipitation) 
and north Eastern European regions  the latter because of the strong reduction in snowmelt induced river 
floods (Thober et al., 2018; Di Sante et al., 2021). 
 
*Heavy precipitation and pluvial flood:* Heavy precipitation frequency trends have been detected in Europe 
with high confidence for the NEU and Alpine regions and with medium confidence in WCE, and also 
attributed to climate change with high confidence in NEU (Section 11.9).  
 
Projections based on multiple lines of evidence from global to convective permitting model scales show high 
confidence in extreme precipitation increase in the northern, central and eastern European regions (NEU, 
WCE, EEU and in the Alpine area, Increases with medium confidence are projected for the Mediterranean 
basin (with a negative gradient toward the south) for mid and end of century under RCP8.5, RCP4.5, and 
SSP5-8.5 (Section 11.9) (MedECC, 2020). Guerreiro et al. (2017), based on observations, showed that 20% 
of city areas in WCE and MED regions is affected by pluvial flooding and less than 10% of city areas in the 
Northern and Western coastal cities.  
 
*Landslide:* Increase of rainfall periods connected to landslides are projected to increase in central Europe by 
up to 1 more period per year in flat areas in low altitudes and by up to 14 more periods per year at higher 
altitudes by mid-century, becoming even more evident by end of the century (Schlögl and Matulla, 2018). 
An increase of landslides by up to + 45.7% and + 21.2% is also projected for Southern Italy (Calabria 
region) by mid of century under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (Gariano and Guzzetti, 2016) and by up to 40% in 
Central Italy (Umbria) during the winter season (Ciabatta et al., 2016). A decrease of landslides is projected 
in the Peloritani Mountains in Southern Italy (RCP4.5 and 8.5) by mid of the century (Peres and Cancelliere, 
(2018)). A slight increase (10 year return period) in landslides is projected in the Eastern Carpathians, the 
Moldavian Subcarpathian and the northern part of the Moldavian Tableland and higher increase in the 
western hilly and plateau areas of Romania (100 year return period) (Jurchescu et al., 2017). 
 
*Aridity:* The Mediterranean region shows evidence of large-scale decreasing precipitation trends over 1901-
2010, which are at least partly attributable to anthropogenic forcing according to CMIP5 models (Knutson 
and Zeng (2018). Nevertheless, there is low agreement among studies on observed precipitation trend in the 
Mediterranean region. (Chapter 11; Atlas 8.2).  
 
The precipitation is projected to decrease by mid and end of century for the RCP8.5 and SSP5-85 with 
strong agreement among CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX regional climate ensemble models on the direction 
of change. With both temperature increase and precipitation decrease there is high confidence on increase 
aridity in the MED region. (Coppola et al., 2021 Atlas.8.2; Chapter 4; Chapter 8). 
 
*Hydrological drought:* There is high confidence that hydrological droughts have increased in the 
Mediterranean basin with medium confidence in anthropogenic attribution of the signal, and high confidence 
that they will continue to increase through the 21st century for 2oC GWL and higher and all scenarios. 
(Section 11.9; Chapter 8). There is medium confidence in hydrological drought increase in WCE and low 
confidence in direction of change for EEU and NEU from mid-century onward and for 2°C GWL and higher 
and all scenarios (Section 11.9) (see Figure 12.4g-i) 
 
Streamflow droughts are projected become more severe and persistent in Mediterranean and Western Europe 
(current 100-year events could occur approximately every 2 to 5 years by 2080) (Forzieri et al., 2016).  
The opposite tendency is projected in Northern, Eastern and Central Europe where higher precipitation that 
outweigh the effects of increased evapotranspiration is expected to result in a decrease in streamflow drought 
frequency (Forzieri et al. 2014). For a 2oC GWL droughts will become more intense in the MED and in 
France and longer mainly due to less rainfall and higher evapotranspiration. A reduction of drought length 
and magnitude is projected for NEU and EEU (Roudier et al., 2016). In the Southern Alps, both winter and 
summer low flows are projected to be more severe, with a 25% decrease in the 2050s (Vidal et al., 2016). 
 
*Agricultural and ecological drought:* There is medium confidence that agricultural and ecological droughts 
have increased in Western and Central Europe and in the Mediterranean region, and medium confidence that 
anthropogenic drivers contributed to the Mediterranean increase (Section 11.9, Chapter 8).  
 
Chapter 11 assesses that agricultural and ecological droughts will increase in the Mediterranean regions 
(high confidence) and Western and Central Europe (medium confidence) by mid-century with high 
confidence by the end of century for the MED for 2oC GWL and higher and all scenarios.  Low confidence in 
direction of change is assessed for EEU and NEU (see Figure 12.4k). 
 
Recent local studies provide additional risk-relevant context to changes in European drought. Agricultural 
and ecological drought conditions are expected to intensify in Southern Europe by end-of-century based on 
the 12-month rainfall Drought Severity Index (a soil moisture indicator), precipitation deficit SPI and SPEI 
indices. There will be regions in Southern Europe where this type of drought could be up to 14 times worse 
than the worst drought in the historical period (Guerreiro et al., 2018). One-in-10 year drought events are 
projected to happen every second year (Mora et al., 2018; Ruosteenoja et al., 2018). The Mediterranean 
region will have 100 additional stress years (years with three consecutive months of precipitation deficits 
greater than 25%) (Giorgi et al., 2018);  an increase of both drought frequency (up to 2 events per decade) 
and severity (Spinoni et al., 2014, 2019a) and an increase of consecutive dry day (CDD) in the southern part 
of the MED region (Lionello and Scarascia, 2020). In contrast, droughts are expected to decrease in winter in 
Northern Europe (Spinoni et al., 2018a; Section 11.9). These findings are confirmed by the EURO-
CORDEX, CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensemble that show a change of frequency of drought events in the MED 
between 2 and 3 events per decade for mid of the century RCP8.5 scenario (Coppola et al., 2021a) (see also 
Figure SM 1.3 ) 
 
*Fire weather:* Fire weather conditions have been increasing since about 1980 over a few regions in Europe 
including Mediterranean areas (low confidence) (Venäläinen et al., 2014; Urbieta et al., 2019; Barbero et al., 
2020; Giannaros et al., 2021). However beyond a few studies, evidence is largely missing about attribution 
of these trends to anthropogenic climate change (Forzieri et al., 2016). An increase in fire weather is 
projected for most of Europe, especially Western, Eastern and Central regions, by 2080 (current 100-yr. 
events will occur every 5 to 50 years), with a progressive increase in confidence and model agreement along 
the 21st century (medium confidence) (Forzieri et al., 2016; Abatzoglou et al., 2019). With increased drying 
and heat combined, in Mediterranean areas, an increase in fire weather indices is projected under RCP4.5 
and RCP8.5, or SRES A1B, as early as by the mid century (Bedia et al., 2014; Abatzoglou et al., 2019; 
Dupuy et al., 2020; Fargeon et al., 2020; Ruffault et al., 2020) (high confidence) and an increase in burned 
area of 40% and 100% for a 2oC and 3oC respectively (Turco et al., 2018).  
 
*In summary, there is high confidence that river floods will increase in Central and Western Europe 
and medium confidence that they will decrease in Northern, Eastern and Southern Europe, for mid 
and end of century under RCP8.5 and with low confidence under RCP2.6. There is high confidence 
that aridity will increase by mid and end of century for the RCP8.5 and SSP5-85, and high confidence 
that agricultural, ecological and hydrological droughts will increase in the Mediterranean region by 
mid and far end of century under all RCPs except RCP2.6/SSP1-2.6 and also for 2oC and higher 
GWLs. There is high confidence in fire weather increase in the Mediterranean region.* 

### 12.4.5.3  Wind  
 
*Mean wind speed:* Mean surface wind speeds have decreased in Europe as in many other areas of the 
Northern Hemisphere over the past four decades (AR5, WGI) (medium confidence), with a reversal to an 
increasing trend in the last decade (low confidence) that is however not fully consistent across studies (Tian 
et al., 2019; Zeng et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019d; Deng et al., 2021) (Chapter 2). Reanalyses also show 
declining winds in Europe (Deng et al., 2021) with large interdecadal variability (Laurila et al., 2020). The 
declining trend has induced a corresponding decline in wind power potential indices across Europe (low 
confidence) (Tian et al., 2019). However, there is low agreement  and low evidence that climate model 
historical trends are consistent with observed trends (Tian et al., 2019; Deng et al., 2021) . Several factors 
have been attributed to these trends, including forest growth, urbanization, local changes in wind 
measurement exposure and aerosols (Bichet et al., 2012), as well as natural variability (Zeng et al., 2019). 
 
Due to changes in mean surface wind speed patterns (Li et al., 2018a) and the poleward shift of the North 
Atlantic jet stream exit, mean surface wind speeds are projected to decrease in the Mediterranean areas under 
RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 by the middle of the century and beyond, or for global warming levels of 2 degrees and 
higher (high confidence), with a subsequent decrease in wind power potential (medium confidence) (Hueging 
et al., 2013; Tobin et al., 2015, 2018; Davy et al., 2018; Karnauskas et al., 2018a; Kjellström et al., 2018; 
Moemken et al., 2018) (see also Fig. 12.4). However, subregional patterns of change are present from 
regional climate models such as an increase in wind speeds in the Aegean Sea and in the northern Adriatic 
Sea where a reduction of Bora events and an increase of Scirocco events are projected for mid-century and 
beyond under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (medium confidence) (Tobin et al., 2016; Davy et al., 2018; Belušić 
Vozila et al., 2019). Projections (as cited above) also indicate a decrease in mean wind speed in Northern 
Europe (medium confidence, medium agreement) (Karnauskas et al., 2018a; Tobin et al., 2018; Jung and 
Schindler, 2019). Daily and interannual wind variability is projected to increase under RCP8.5 (only) 
Northern Europe (Moemken et al., 2018) (low confidence), which can influence electrical grid management 
and wind energy production (low confidence). Wind speeds are projected to shift towards more frequent 
occurrences below thresholds inhibiting wind power production (Weber et al., 2018). Wind stagnation events 
may become more frequent in future climate scenarios in some areas of Europe in the second half of the 21st 
century (Horton et al., 2014; Vautard et al., 2018), with potential consequences on air quality (low 
confidence). 
 
*Severe wind storm:* There are large uncertainties in past evolutions of windstorms and extreme winds in 
Europe. Extreme near-surface winds have been decreasing in the past decades (Smits et al., 2005; Tian et al., 
2019; Vautard et al., 2019) according to near-surface observations. Significant negative trends of cyclone 
frequency in spring and positive trends in summer have been found in the Mediterranean basin for the period 
1979-2008  (Lionello et al., 2016). By contrast increasing trands have been found in Arctic ocean areas 
(Wickström et al., 2020). These trends are not associated with significant trends in extratropical cyclones 
(Chapter 2), and are consistent with the mean wind decreasing trends.  
 
There is medium confidence that serial clustering of storms, inducing cumulated economic losses, in future 
climate will increase in many areas in Europe under climate projections over Europe (Karremann et al., 
2014; Economou et al., 2015). Strong winds and extra-tropical storms are projected to have a slightly 
increasing frequency and amplitude in the future in Northern, Western and central Europe (Outten and Esau, 
2013; Feser et al., 2015; Forzieri et al., 2016; Mölter et al., 2016; Ruosteenoja et al., 2019b; Vautard et al., 
2019) in RCP8.5 and SRES A1B by the end of the century (medium confidence), as well as off the European 
coasts (Martínez-Alvarado et al., 2018) due to the increase of intensity of extratropical storms at a 2°C global 
warming level or above (Zappa et al., 2013) in these areas. The frequency of storms, including Medicanes, is 
projected to decrease in Mediterranean regions, and their intensities are projected to increase, by the middle 
of the century and beyond for SRES A1B, A2 and RCP8.5 (medium confidence) (Nissen et al., 2014; Feser et 
al., 2015; Forzieri et al., 2016; Mölter et al., 2016; Tous et al., 2016; Romera et al., 2017; González‐Alemán 
et al., 2019) (MedECC, 2020)(Chapter 11). 

Projections of smaller-scale hazard phenomena such as tornadoes, wind gusts, hail storms and lightning are 
currently not directly available partly due to the inability of climate models to simulate such phenomena. 
Observational networks for such phenomena usually lack homogeneity over long climate periods, hindering 
clear trends to be detected. For instance, while no robust trends have been identified (Hermida et al., 2015; 
Mohr et al., 2015a; Burcea et al., 2016; Ćurić and Janc, 2016), hail storm environments (favourable 
atmospheric configurations) have increased in frequency (Sanchez et al., 2017) (low confidence, low 
evidence). In future climate periods it is more likely than not that severe convection environments will 
become more frequent by the end of the century under scenario RCP8.5 (Mohr et al., 2015b; Púčik et al., 
2017), and there is medium confidence that such environments become more frequent by the 2050s in 
scenario RCP4.5. There is no evidence for changes in tornado frequencies in Europe in the observations 
(Groenemeijer and Kühne, 2014) as well as in future climate projections. Insufficient observational record 
length for lightning numbers does not allow an assessment of trends. 
 
*There is high confidence that mean wind speeds will decrease in Mediterranean areas and medium 
confidence of such decreases in Northern Europe for global warming levels of 2°C or more and beyond 
the middle of the century. A slightly increased frequency and amplitude of extratropical cyclones, 
strong winds and extra-tropical storms is projected for Northern, Central and Western Europe by the 
middle of the century and beyond and for global warming levels of 2°C or more (medium confidence). 
The frequency of Medicanes is projected to decrease (medium confidence), but their intensity is 
projected to increase. Proxies of intense convection indicate that the large-scale conditions conducive 
to severe convection will tend to increase in the future climate (low confidence).* 
 
 
### 12.4.5.4  Snow and ice 
 
*Snow:* Widespread and accelerated declines of snow depth are currently observed in Europe (Fontrodona 
Bach et al., 2018) and snow water equivalent (Marty et al., 2017b) (see also Figures 12.9b) for a typical 
range of altitudes of higher settlement elevation and ski resorts. In the Pyrenees a slow snow cover decline 
has been observed starting from the industrial period with a sharp increase since 1955 (López-Moreno et al., 
2020). Under the RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenario the reliability elevation using snowmaking will rise 
of 200-300 m in the Alps and 400-600 in the Pyrenees by mid century. By end of century projections are 
highly dependent from the scenario being stationary for the RCP2.6 and continuously decreasing under the 
RCP8.5 up to not have anymore natural snow conditions for any of the locations in the French Alps and 
Pyrenees (Spandre et al., 2019). Similarly also Norway and Austria will see a rising of the natural snow 
elevation with consequences for the  ski season (Scott et al., 2020; Steiger and Scott, 2020). In the Alps, 
recent simulations project a reduction in Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) at 1500 m a.s.l. of 80–90% by 2100 
under the A1B scenario and a snow season that would start 2-4 weeks later and end 5-10 weeks earlier than 
in the 1992-2012 average (Schmucki et al., 2015), which is equivalent to a shift in elevation of about 700 m 
(Marty et al., 2017a). For elevations above 3000 m a.s.l., a decline in SWE of at least 10% is expected by the 
end of the century even when assuming the largest projected precipitation increase. Similar trends are 
observed for the Pyrenees and Scandinavia (López-Moreno et al., 2009; Räisänen and Eklund, 2012). For the 
Northern French Alps above 1500 m and the Ötztal locations in the Austrian alps SWE has a similar 
decreasing trend altitudinal dependent for all 3 scenarios (RCP2.6, RPC4.5 and RCP8.5) until mid of century 
and with significant differentiation among them in the second half of the century up to free snow condition 
for the RCP8.5 scenario (Hanzer et al., 2018; Verfaillie et al., 2018). 
 
*Glacier:* Observation and future projections of European glacier mass changes are assessed in Section 9.5.1 
grouped in two main regions: Scandinavia and Central Europe regions. It is virtually certain that glaciers 
will shrink in the future and there is medium confidence in the timing and mass change rates (Chapter 9). 
Central Europe is one of the regions where glaciers are projected to lose substantial mass even under low-
emission scenarios (Section 9.5.1.3) (MedECC, 2020). GlacierMIP projections indicate that glaciers in the 
Central Europe region lose 63 ± 31%, 80 ± 22% and 93 ± 13% of their 2015 mass by the end of the century 
for RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively (Marzeion et al., 2020). In those same scenarios, glaciers in 
Scandinavia are projected to lose 55 ± 33%, 66 ± 34% and 82 ± 24% of their 2015 mass. The virtually 
certain shrink in glaciers is bolstered by RCM simulations from the EURO-CORDEX ensemble, with the 
Global Glacier Evolution Model (GloGEM) indicating a substantial reduction of glacier ice volumes in the 
European Alps by 2050 (47–52% with respect to 2017 for RCP2.6, 4.5 and 8.5). Under RCP2.6, about two-
thirds (63 ± 11%) of the present-day (2017) ice volume is projected to be lost by 2100. In contrast, under the 
strong warming of RCP8.5, glaciers in the European Alps are projected to largely disappear by 2100 (94 ± 
4% volume loss compared to 2017; Zekollari et al., 2019). 
 
*Permafrost:* In Europe, permafrost is found in high mountains and in Scandinavia, as well as in Arctic 
Islands (e.g., Iceland, Novaya Zemlia or Svalbard). In recent decade permafrost has been lost (Chapter 9) 
and accelerated warming at high altitudes and latitudes has favored an increase of permafrost temperatures in 
the order of 0.2 ± 0.1°C between 2007 and 2016 (Romanovsky et al., 2018; Noetzli et al., 2019). Over the 
21st century, permafrost is very likely to undergo increasing thaw and degradation (Hock et al., 2019) and it is 
virtually certain that permafrost extent and volume with decrease with increase of global warming (Chapter 
9).  
 
Permafrost thawing is projected to affect the frequency and magnitude of high-mountain mass wasting 
processes (Stoffel and Huggel, 2012). The temporal frequency of periglacial debris flows in the Alps is 
unlikely to change significantly by the mid-21st century but is likely to decrease during the second part of the 
century, especially in summer (Stoffel et al., 2011, 2014; Lane et al., 2017). There is medium confidence that 
most of the Northern Europe periglacial processes will disappear by the end of the century, even in the 
RCP2.6 scenario (Aalto et al., 2017). The magnitude of debris flow events might increase (Lugon and 
Stoffel, 2010) (low confidence) and the debris-flow season may last longer in a warming climate (Stoffel and 
Corona, 2018) (medium confidence). Quantitative data for the European Alps is highly site dependent 
(Haeberli, 2013). 
 
*Heavy Snowfall, ice storms and hail:* There is low confidence that climate change will affect ice and snow 
episodic hazards (limited evidence). The change in snowpack in the Alps is expected to lead to a possible 
reduction in overall avalanche activity (low confidence), except possibly in winter and at high altitudes 
(Castebrunet et al., 2014).  
 
For ice storms, or freezing rainstorms, there is also limited evidence due to a limited number of studies. 
Heavy snowfalls have decreased in frequency in the past decades and this is expected to continue in the 
future climate (Beniston et al., 2018) (low confidence). Freezing rain is projected to increase in western, 
central and southern Europe (Kämäräinen et al., 2018) (low confidence). Rain-on-snow events, are 
decreasing in northern regions (Pall et al., 2019) and by 48% on average in southern Scandinavia (Poschlod 
et al., 2020) due to decreases in snowfall. 
 
*In summary, in the future snow cover extent and seasonal duration will reduce (high confidence) and 
it is virtually certain that glaciers will continue to shrink. A reduction of glacier ice volume is projected 
in the European Alps and Scandinavia (high confidence). There is high confidence that permafrost will 
undergo increasing thaw and degradation over the 21st century. Most of the Northern Europe 
periglacial will disappear by the end of the century even for a lower emissions scenario (medium 
confidence) and the debris-flow season may last longer in a warming climate (medium confidence).* 
 
 
### 12.4.5.5  Coastal and Oceanic 
 
*Relative sea level:* Around Europe, over 1900-2018, a new tide-gauge based reconstruction finds a regional-
mean RSL change of 1.08 [0.79 to 1.38] mm yr<sup>-1</sup> in the subpolar North Atlantic (Frederikse et al., 2020), 
compared to a GMSL change of around 1.7 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> (Section 2.3.3.3; Table 9.5). For the period 1993-2018, 
the RSLR rates, based on satellite altimetry, increased to 2.17 [1.66 to 2.66] mm yr<sup>-1</sup> (Frederikse et al., 
2020), compared to a GMSL change of 3.25 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> (Section 2.3.3.3; Table 9.5). 
 
Relative sea level rise is extremely likely to continue in the oceans around Europe. Regional-mean RSLR 
projections for the oceans around Europe range from 0.4 m–0.5 m under SSP1-RCP2.6 to 0.7 m–0.8 m under 
SSP5-RCP8.5 for 2081-2100 relative to 1995-2014 (median values), which means that there are locally large 
deviations from the projected GMSL change {Section 9.6.3.3}. These RSLR projections may however be 
underestimated due to potential partial representation of land subsidence in their assessment (Section 
9.6.3.2). The signal is strongest for the North Sea and Atlantic coasts, followed by the Black Sea. The Baltic 
Sea on the contrary shows the lowest increase due to land uplift (Vousdoukas et al., 2017). The model 
agreement is higher for the Mediterranean and in line with the previous findings by Gualdi et al. (2013). 
 
*Coastal flood:* The present day 1:100 yr ETWL is between 0.5-1.5m in the MED basin and 2.5-5.0 m in the 
western Atlantic European coasts, around the UK and along the North Sea coast, and lower at 1.5-2.5m 
along the Baltic Sea coast. (Kirezci et al 2020). Similar values are reported by Vousdoukas et al., (2018). 
 
There is high confidence that extreme total water level (ETWL) magnitude and occurrence frequency will 
increase throughout Europe (see Figure 12.4p-r), except in the northern Baltic Sea.  Across the region, the 5th 
– 95th percentile range of the 1:100 yr ETWL is projected to increase (relative to 1980 – 2014) by 4 cm – 40 
cm and by 6 cm – 47 cm by 2050 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. By 2100, this range is projected 
to be 6 cm – 88 cm and 25 cm – 186 cm under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively (Vousdoukas et al., 2018; 
Kirezci et al., 2020) (see Figure SM 12.6). Mass addition across the Gibraltar Strait may play a role even if 
this is quite unclear to which extent (Lionello et al., 2017). Furthermore, under RCP4.5,  the present day 
1:100 yr ETWL is projected to have median return periods of between 1:5 and 1:20 yrs by 2050 and occur 
once per year or more by 2100 in the Mediterranean and Black Sea, while in the rest of Europe it is mostly 
projected to have median return periods of between 1:20 yrs and 1:50 yrs by 2050 and between 1:5 yrs and 
1:20 yrs by 2100 (Vousdoukas et al., 2018). Under RCP8.5, occurrence of the present day 1:100 yr ETWL is 
projected to increase further to median return periods of 1:1 yr to 1:5 yrs by 2050 and occur more than once 
per year by 2100 in the Mediterranean and Black Sea, while in the rest of Europe it is mostly projected to 
have median return periods between 1:5 yrs and more than once per year by 2100.  
 
*Coastal erosion:* Satellite derived shoreline change estimates over 1984 – 2015 indicate shoreline retreat 
rates of around 0.5 m yr<sup>-1</sup> along the sandy coasts of CEU and MED, around 4 m yr<sup>-1</sup> in EEU (Caspian Sea 
region) and more or less stable shorelines in NEU (Luijendijk et al., 2018; Mentaschi et al., 2018). Mentaschi 
et al. (2018) report a coastal area loss of 270 km2 over a 30 year period (1984-2015) along the Atlantic 
coastlines of Europe.  
 
Projections indicate that sandy coasts throughout the continent (except those bordering the northern Baltic 
Sea) will experience shoreline retreat through the 21st century (high confidence). Median shoreline change 
projections (CMIP5) relative to 2010, show that, by mid-century, shorelines will retreat by between 25 m 
and 60 m along sandy coasts in CEU and MED under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (Vousdoukas et al., 2020; 
Athanasiou et al., 2020). Mid-century median projections for NEU indicate virtually no shoreline retreat 
under RCP4.5, but a retreat of around 40 m under RCP8.5. By 2100, median shoreline retreats of around 50 
m are projected in NEU and MED under RCP4.5, increasing to around 80 m under RCP8.5. End century 
median projections for CEU are far higher at 100 m (RCP4.5) and 160 m (RCP8.5). The total length of sandy 
coasts in Europe that is projected to retreat by more than a median of 100 m by 2100 under RCP4.5 and 
RCP8.5 is about 12,000 km and 18,000 km respectively, an increase of approximately 54% (Vousdoukas et 
al., 2020) 
 
Local assessments of both long term shoreline retreat and episodic coastal erosion are given by (Li et al., 
2013a; Toimil et al., 2017; Bon de Sousa et al., 2018; Le Cozannet et al., 2019). In terms of episodic coastal 
erosion, 31%–88% of all Aegean beaches are projected to experience complete erosion, with a RCP4.5 sea 
level rise of 0.5 m and a surge of 0.6 m, but with substantial uncertainty (Monioudi et al., 2017). 
 
*Marine heatwave:* The mean SST of the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean has increased between 
0.25°C and 1°C since 1982-1998. This mean ocean surface warming is correlated to longer and more 
frequent marine heatwaves in the region (Oliver et al., 2018). Over the period 1982-2016, the coastlines of 
Europe experienced on average more than 2.0 MHW per year, with the eastern Mediterranean and 
Scandinavia experiencing 2.5–3 MHWs per year. The average duration was between 10 and 15 days. 
Changes over the 20th century, derived from MHW proxies, show an increase in frequency of between 1.0 
and 2.0 MHWs per decade in Europe, although the trend is not statistically significant; with an increase in 
intensity per event in the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean, and a decrease in the Atlantic off the British 
Isles. The total number of MHW days per decade has increased in the Mediterranean (Oliver et al., 2018). 
 
Mean SST is projected to increase by 1 ºC to 3ºC around Europe by 2100, with a hotspot of around 4 ºC to 5 
ºC along the Arctic coastline of Europe under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios (see Interactive Atlas), leading 
to a continued increase in MHW frequency, magnitude and duration (Oliver et al., 2018; MedECC, 2020). 
Projections for SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 both show an increase in MHWs around Europe by 2081 – 2100, 
relative to 1985 – 2014 (Box 9.2, Figure 1). Darmaraki et al. (2019) project that, by the end of the 21st 
century and under RCP8.5, there will be one MHW occurring every year in the Northern Mediterranean sea, 
and that these MHWs would be 3 months longer, 4 times more intense, and 42 times more severe than 
present day MHWs in the region. Frölicher et al., (2018) show that, in Europe, the change in the probability 
for the number of days of MHWs exceeding the 99th percentile of the pre-industrial level is 4%, 15% and 
30% for global warming levels of 1oC, 2oC and 3.5oC, respectively. MHW increase in the Mediterranean will 
impact on many species that live in shallow waters and have reduced motility, with consequences for the 
related economic activities (Galli et al., 2017). 
 
*In general, there is high confidence that most coastal/ocean related climatic impact-drivers in Europe 
will increase over the 21st century for all scenarios and time horizons. Relative sea level rise is 
extremely likely to continue around Europe (except in the northern Baltic Sea), contributing to 
increased coastal flooding in low-lying areas and shoreline retreat along most sandy coasts (high 
confidence). Marine Heatwaves are also expected to increase around the region over the 21st century 
(high confidence).*
 
 
### 12.4.5.6  Other 
 
*Compound events.* One typical compound event that is observed in the European area is compound flooding 
due to the combination of extreme sea level events and extreme precipitation events associated with high 
level of runoff. In the present climate, the Mediterranean coasts are exposed to a higher probability of this 
type of compound flooding events (Bevacqua et al., 2019). Under RCP8.5, the probability of these events are 
projected to increase along northern European coasts (west coast of UK, northern France, the east and south 
coast of the North Sea, and the eastern half of the Black Sea) with the percentage of coastline currently 
experiencing such events with a return period lower than 6 years will increasing from 3% to 11% by the end 
of the 21st century (Bevacqua et al., 2019). 
 
Under RCP8.5, regions in Russia, France and Germany are projected to experience an increase in the 
frequency and the length of wet and cold compound events, while Spain and Bulgaria are projected to stay 
longer in the hot and dry state by mid-century (Sedlmeier et al., 2016). 
 
Compound events of dry and hot summers have increased in Europe. (Manning et al., 2019) found that the 
probability of such compound events has increased across much of Europe between 1950–1979 and 1984–
2013, notably in southern, eastern and western Europe. Compound hot and dry extremes are projected to 
increase in Europe by mid-century for the SRES A1B and RCP8.5  but a particularly strong signal is 
projected in southern and eastern Germany and the Czech Republic (Sedlmeier et al., 2016). 
 
 
The assessed direction of change in climatic impact-drivers for Europe and associated confidence levels are 
illustrated in Table 12.7, together with emergence time information (see Section 12.5.2). No assessable 
literature could be found for Sand and dust storms, although these phenomena may be relevant in parts of the 
region.

## 12.4.6  North America 
 
Major changes in North American CIDs were assessed in WGII AR5 Chapter 26 (Romero-Lankao et al., 
2014), with additional detail on connections to warming levels provided by SR1.5 (IPCC, 2018), and climate 
information related to land degradation and land use suitability in SRCCL (IPCC, 2019c), and ocean and 
coastal hazards in the SROCC (IPCC, 2019b). Recent national assessments in the United States (USGCRP, 
2017, 2018) and Canada (Bush and Lemmen, 2019) enhance the local perspective and assessments across a 
number of CIDs and their sectoral connections. For the purpose of this assessment, North America is sub-
divided into six sub-regions as defined in Chapter 1: Central North America (CNA), Western North America 
(WNA), Central North America (CAN), Eastern North America (ENA), Northeast North America (NEN), 
and Northwest North America (NWN). Greenland and Arctic regions of Northeast and Northwest North 
America are further assessed in 12.4.9, and the Caribbean and Hawaiian Islands are assessed in 12.4.7.

### 12.4.6.1  Heat and cold 
 
*Mean air temperature:*  Section Atlas.9.2 assessed very likely mean warming in observations across North 
America with highest increases at higher latitudes and in the winter season. Section Atlas.9.4 assessed very 
likely mean warming in future decades in all North American regions, with CMIP and CORDEX models 
showing median increases exceeding 2℃ in much of the continental interior under RCP8.5 (2041-2060 
compared to 1995-2014) and higher increases toward the north. Mean temperatures at the end of century 
show strong scenario dependence, rising between 1°C and 2.5℃ in RCP2.6 and about 4 to 8℃ in RCP8.5 
(Figures Atlas.15, Atlas.32, Atlas.33). Warming also raises stream temperatures across the continent (DOE, 
2015; Trtanj et al., 2016; van Vliet et al., 2016; Chapra et al., 2017), and Hill et al. (2014) projected US 
stream warming by 0.6°C (±0.3°C) per 1°C increase in local air temperature. Mean warming drives shifts in 
the seasonal timing of temperature thresholds, including increasing growing degree-days (Mu et al., 2017), 
longer growing seasons (Gowda et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018b; Vincent et al., 2018c), reduced chill hours 
(Luedeling, 2012; Lee and Sumner, 2015; Xie et al., 2015; Parker and Abatzoglou, 2019), and longer pollen 
and allergy seasons (Fann et al., 2016; Anenberg et al., 2017; Sapkota et al., 2019). Warmer temperatures 
will very likely reduce heating degree days and increase cooling degree days (Bartos et al., 2016; US EPA, 
2016; Craig et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019c; Coppola et al., 2021b).  
 
*Extreme heat:*  Section 11.9 assessed that extreme temperatures in North America have increased in recent 
decades (medium evidence, medium agreement) other than Central and Eastern North America (low 
confidence), and extreme heat in all regions is projected to increase with climate change (high confidence).  
Observed trends in extreme heat are more positive for heat extreme indices that include temperature and 
humidity given historical expansion of irrigation and intensification of agriculture (Mueller et al., 2017; 
Grotjahn and Huynh, 2018; Thiery et al., 2020). Several studies noted statistically significant increases in 
intensity and particularly the frequency, duration, and seasonal length of the physiologically-hazardous 
extreme heat conditions across North American (Grineski et al., 2015; Habeeb et al., 2015; Martínez-Austria 
et al., 2016; Petitti et al., 2016; Vincent et al., 2018c; García-Cueto et al., 2019).  
 
Figure 12.4b shows over a month of additional days at CMIP6 SSP5-8.5 mid-century where temperatures 
exceed 35°C across much of southern Mexico and regions near the US-Mexico border and these extreme 
temperatures occur at least once per year up to southern Canada. (Coppola et al., 2021b) found similar 
patterns in CMIP5 and CORDEX-Core. Using locally-tailored heat thresholds, Maxwell et al. (2018) found 
that “very hot” days in 5 US cities will occur a median of 3 to 5 times more often by RCP8.5 2036-2065 (2 
to 3.5x in RCP4.5), Oleson et al. (2018) projected that annual heatwave duration will exceed one month in 
Houston in RCP8.5 2061-2080, and Anderson et al. (2018) projected 7 to 12 times more exceedances of 
thresholds associated with high-mortality in RCP8.5 2061-2080 (6 to 7x in RCP4.5). (Schwingshackl et al., 
2021) found that Central and Eastern North America are among the regions with the strongest trend in heat 
stress indicators. Studies also project increasingly surpassed heat extreme thresholds for North American 
crops (Gourdji et al., 2013), airplane weight restrictions (Coffel et al., 2017), and peak load energy systems 
(Auffhammer et al., 2017). 
 
The number of days crossing dangerous heat thresholds such as HI>41°C will be very sensitive to the 
mitigation scenario at the end of century (Wuebbles et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2015; Dahl et al., 2019; 
Schwingshackl et al., 2021). At the end of the century under SSP5-8.5, a CMIP6 median increase of 
exceedances of 75-150 days per year is projected over much of North Central America, Central North 
America and the U.S. Southwest while this increase is projected to remain limited below 60 days under 
SSP1-2.6 (Figure 12.4d,f and Figure SM 1.2). Steinberg et al. (2018) also projected more frequent and longer 
‘heat-health’ events in California extending into October.  
 
*Cold spell:*  Chapter 11 assessed high confidence in decreasing frequency and intensity of cold spells over 
North America (Section 11.9).  The number of days with extreme wind chill hours (humidex<-30) decreased 
at 76% of examined Canadian stations from 1953-2012 (Mekis et al., 2015) and cold days and coldest nights 
decreased in Mexico from 1980-2010 (García-Cueto et al., 2019). 
 
Cold spells are projected to decrease over North America under climate change, with the largest decreases 
most common in the winter season (high confidence) (Section 11.9). Minimum winter temperatures are  
projected to rise faster than the mean wintertime temperature (Underwood et al., 2017) and alter cold 
hardiness zones used to determine agricultural suitability (Parker and Abatzoglou, 2016). Wuebbles et al. 
(2014) projections for RCP8.5 end-of-century found that the 4-day cold spell that happens on average once 
every 5 years is projected to warm by more than 10 ºC and CMIP5 models do not project current 1-in-20 
year annual minimum temperature extremes to recur over much of the continent. Multiple studies have 
shown that Arctic warming can alter large-scale variability and change the frequency and duration of mid-
latitude cold air outbreaks, potentially leading to increasing cold hazards in some regions (Barcikowska et 
al., 2019; Cohen et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2021) (low agreement).  
 
*Frost:*  An expansion of the frost-free season is underway and projections for North America indicate a 
continuation of this trend in the future (high confidence). Significant decreases in frost days, consecutive 
frost days, and ice days were identified in 1948-2016 station observations across Canada, along with a 
resulting lengthening of the frost-free season by more than a month in many regions (Vincent et al., 2018c). 
Frost days also declined in nearly all Mexican cities from 1980-2010 (García-Cueto et al., 2019), and a 1917-
2016 decline of about 3 weeks in frigid winter conditions challenges ecosystems in the Northeast US and 
Southeast Canada (Contosta et al., 2020). Studies connect projections of a longer frost-free season in North 
America to a longer outdoor construction season, orchard production, and weight restrictions on runways  
(Daniel et al., 2018; DeGaetano, 2018; Jacobs et al., 2018). Frosts are projected to persist as an episodic 
hazard in many regions given natural variability and cold air outbreaks even as mean temperature rises (high 
confidence). 
 
*Climate change is virtually certain to shift the balance of temperature toward warming trends and 
away from cold extremes, with increases in the magnitude, frequency, duration and seasonal and 
spatial extent of heat extremes driving impacts across North America. There is a particular sensitivity 
to scenario pathway in resulting changes to the frequency of exceeding dangerous heat thresholds such 
as HI>41°C in NCA, CNA and the US Southwest, with 75-150 days more under SSP5-8.5 but less than 
60 days more under SSP1-2.6 in the end of the century.*  
 
 
### 12.4.6.2  Wet and dry 
 
*Mean precipitation:*  Atlas.9.2 found that trends in annual precipitation over 1960–2015 are generally non-
significant though there are consistent positive trends over parts of ENA and CNA, together with significant 
decreases in precipitation in parts of south-western US and north-western Mexico. 
 
Atlas.9.4 assessed very high confidence in increases in precipitation over most of Northern and Eastern 
North America, with medium confidence of decrease over Northern Central America and low confidence 
elsewhere (see Figure Atlas.33, Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1 Figure 1). Changes are most dramatic in the 
Spring and Winter, when wet conditions are projected to extend from the northern portions of the continent 
as far south as the central Great Plains while Mexico becomes drier; in contrast, summertime changes are 
uncertain across most of the continent other than wetter conditions in Northern Canada (Easterling et al., 
2017; Bukovsky and Mearns, 2020; Teichmann et al., 2020; Almazroui et al., 2021) . 
 
*River flood:* There is limited evidence and low agreement on observed climate change influences for river 
floods in North America (see also Section 11.5). Trends in streamflow indices are mixed and difficult to 
separate from river engineering influences, with large changes but little spatial coherence across the US, 
making it difficult to identify trends with confidence (Villarini and Slater; Peterson et al., 2013; Mallakpour 
and Villarini, 2015; Archfield et al., 2016; Wehner et al., 2017; Hodgkins et al., 2019; Neri et al., 2019). 
There is high confidence in historical shifts in the timing of peak streamflow toward higher winter and earlier 
spring flows in snowmelt-driven basins in Canada (Burn and Whitfield, 2016; Bonsal et al., 2019) and the 
United States (Dudley et al., 2017; Wehner et al., 2017). Some rivers show ice-jam floods occurring a week 
earlier, but changes are mixed given localized positive and negative changes across the continent (Rokaya et 
al., 2018). There is medium confidence that climate change will increase river floods over the United States 
and Canada but low confidence for changes in Mexico.  Wobus et al. (2017a) used a regional hydrologic 
model for 57000 streams to project more than a doubling in the frequency of current 100 yr flow events in 
many portions of the United States for RCP8.5 2050 with additional contributions from earlier snowmelt. 
CMIP6 projections for SSP5-8.5 2065-2099 show strongest peak United States runoff increases in the East 
(Villarini and Zhang, 2020); however, several studies applying global hydrological models disagree with 
regional streamflow projections, indicating a decrease in the magnitude or frequency of floods over a large 
portion of North America (e.g., Hirabayashi et al., 2013; Arnell and Gosling, 2016) (Figure 12.10a,c). 
 
*Heavy precipitation and pluvial flood:*  Section 11.4 assessed high confidence in observed increases in 
extreme precipitation events (including hourly totals) in Central and Eastern North America with low 
confidence in broad trends elsewhere in the continent despite observational increases in some portions of 
each region (Vincent et al., 2018c; García-Cueto et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019c).    
 
Section 11.4 found that high precipitation is projected to increase across North America (high confidence) 
except for portions of Western North America where projections are mixed (medium confidence of increase).  
Maxwell et al. (2018) identified regional “heavy precipitation day” thresholds for 5 cities across the US and 
projected that a tripling (or more) of these events is possible by RCP8.5 mid-century. Projections indicate 
changes to intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves typically used for construction design and automobile 
hazards, as well as increases in the 10 year recurrence level of 24 hour rainfall intensities that challenge 
storm water drainage systems (Hambly et al., 2013; Cheng and AghaKouchak, 2015; Neumann et al., 2015b; 
Prein et al., 2017b; Hettiarachchi et al., 2018; Ragno et al., 2018).  Precise levels of regional IDF 
characteristics may still depend substantially on the method and resolution of downscaling applied 
(DeGaetano and Castellano, 2017; Cook et al., 2020b).  
 
*Landslide:*  There is growing but yet limited evidence for unique climate-driven changes in landslide and 
rockfall hazards in North America, even as theory suggests decreases in slope and rockface stability due to 
more intense rainfall, rain-on-snow events, mean warming, permafrost thaw, glacier retreat, and coastal 
erosion (Cloutier et al., 2017; Coe et al., 2018; Handwerger et al., 2019; Hock et al., 2019; Patton et al., 
2019) although dry trends can decelerate mass movements (Bennett et al., 2016). Landslide frequency has 
likely increased in British Columbia (Geertsema et al., 2006) and is expected to increase in Northwest North 
America given the combination of these factors (medium confidence) (Gariano and Guzzetti, 2016). Cloutier 
et al. (2017) projected an increase in landslides in Western Canada due to wetter overall conditions and 
reduced return period for extreme rainfall. Robinson et al. (2017) used scenarios based upon projection of 50 
yr recurrence of 7 d precipitation periods to highlight the potential for increased landslide hazards near 
Seattle. Broad US projections are more uncertain given increases in evapotranspiration that will counteract 
precipitation changes over much of the country (Coe, 2016).   
 
*Aridity:*  Chapter 8 showed that aridity in North America generally moves opposite to mean precipitation 
change with an added evaporative demand from warmer temperatures (high confidence in aridity increase for 
North Central America, medium confidence increase in Central North America; high confidence decrease in 
Northeast North America, medium confidence decrease in Eastern and Northwest North America; see also 
Section 11.9). Projected soil moisture declines (Figure 12.4j-l) are most widespread across North America 
during the summertime, with largest declines in Mexico and the southern Great Plains but also extending 
into Canada (Section 8.4.1.6; Swain and Hayhoe, 2015; Easterling et al., 2017; Bonsal et al., 2019; Lu et al., 
2019). Yoon et al. (2018) found net reduction in southern Great Plains groundwater storage in RCP8.5 mid-
century projections despite increases in mean precipitation and both wet and dry extremes. Soil moisture 
drying could reach unprecedented levels by the CMIP6 RCP8.5 end of century, even when evaluating deeper 
soil columns relevant for crop rooting depth (Cook et al., 2020a). Projected changes in the aridity index 
portray a shift the geographic range of temperate drylands northward and eastward in Central and Western 
North America (Schlaepfer et al., 2017; Seager et al., 2018) which also diminishes aquifer recharge rates in 
the southern Great Plains and in some Western regions where snowpack is reduced (Meixner et al., 2016).  
 
*Hydrological drought:* Section 11.9 asssessed low confidence of significant observational trends and 
projected future changes in the characteristics of episodic hydrological drought in North America given 
limited evidence and low agreement in modeled changes.  Zhao et al. (2020) found that increases in 
hydrological drought frequency (particularly the 100 yr drought) were far more prevalent than for 
meteorological drought across 5797 watersheds in the US and Canada, indicating a strong influence of 
evaporative demand.  Reductions in the overall supply of meltwater from a declining snowpack also increase 
the potential for intermittent hydrological droughts in the Western US (Mote et al., 2018; Livneh and 
Badger, 2020).  
 
*Agricultural and ecological drought:* Section 11.9 assessed medium confidence for an increase in 
agricultural and ecological drought in Western North America but otherwise found limited evidence for 
broadly observed changes in North American agricultural and ecological drought even as increasing 
evaporative demand intensified vegetation stress and soil moisture deficits in recent events (Sections 11.6, 
11.9).  Section 11.9 asssessed medium confidence for more intense agricultural and ecological drought 
conditions over North Central America, Western North America and Central North America in a 2℃ global 
warming level (about mid-century), with medium confidence extending to Eastern North America and high 
confidence for North Central America and Central North America under a 4℃ global warming level 
associated with higher emissions scenarios past 2050.  Figure 12.4g-i shows that the frequency of 
meteorological droughts (which often initiate hydrological, agricultural and ecological  drought) is largely 
projected to increase in North American areas where total precipitation decreases (and vice versa; see 
Section 11.9 and Coppola et al., 2021b), and higher evaporative demand will extend the regions where more 
intense ecological and agricultural droughts develop when meteorological droughts occur (Wehner et al., 
2017; Cook et al., 2019).  Studies utilizing a variety of drought indices and soil moisture projections 
consistently project increased drought extending from Mexico into the southern Canadian Plains during the 
summer (Swain and Hayhoe, 2015; Ahmadalipour et al., 2017; Feng et al., 2017; Bonsal et al., 2019; Tam et 
al., 2019; Cook et al., 2020a).   
 
*Fire weather:* Climatic conditions conducive to wildfire have increased in Mexico, Western and Northwest 
North America, essentially due to warming (high confidence). Abatzoglou and Williams (2016) found 
climate changes led to higher values for 8 fuel aridity indices over the Western US in recent decades, with 
2000-2015 changes exposing 75% more forested area to high fuel aridity and adding 9 more high fire 
potential days each year, similar to 1979-2013 Western US and Mexico fire season expansion in Jolly et al., 
2015).  Increases in lightning-initiated fires have been distinguished from trends in man-made fire in 
Western Canada and the United States (Balch et al., 2017; Hanes et al., 2019). Jain et al. (2017) identified a 
1979-2015 expansion in fire weather season in Eastern Canada and the southwestern United States (with a 
smaller reduction in the northern mountain West) along with regional shifts in the 99th percentile Canadian 
Fire Weather Index (FWI) and potential fire spread days.  Girardin and Wotton (2009) noted that 1951-2002 
trends in the Monthly Drought Code fire index in Eastern Canada could hardly be distinguished from decadal 
variability. 
  
Climate change drives future increases in North American fire weather, particularly in the Southwest (high 
confidence), although shifts in exposure and vulnerability are needed to understand overall fire risks (see 
WGII Chapter 14). A significant increase of FWI is apparent before RCP8.5 2050 in much of North 
America, including the frequency of 95th percentile FWI days, peak seasonal FWI average, fire weather 
season length, and maximum fire weather index (Abatzoglou et al., 2019), and fire season across North 
America expands dramatically beyond 2℃ global warming levels (Sun et al., 2019b; Jain et al., 2020). Wang 
et al. (2017) simulated fire spread days across Canada and found median increases by 2071-2100 of -20 to 
140% (RCP2.6), -20 to 250% (RCP4.5) and 40 to 360% (RCP8.5) compared to 1976-2015. Prestemon et al. 
(2016) found more conducive conditions for lightning-ignited fires in the Southeastern US by mid-century, 
while warming conditions in Alaska increasingly push July temperatures above 13.4 ºC, a threshold for fire 
danger across Alaska’s tundra and boreal forest (Partain et al., 2016; Young et al., 2017). Longer and more 
intense fire seasons would also raise particulate matter and black carbon concentrations in the Western 
United States, reducing visibility at many National Parks (Yue et al., 2013; Val Martin et al., 2015). 
 
*Changes in North American wet and dry climatic impact-drivers are largely organized by the 
northeast (more wet) to southwest (more dry) pattern of mean precipitation change, although heavy 
precipitation increases are widespread and increasing evaporative demand expands aridity, 
agricultural and ecological drought, and fire weather (particularly in summertime) (high confidence).* 
 
 
### 12.4.6.3  Wind 
 
*Mean wind speed:*  Mean wind speeds have declined in past decades in North America as in other Northern 
Hemisphere areas over the past four decades (AR5, WGI) (medium confidence) with a reversal in the last 
decade (low confidence) not fully consistent across studies (Tian et al., 2019; Zeng et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 
2019d) (Chapter 2). Tian et al. (2019) found a corresponding reduction in the wind power potential across 
the eastern parts of North America. 
 
Mean wind speeds are expected to decline over much of North America (Figure 12.4m-o), but the only broad 
signal of consistent change across model types is a reduction in wind speed in Western North America (high 
confidence). These declines reduce wind power endowment by 2050 and as early as the 2020-2040 near-term 
period in the US Mountain West, while there is disagreement between global and regional model change 
projections in the upper and lower Great Plains, Ohio River Valley, Mexico and Eastern Canada (Karnauskas 
et al., 2018a; Jung and Schindler, 2019; Chen, 2020). 
 
*Severe wind storm:*  There is limited evidence and low agreement in observed changes in North American 
CID indices associated with extratropical cyclones (Chapter 11), severe thunderstorms, severe wind bursts 
(derechos), tornadoes, or lightning strikes (Vose et al., 2014; Easterling et al., 2017; Kossin et al., 2017). 
Observational studies have indicated a reduction in the number of tornado days in the US, but increases in 
outbreaks with 30 or more tornados in one day (Brooks et al., 2014), the density of tornado clusters (Elsner 
et al., 2015), and overall tornado power (Elsner et al., 2019). 
 
There is medium confidence of a general decrease in the number of extratropical cyclones producing high 
wind speeds in North America, except over northernmost parts, for a global warming level of 2°C or by the 
end of the century in under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (Kumar et al., 2015; Jeong and Sushama, 2018; Li et al., 
2018a).  GCMs cannot directly resolve tornadoes and severe thunderstorms, however projections of 
favorable environments for severe storms (based on convective available potential energy and wind shear) 
indicate medium confidence for more severe storms and a longer convective storm season in the United 
States weaker increases extending north and east (Seeley and Romps, 2015; Glazer et al., 2020) and a 
corresponding increase in fall and winter tornadic storms (Brooks, 2013a; Diffenbaugh et al., 2013; Brooks 
et al., 2014) (see also Section 11.7.1). Prein et al. (2017a) used a convection-permitting model to project a 
tripling of mesoscale convective systems over the United States for end-of-century RCP8.5. 
 
*Tropical cyclone:* Section 11.7.1 identified recent reductions in tropical cyclone translation speed and higher 
tropical cyclone rainfall totals over the North Atlantic as well as substantial natural variability.  Projections 
indicate low confidence in change in North Atlantic tropical cyclone numbers, but medium confidence in 
Mexico and the US Gulf and Atlantic coasts for more intense storms with higher wind, precipitation, and 
storm surge totals when they do occur (Diro et al., 2014; DOE, 2015; Walsh et al., 2016a; Kossin et al., 
2017; Marsooli et al., 2019; Ting et al., 2019; Knutson et al., 2020) (see Section 11.7.1). A more rapid 
intensification of tropical cyclone winds and destructive power also heightens the tropical cyclone hazard 
(Bhatia et al., 2019). Greenhouse gas forcing is projected to shift tropical cyclones poleward (Kossin et al., 
2016), while also holding the potential for higher precipitation totals (Risser and Wehner, 2017; Knutson et 
al., 2020) particularly given evidence that storms increasingly stall near North American coastlines (Hall and 
Kossin, 2019). 
 
*Sand and dust storm:*  Land use change has increased dust emission in the western U.S. in the past 200 
years (Neff et al., 2008). However, there is medium confidence for observed increases in Western North 
American sand and dust storm activity since 1980. In their study of Valley Fever spread, Tong et al. (2017) 
identified a rapid intensification of dust storm activity using PM10 and PM2.5 observations from 1980-2011 
across 29 monitoring sites in the Southwestern US, similar to contiguous US observations by Brahney et al. 
(2013). Hand et al. (2016) attributed the earlier onset of spring dusts in the Southwest in large part to the 
Pacific Decadal Oscillation, however. The increasing trend in dust since the 1990s in the southwest US can 
be explained by precipitation deficit and surface bareness (Pu and Ginoux, 2018). Projections of future sand 
and dust storms over North America are based on aridity as a primary proxy for conducive conditions which 
lends medium confidence of an increase over Mexico and the Southwest US. Pu and Ginoux (2017) project 
about 5 more dusty days in spring and summer in the southern Great Plains under RCP8.5 at the end of the 
century, while dusty days decrease in northern regions where mean precipitation tends toward wetter 
conditions. 
 
*Tropical cyclones, severe wind and dust storms in North America are shifting toward more extreme 
characteristics, with a stronger signal toward heightened intensity than increased frequency, although 
specific regional patterns are more uncertain (medium confidence).  Mean wind speed and wind power 
potential are projected to decrease in Western North America (medium confidence) with differences 
between global and regional models lending low confidence elsewhere.* 
 
 
### 12.4.6.4  Snow and ice 
 
*Snow:* The seasonal extent of snow cover has reduced over North America in recent decades (robust 
evidence, high agreement) (see also Section 2.3.2.2, Section 9.5.3 and Atlas). The average North America 
area covered by snow decreased at a rate of about 8500 km2 per year over the 1972-2015 period, reducing 
the average snow cover season by two weeks primarily due to earlier spring melt (US EPA, 2016).  
Observations indicate earlier spring snowpack melting (Dudley et al., 2017) and a reduction in end-of-season 
snowpack metrics important to water resources over the Rockies (particularly since 1980) and Pacific 
Northwest (Pederson et al., 2013; Kormos et al., 2016; Kunkel et al., 2016; Fyfe et al., 2017; Mote et al., 
2018).  In situ measurements in Canada show more heterogenous trends in snow amount and density (Brown 
et al., 2019).      
 
Climate change is expected to reduce the total snow amount and the length of the snow cover season over 
most of North America, with a corresponding decrease in the proportion of total precipitation falling as snow 
and a reduction in end-of-season snowpack (high confidence) (see Atlas.9). Changes include a reduction in 
days with snowfall in all but Northern Canada (Danco et al., 2016; McCrary and Mearns, 2019), a delay of 
about a week in first snowfall in the US West in RCP8.5 2050 (Pierce and Cayan, 2013), and more 
prominent reductions in Canadian snow cover in the October-December period (Mudryk et al., 2018). 
Reduced total snowpack and earlier snowmelt lower dry season streamflow (Kormos et al., 2016; Rhoades et 
al., 2018). Figure 12.10b shows a reduction in days suitable for skiing (SWE>10 cm; Wobus et al., 2017b) 
across the US and Southern Canada, although some portions of Northern Central Canada see an increase. 
 
*Glacier:* Section 9.5.1 assessed that glaciers in Alaska, Western Canada and the Western United States are 
expected to continue to lose mass and areal extent (high confidence).  Compared to their 2015 state, glaciers 
in the Western Canada and the United States region will lose 62 ± 30%, 75 ± 29% and 85 ± 23%, of their 
mass by the end of the century for RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively (Marzeion et al., 
2020). Meanwhile glaciers in Alaska will lose 26 ± 21%, 31 ± 24% and 44 ± 27%, of their mass in 2015 
under the same scenarios.  The overall loss of glacial mass can act as a meltwater supply for freshwater 
resources, although this is expected to peak in the middle of the century and then fade as glaciers disappear 
(Fyfe et al., 2017; Derksen et al., 2018). Continued shrinkage of glaciers is projected to create further glacial 
lakes (medium confidence) similar to those that have led to outburst floods in Alaska and Canada (Carrivick 
and Tweed, 2016; Harrison et al., 2018).   
 
*Permafrost:* Warmer ground temperatures are expected to extend the geographical extent and depth of 
permafrost thaw across northern North America (very high confidence) (see also Section 9.5.2). Observations 
across Canada show that permafrost temperature is increasing and the active layer is getting thicker  (Chapter 
2.3.2.5; Biskaborn et al., 2019; Derksen et al., 2019; Romanovsky et al., 2020). Slater and Lawrence (2013) 
note that end-of-century RCP8.5 in North America only has shallow permafrost as the most probable 
condition in the Canadian Archipelago. Melvin et al. (2017) noted the loss of shallow permafrost in 5 
RCP8.5 CMIP5 models across a wide swath of southern Alaska by 2050 along with increases of active layer 
thickness. There is high confidence in continued reductions in mountain near-surface permafrost area with 
high spatial variability given local snow and temperature changes (Chapter 9.5.2; Peng et al., 2018; Hock et 
al., 2019). 
 
*Lake, river and sea ice:*  Anthropogenic warming reduces the seasonal extent of lake and river ice over 
many North American freshwater systems, with ice-free winter conditions pushing further north with rising 
temperatures (high confidence). Observations in Central and Eastern North America show reduced average 
seasonal lake ice cover duration (Benson et al., 2012; Mason et al., 2016; US EPA, 2016). Satellite 
observations show declines in lake ice (Du et al., 2017) and loss of more than 20% of winter river ice length 
in much of Alaska (2008-2018 compared to 1984-1994; Yang et al., 2020).  Spring lake and river ice in 
Canada is projected to break up 10-25 days earlier while fall freeze-up occurs 5-15 days later by mid-
century, with larger declines in lake ice season by the coasts (Dibike et al., 2012) and for rivers in the 
Rockies and Northeastern United States (Yang et al., 2020a) although global models have difficulty with 
frozen freshwater system dynamics (Derksen et al., 2018). Substantial ice loss is projected over the 
Laurentian Great Lakes (Hewer and Gough, 2019; Matsumoto et al., 2019). The southern extent of lakes 
experiencing intermittent winter ice cover moves northward with rising temperature, pushing nearly out of 
the continental United States at low elevations when GMT increases by 4.5℃ (Sharma et al., 2019). Higher 
spring flows and the potential for winter thaws are also projected to heighten the threat of ice jams (Rokaya 
et al., 2018; Bonsal et al., 2019) while reducing the seasonal viability of ice roads and recreational use 
(Pendakur, 2016; Mullan et al., 2017; Knoll et al., 2019).   
 
Seasonal sea ice coverage along the majority of Canadian and Alaskan coastlines is declining (robust 
evidence, high agreement) and there is high confidence that hazards associated with a loss of sea ice increase 
under climate change, as further assessed in Section 12.4.9.   
 
*Heavy snowfall:*  There is low agreement (limited evidence) for observed changes in heavy snowfall in 
North America. Kluver and Leathers (2015) noted a 1930-2008 frequency increase for all snow intensities in 
the Northern Great Plains but declines in heavier snow events in the Pacific Northwest and declines in the 
Southeastern US. Changnon (2018) found that most extreme 30-day high snowfall periods in the 1900-2016 
record over the Eastern US occurred in the 1959-1987 period that lies between the Dust Bowl and recent 
warming. There is low agreement and medium evidence for broad projected changes to heavy snowfall over 
North America given increased heavy precipitation and warmer winter temperatures. Several recent regional 
studies have projected that low-intensity events decrease more rapidly than heavy snowfall events, resulting 
in an increase in the snowfall proportion from heavy snowfall events even as the number of such events 
decreases (O’Gorman, 2014; Lute et al., 2015; Zarzycki, 2016; Janoski et al., 2018; Ashley et al., 2020)  
 
*Ice storm:*  There is limited evidence in the literature of unique changes in ice storms observed or projected 
over North America.  Groisman et al. (2016) examined 40 years of observations and found weak decreases in 
freezing rain events over the Southeastern US in the most recent decade. Ning and Bradley (2015) project 
that the average snow-rain transition line, which is associated with mixed precipitation, moves 2˚ latitude 
northward over Eastern North America by the end of the 21st century under RCP4.5 (4˚under RCP8.5) (see 
also Klima and Morgan, 2015)..   
 
*Hail:*  There is limited evidence and low agreement for observed changes in the frequency or intensity of 
North American hail storms. Allen et al., (2015) and Allen (2018) found that temporal inconsistencies in the 
US and Canadian hail records made long-term climate analysis difficult, although Tang et al. (2019) 
identified increasing environments conducive for hail ≥ 5 cm over the Central and Eastern United States. 
There is limited evidence and medium agreement in projections of increased hail damage potential over 
North America. Some regional and convective-permitting model projections indicate a longer hail season 
with fewer events and larger hail sizes that result in higher hail damage potential (Brimelow et al., 2017; 
Trapp et al., 2019).  
 
*Snow avalanche:*  There is limited evidence of directional changes in snow avalanches over North America. 
Mock and Birkeland (2000) identified a 1969-1995 decrease in snow avalanches over the Western United 
States, although they note the heavy influence of natural variability. A similar decline was observed over 
Western Canada (Bellaire et al., 2016; Sinickas et al., 2016), but clear trends are difficult to discern given 
sparse observations and shifts in avalanche management.  We concur with the SROCC assessment of  
medium confidence and high agreement that snow avalanche hazards generally decrease at low elevations 
given lower snowpack even as high elevations are increasingly susceptible to wet snow avalanches (Hock et 
al., 2019; see also Lazar and Williams, 2008).   
 
*Observations and projections agree that snow and ice CIDs over North America are characterized by 
reduction in glaciers and the seasonality of snow and ice formation, loss of shallow permafrost, and 
shifts in the rain/snow transition line that alters the seasonal and geographic range of snow and ice 
conditions in the coming decades (very high confidence).* 
 
 
### 12.4.6.5  Coastal and oceanic 
 
*Relative sea level:* Chapter 9 found that observations indicate increasing sea levels along most North 
American coasts (robust evidence, high agreement), although there is substantial regional variation in 
relative sea level rise (robust evidence, high agreement). Around North America, over 1900-2018, a new 
tide-gauge based reconstruction finds a regional-mean RSL change of 1.08 [0.79-1.38] mm yr<sup>-1</sup>  in the 
subpolar North Atlantic, 2.49 [1.89-3.06] mm yr<sup>-1</sup>  in the subtropical North Atlantic, and 1.20 [0.76-1.62] in 
the East Pacific (Frederikse et al., 2020), compared to a GMSL change of around 1.7 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> (Section 
2.3.3.3; Table 9.5). For the period 1993-2018, these RSLR rates, based on satellite altimetry, increased to 
2.17 [1.66-2.66] mm yr<sup>-1</sup>, 4.04 [2.77-5.24] mm yr<sup>-1</sup> and 2.35 [0.70-4.06] mm yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively (Frederikse et 
al., 2020), compared to a GMSL change of 3.25 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> (Section 2.3.3.3; Table 9.5). Relative sea level 
(RSL) is falling in portions of southern Alaska (Sweet et al., 2018) and much of northern Northeastern 
Canada and around Hudson Bay (where land is rising by >10 mm/year; Greenan et al., 2019). 
 
Relative sea-level rise is virtually certain to continue in the oceans around North America, except in northern 
Northeastern Canada and potions of Southern Alaska. Regional-mean RSLR projections for the oceans 
around North America range from 0.4 m -1.0 m under SSP1-RCP2.6 to 0.7 m -1.4 m under SSP5-RCP8.5 for 
2081-2100 relative to 1995-2014 (median values), which means that there are locally large deviations from 
the projected GMSL change {Section 9.6.3.3}, including decreases in RSL in northern Northeastern Canada 
from land uplift (see also Sweet et al., 2017; Greenan et al., 2019; Oppenheimer et al., 2019). The RSLR 
projections here may however be underestimated due to potential partial representation of land subsidence in 
their assessment (Section 9.6.3.2). 
 
*Coastal flood:*  Observations indicate that episodic coastal flooding is increasing along many coastlines in 
North America (robust evidence, high agreement), and this episodic coastal flooding will increase in many 
North American regions under future climate change (high confidence) although land uplift from glacial 
isostatic adjustment in northern and Hudson Bay portions of Northeast North America leads to only medium 
confidence of coastal flood increases in that region. Sweet et al. (2018) found 2000-2015 observed increases 
of about 125% in high tide flooding frequencies along the southern Atlantic US coastline, with 75% 
increases along the US Gulf Coast and US northern Atlantic coastlines. That same study noted that a GMSL 
of 0.5m in 2100 would increase high tide (‘nuisance’) flooding from current rates of about once a month for 
most coastal regions to about once every other day along the US Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and smaller 
frequency increases along the Pacific coast, and Dahl et al. (2017) found similar trends on the US East Coast 
prior to mid-century (see also . The present day 1:50 yr ETWL is projected to occur around 3 times a year by 
2100 with a SLR of 1 m all around the region, except in most of Eastern North America where it is expected 
to have return periods of 1:1 yr – 1:2 yrs (Vitousek et al., 2017). Ghanbari et al. (2019) projected 
corresponding shifts toward higher frequencies of major flooding events for 20 US cities. Figure 12.4r and 
Figure SM.12.6 show increases of 70 cm or more in the 100-yr return period extreme total water level 
(ETWL) over much of the US East Coast, British Columbia, Alaska, and the Hudson Bay under RCP8.5 by 
2100 (relative to 1980–2014), with lower increases in Northern Mexico, Northern Canada, Labrador, and the 
Pacific and Gulf Coasts of the US (Vousdoukas et al., 2018). Projected coastal flooding increases generally 
follow patterns of RSL change although sea ice loss in the north also increases open water storm surge 
(Greenan et al., 2019).  
 
*Coastal erosion:* There is limited evidence of changes in North American episodic storm erosion caused by 
waves and storm surges. Observations show increased extreme wave energy on the Pacific coast, but no clear 
trend on other US coasts given substantial natural variability (Bromirski et al., 2013; Vose et al., 2014). In 
terms of long term coastal erosion, shoreline retreat rates of around 1 m yr<sup>-1</sup> have been observed during 
1984-2015 along the sandy coasts of NWN and NCA while portions of the US Gulf Coast have seen a retreat 
rate approaching 2.5 m yr<sup>-1</sup> (Luijendijk et al., 2018; Mentaschi et al., 2018).Sandy shorelines along ENA and 
WNA have remained more or less stable during 1984 – 2014, but a shoreline progradation rate of around 0.5 
m yr<sup>-1</sup> has been observed in NEN  Mentaschi et al. (2018) report 1984-2015 coastal area land losses of 630 
km2 and 1,260 km2 along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of USA, respectively. 
 
Projections indicate that sandy coasts in most of the region will experience shoreline retreat through the 21st 
century (high confidence). Median shoreline change projections presented by Vousdoukas et al. (2020) 
compated CMIP5 projections show that sandy shorelines in NWN, ENA, and NCA will retreat by between 
40 m – 80 m by mid-century (relative to 2010) under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Projections for NEN and 
WNA are lower at 20 m – 30 m under the same RCPs. The highest median mid-century projection in the 
region is for CNA at around 125 m under both RCPs. RCP4.5 projections for 2100 show shoreline retreats of 
100 m or more along the sandy coasts of NWN, CNA, and NCA, while retreats of between 40 m – 80 m are 
projected in other regions. Under RCP8.5, retreats exceeding 100 m are projected in all regions except NEN 
and WNA (approximately 80 m) by 2100, with particularly high retreats in NWN (160 m), CNA (330 m) and 
SCA (200 m). The total length of sandy coasts in North America that are projected to retreat by more than a 
median of 100 m by 2100 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 is about 15,000 km and 25,000 km respectively, an 
increase of approximately 70%. 
 
*Marine heatwave:*  There is high confidence in observed increases in marine heatwave frequency and future 
increases in marine heatwaves are very likely around North America (Box 9.2). The total number of MHW 
days per decade increased in the North American coastal zone, albeit somewhat more in the Pacific (Oliver 
et al., 2018; Smale et al., 2019). Projected increases in degree heating weeks (Heron et al., 2016) and degree 
heating months (Frieler et al., 2013) indicate increasing bleaching-level and mortality-level heating stress 
threshold events for reefs in Florida and Mexico.  
 
Mean SST is projected to increase by 1 ºC (3 ºC) around North America by 2100, with a hotspot of around 4 
ºC (5 ºC) off the North America Atlantic coastline under RCP4.5 (RCP8.5) conditions (see Interactive Atlas). 
Frölicher et al. (2018) projected increasing MHW frequency and spatial extent at a 2℃ global warming level 
with the largest increases in the Gulf of Mexico and off the southern US East Coast (>20x) as well as off the 
coast of the Pacific Northwest (>15x). Projections for SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 both show an increase in 
MHWs around North America by 2081 – 2100, relative to 1985 – 2014 (Box 9.2, Figure 1). 
 
*There is high confidence that most coastal CIDs in North America will continue to increase in the 
future with climate change. An observed increase in relative sea level rise is virtually certain to 
continue in North America (other than around the Hudson Bay and Southern Alaska) contributing to 
more frequent and severe coastal flooding in low-lying areas (high confidence) and shoreline retreat 
along most sandy coasts (high confidence). Marine heatwaves are also expected to increase all around 
the region over the 21st century (high confidence).* 
 
The assessed direction of change in climatic impact-drivers for North America and associated confidence 
levels are illustrated in Table 12.8. 
 
<tableref>12.8</tableref>

## 12.4.7  Small islands 
 
This section covers the climatic impact-drivers affecting small islands around the world (see definition of 
SIDS in the Glossary; Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.2) with a particular focus on small islands in the Caribbean 
(CAR) Sea and the Pacific Ocean. Caribbean and Pacific small islands have mostly tropical climates and 
local conditions are also influenced by diverse topography ranging from low-lying islands and atolls to 
volcanic and mountainous terrain. Climate variability in these islands is influenced by the trade winds, the 
easterly waves, tropical cyclones (TC), and the migrations of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), 
the North Atlantic Subtropical High, and the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ), and other modes of 
climate variability as discussed in Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.2. Furthermore, changes in the ocean 
temperature and chemistry, and relative sea level have strong impacts on these small islands given their 
geographical location and dependence on coastal and marine ecosystem services. 
 
IPCC AR5 recognized the heterogeneity in these small islands in terms of physical geography, socio-
economic and cultural backgrounds, as well as their vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. Similar to 
previous reports, these regions have been assessed together in this section given similarities in the challenges 
they face in addressing climate change impacts and risk, which was thought to be dominated by sea level rise 
until IPCC AR4 (Nurse et al., 2014; Betzold, 2015). Since then there has been a substantial increase in the 
number and complexity of the literature on the drivers and impacts of climate change on small islands (BOM 
and CSIRO, 2011, 2014; Nurse et al., 2014; Gould et al., 2018; Keener et al., 2018). There are also 
increasing efforts in producing higher resolution climate projections for the small islands through 
downscaling methods (Elison Timm et al., 2015; McLean et al., 2015; Khalyani et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 
2016a; Stennett-Brown et al., 2017; Bhardwaj et al., 2018; Bowden et al., 2021).  
 
IPCC AR5 identified the key climate and ocean-related hazards affecting the small islands, which occur at 
different timescales and have diverse impacts on multiple sectors (Christensen et al., 2013; Nurse et al., 
2014). Recent findings from IPCC SR1.5 and IPCC SROCC emphasize that the multiple interrelated climate 
hazards currently faced by low-lying islands and coastal areas will be amplified in the future, especially at 
higher global warming levels (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; IPCC, 2019b).  
 
 
### 12.4.7.1  Heat and Cold  
 
*Mean air temperature:*  Significant warming trends are clearly evident in the small islands, such as those in 
the Pacific, CAR, and Western Indian Ocean, particularly over the latter half of the 20th century (see Figure 
Atlas.11; Section Atlas.10.2; Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.2, Table 1). This observed warming signal in the 
tropical western Pacific has been attributed to anthropogenic forcing (Wang et al., 2016). There is high 
confidence of warming over small islands even at 1.5°C global warming level (GWL) (Section Atlas.10.4; 
Figure Atlas.31) (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). Mean temperature is very likely to increase by 1°C–2°C 
(2°C–4°C) by 2041–2060 (2081–2100) under RCP8.5 (BOM and CSIRO, 2014) and SSP3-7.0 (Figure 4.19 
and Figure Atlas.13) (Section Atlas.10.4) (Almazroui et al., 2021). 
 
*Extreme heat:*  Observation records indicate warming trends in the temperature extremes since the 1950s in 
CAR and the Pacific small islands (high confidence) (Section 11.3.2; Section 11.9, Table 11.7). A detectable 
anthropogenic increase in summertime heat stress index has been identified over a number of island regions 
in CAR, western tropical Pacific, and tropical Indian Ocean, based on wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) 
index trends for 1973–2012 (medium confidence) (Knutson and Ploshay, 2016). An increasing trend in the 
maximum daytime heat index is also noted in CAR during the 1980–2014 period, as well as more extreme 
heat events since 1991 (Ramirez-Beltran et al., 2017).  
 
Compared with the recent past, it is likely that the intensity and frequency of hot (cold) temperature extremes 
will increase (decrease) in the small islands (Section 11.9, Table 11.7) (BOM and CSIRO, 2014). Warm 
spell conditions will occur up to half the year in CAR at 1.5°C GWL with an additional 70 days at 2°C 
(Taylor et al., 2018), with livestock temperature-humidity tolerance thresholds increasingly surpassed (Lallo 
et al., 2018). In CAR, a median increase of almost a month where temperatures exceed 35°C is projected by 
end of the 21st century under SSP5-8.5 (Figure 12.4a.c and Figure SM 12.1). Heat waves are projected to 
increase in CAR by the mid- and end of the 21st century under RCP8.5 (Section 11.3.5; Section 11.9, Table 
11.7). Figure 12.4d-f and Figure SM 12.2 also show an increase of about 30-60 days with HI exceeding 41°C 
by 2041-2060 under SSP5-8.5 relative to 1995-2014 in CAR, with an additional increase of about days by 
end of the 21st century for RCP8.5/SSP5-8.5, but this increase remains below 50 days for RCP2.6/SSP1-2.6. 
The Pacific Islands is also among regions projected to have an increase in number of days with mean HI 
exceeding 41°C by 2091-2100 under RCP8.5/SSP5-8.5, increasing the risk of heat stress in the region 
(Newth and Gunasekera, 2018). 
 
*It is very likely that the significant recent warming trends observed in the small islands will continue in 
the 21st century, which will likely further increase heat stress in these regions.* 
 
 
### 12.4.7.2  Wet and Dry 
 
*Mean precipitation:*  Observational datasets have generally revealed no significant long-term trends in 
rainfall in the Caribbean over the 20th century when analysed at seasonal and inter-decadal timescales, 
except for some areas where there is evidence for decreasing trends for the period 1901-2010 but not for the 
period 1951-2010 (Knutson and Zeng, 2018; Section Atlas.10.2; Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.2, Table 1). 
Although there are spatial variations, annual rainfall trends in the Western Indian Ocean are mostly 
decreasing, with generally non-significant trends in the Western tropical Pacific since the 1950s (low 
confidence). Significant drying trends are noted in the southern Pacific subtropics and southwestern French 
Polynesia during the 1951-2015 period  (McGree et al., 2019), and in some areas of Hawaii during the 1920-
2012 period (medium confidence) (Section Atlas.10.2; Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.2, Table 1). 
 
Atlas.10.4 projects precipitation reduction over the Caribbean (high confidence) and parts of the 
Atlantic and Indian Oceans, particularly in June to August by end of 21st century. Precipitation is 
generally projected to increase in the small islands in parts of the western and equatorial Pacific, but there is 
low confidence in broad changes givend drier conditionsprojected for the southern sub-tropical and eastern 
Pacific Ocean (limited agreement given spatial and seasonal variability; Section Atlas.10.4; Figure Atlas.31) 
(Almazroui et al., 2021). 
 
*River flood:*  There is limited evidence on observed changes in river flooding in small islands. Long-term 
records in Hawaii indicate no clear trends in peak flow, except for the significant decrease in peak 
streamflow in Hawaii Island over the period 1967-2016 (Bassiouni and Oki, 2013; Clilverd et al., 2019). 
Similarly, there is no significant trend in the frequency and height (after adjusting for average sea level rise) 
of river flood in Fiji over the period 1892-2013 (McAneney et al., 2017). There is low confidence on the 
direction of future change of river flooding in the small islands due to the limited currently available 
literature. In Oahu, Hawaii, extreme peak flow events with high return periods are projected to increase by 
end of 21st century under RCP8.5, but there is also high uncertainty in these projections (Leta et al., 2018).  
 
*Heavy precipitation and pluvial flood:* Heavy precipitation days in CAR have increased in magnitude, and 
have been more frequent in the northern part during the latter part of the 20th century (low confidence) 
(Section 11.4.2; Table 11.7). The direction of change in extreme precipitation varies across the Pacific and 
depends on the season (low confidence) (Section 11.4.2; Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.2, Table 1). Although 
pluvial flooding events have been observed in some islands, there is limited evidence for an assessment on 
past changes in pluvial flooding unlike in other regions. There is low confidence in the projected increase in 
magnitude of very heavy precipitation days in CAR across different GWLs (Table 11.7). On the other hand, 
there is high confidence in the increase in frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events (i.e. 1-in-20 year 
rainfall events) in the western tropical Pacific in the 21st century even for RCP2.6 scenario based on model 
agreement and mechanistic understanding but low confidence in the magnitude of change in extreme rainfall 
due to model bias (BOM and CSIRO, 2014).  
 
*Landslide:*  Heavy rainfall, such as from tropical cyclones, can trigger landslides over steep terrain in the 
small islands (Bessette-Kirton et al., 2019). There is limited evidence to determine long-term trends in 
rainfall-induced landslides in the small islands (Kirschbaum et al., 2015; Sepúlveda and Petley, 2015; Froude 
and Petley, 2018; Bessette-Kirton et al., 2019). There is low confidence in the future change in landslides in 
the small islands. The direction of change may depend on future changes in precipitation, tropical cyclones, 
climate modes (e.g., El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)), as well as human disturbance, but more data 
and understanding of the complexity of these relationships are needed, especially in these vulnerable areas 
(Sepúlveda and Petley, 2015; Gariano and Guzzetti, 2016; Froude and Petley, 2018). 
 
*Aridity:*  Current estimates identify many small islands as being under water stress and thus particularly 
sensitive to variations in rainfall and groundwater, population growth and demand, land use change, among 
others (Holding et al., 2016) (Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.2). From 1950 to 2016, a heterogeneous but prevalent 
drying trend is found in CAR (medium confidence), where drought variability is modulated by the tropical 
Pacific and North Atlantic oceans (Herrera and Ault, 2017) (Table 11.7, Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.2, Table 
1). In the future, increased aridity and decreased freshwater availability are projected in many small islands 
due to higher evapotranspiration in a warmer climate that partially offsets increases or exacerbates reductions 
in precipitation (Karnauskas et al., 2016, 2018b; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). Increased aridity is projected 
for the majority of the small islands, such as in CAR, southern Pacific and Western Indian Ocean, by 2041-
2059 relative to 1981-1999, and at 1.5°C and 2.0°C GWLs, under RCP8.5, which will further intensify by 
2081-2099 (Karnauskas et al., 2016, 2018b) (medium confidence). Groundwater recharge is projected to 
increase in Maui, Hawaii except on the leeward sides of the island, which underscores the importance of 
topography and elevation on freshwater availability in different island microclimates (Brewington et al., 
2019; Mair et al., 2019). 
 
*Hydrological drought:* There is low confidence of widespread changes to hydrological drought in the 
Caribbean or Pacific small islands in recent decades, although an increasing number of studies document 
local changes. Records in Hawaii indicate downward trends in low streamflow and base flow from 1913 to 
2008 (Bassiouni and Oki, 2013). Decadal variability of Hawaiian streamflow coincides with rainfall 
fluctuations associated with the Pacific Decadal Variability although significant average declines in surface 
and baseflow runoff of about 8% and 11% per decade, respectively, have been noted during the 1987-2016 
period (Clilverd et al., 2019).  
 
There is low confidence in hydrological drought change projections given low signal to noise ratios and the 
challenge in representing island scales in global analyses.  Prudhomme et al. (2014) recognized the 
Caribbean as one of the regions with highest increase in regional deficit index (RDI; a measure of the 
fraction of area in hydrological drought conditions) by end of the 21st century under RCP8.5. Daily 
streamflow and extreme low flows in two watersheds in Oahu, Hawaii are projected to decline by mid- and 
end of the 21st century under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, which would result in more frequent hydrological 
droughts in this area (Leta et al., 2018).  
 
*Agricultural and ecological drought:* Recent trends toward more frequent and severe droughts have been 
noted in the small islands but only generate low confidence in broad trend patterns given high spatial 
variability including heightened drought on the leeward side of islands (e.g., Frazier and Giambelluca, 2017; 
Herrera and Ault, 2017; McGree et al., 2019; Table 11.7, Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.2, Table 1). There is 
medium confidence that agricultural and ecological droughts will increase in frequency, duration, magnitude, 
and extent in the small islands, such as in CAR and parts of the Pacific, particularly where there are future 
declines in precipitation compounded by higher evapotranspiration, under increasing levels of warming 
(Naumann et al., 2018; Taylor et al., 2018; Vichot‐Llano et al., 2021). Relative to the period 1985-2014, 
decreases in annual surface and total column soil moisture becomes more robust in more areas in CAR by 
2071-2100 under SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios (Cook et al., 2020a), but global simulations are 
challenged to represent drought features in small island domains (see also Section 11.9).  
 
*Fire weather:*  There is limited evidence on trends in wildfire in CAR and the Pacific. Records of wildfire in 
Hawaii from 2005-2011 indicate a peak in area burned during the hot and dry summer months, but  
Trauernicht et al. (2015) note the difficulty in establishing the link between past climate and wildfire trends 
due to human activities and vegetation changes. Availability of literature limits assessment on future fire 
weather in the small islands (low confidence). Drying and warming trends tend to increase fire probability 
aside from the climate impact on fuel loading, e.g., grassland fires in Hawaii (Trauernicht, 2019), and 
wildfires in Puerto Rico (Van Beusekom et al., 2018).  
 
*Observed and projected rainfall trends vary spatially across the small islands. Higher 
evapotranspiration under a warming climate can partially offset future increases or amplify future 
reductions in rainfall resulting in drier conditions and increase water stress in the small islands 
(medium confidence).*  

### 12.4.7.3  Wind 
 
*Mean wind speed:*  Scarcity of observations limits assessment of long-term changes in winds over the small 
islands in the Pacific and CAR. Records indicate that average daily wind speeds have slowly declined in 
Hawaii, but trends have remained constant across western and south Pacific sites since the mid-20th century 
(Marra and Kruk, 2017). Recent studies of reanalyses and hindcast simulations indicate an intensification of 
the Pacific trade winds during the 1992-2011 period, which contributed to the ocean cooling in the tropical 
central and eastern Pacific (England et al., 2014; Takahashi and Watanabe, 2016). Projections estimate up to 
0.4 m s-1 (8%) increase in annual winds in CAR under RCP8.5, which is associated with changes in the 
extension of the North Atlantic Subtropical High that enhances the Caribbean low-level jet during the wet 
season, and stronger local easterlies due to enhanced land-ocean temperature differences in the dry season 
(Costoya et al., 2019) (low confidence).  
  
*Tropical cyclone:*  Tropical cyclones have devastating impacts on the small islands due to intense winds, 
storm surge, and rainfall, although the associated rainfall can also be beneficial for freshwater resources. It is 
likely that tropical cyclone intensity and intensification rates at a global scale have increased in the past 40 
years but it is not clear if regional-scale changes are basin-wide or due to shifts in tracks (Section 11.7.1.2). 
Other features are less sensitive to these issues, such as the poleward migration where tropical cyclones 
reach peak intensity in the western North Pacific and the slowdown in tropical cyclone translational speed in 
most basins in the latter half of the 20th century (low confidence), which can enhance rainfall and flooding 
events, including over small islands in CAR and the Pacific (Section 11.7.1.2).  
 
Future global changes in tropical cyclones include more frequent Category 4-5 storms (high confidence) and 
increased rain rates (very high confidence) (Knutson et al., 2020), with relative sea level rise exacerbating 
storm surge potential but large differences per region depending also on changes to future storm tracks (see 
Section 11.7.1.5). By the late 21st century, tropical cyclones are projected to be less frequent in the basins of 
the western and eastern North Pacific, Bay of Bengal, Caribbean Sea and in the Southern Hemisphere, but 
will be more frequent in the subtropical central Pacific (Murakami et al., 2014; Yoshida et al., 2017; Bell et 
al., 2019; Knutson et al., 2020). Over CAR, tropical cyclone intensity is expected to increase due to higher 
sea surface temperatures but can be inhibited by increases in vertical wind shear in the region (medium 
confidence) (Kossin, 2017; Ting et al., 2019). The poleward movement of the area where tropical cyclones 
reach peak intensity in the western North Pacific is likely to continue, which affects the tropical cyclone 
frequency over the small islands in the area (Kossin et al., 2016) (Section 11.7.1.5). Projections also indicate 
an increase (decrease) in the tropical cyclone frequency during El Niño (La Niña) events in the Pacific at the 
end of the 21st century (Chand et al., 2017). RCP8.5 2080-2099 projections indicate an increase in tropical 
cyclone number by 2% in the North Central Pacific relative to 1980-1999, with tracks shifting northward 
towards Hawaii (Li et al., 2018d). Given projected reductions to the overall number of storms but increases 
in storm intensity, total rainfall and storm surge potential, we assess medium confidence of overall changes to 
tropical cyclones affecting the Caribbean and Pacific small islands. 
 
*Global changes indicate that small islands will generally face fewer but more intense tropical cyclones 
(medium confidence) although there is substantial variability across small island regions given 
projected regional shifts in storm tracks.*   
 
### 12.4.7.4  Coastal and Oceanic 
 
*Relative sea level:*  Relative sea level rise (SLR) continues to be a major threat to small islands and atolls, 
since it can exacerbate the impacts of other climate hazards on low-lying coastal communities and 
infrastructures, ecosystems, and freshwater resources (Nurse et al., 2014; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). In 
the Indian Ocean- South Pacific region, a new tide-gauge based reconstruction finds a regional-mean RSL 
change of 1.33 [0.80 to 1.86] mm yr<sup>-1</sup> over 1900-2018 (Frederikse et al., 2020) compared to a GMSL change 
of around 1.7 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> (Section 2.3.3.3; Table 9.5). RSLR rates based on satellite altimetry for the period 
1993-2018 increased to 3.65 [3.23 to 4.08] mm yr<sup>-1</sup> (Frederikse et al., 2020), compared to a GMSL change of 
3.25 mm yr<sup>-1</sup> (Section 2.3.3.3; Table 9.5).  

Relative sea-level rise is very likely to continue in the oceans in the Small Island States. Around the small 
islands, regional-mean RSLR projections vary widely, from 0.4 m–0.6 m under SSP1-RCP2.6 to 0.7 m–1.6 
m under SSP5-RCP8.5 for 2081–2100 relative to 1995–2014 (median values), but in general they are 
situated in areas with RSL changes ranging from the mean projected GMSL change to above-average values 
{Section 9.6.3.3}. These RSLR projections may however be underestimated due to potential partial 
representation of land subsidence in their assessment (Section 9.6.3.2). 
 
*Coastal flood:* Relative sea-level rise, storm surges, and swells contribute to coastal inundation in the small 
islands, where studies on historical trends in coastal flooding are currently limited. For example, a swell 
event due to distant extra-tropical cyclones in December 2008 raised extreme water levels leading to 
flooding affecting five Pacific island nations: Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Papua New Guinea, Kiribati and 
Solomon Islands (Hoeke et al., 2013; Merrifield et al., 2014). Over low-lying atoll islands in the northwest 
tropical Pacific, potential increases in the areal extent in coastal flooding with reduced return periods, 
especially at higher SLR scenarios, are expected to have negative consequences on freshwater resources and 
island habitability (Storlazzi et al., 2015, 2018). Select tide gauges across the Pacific also indicate increasing 
trends in the frequency of minor flooding since the 1960s (Marra and Kruk, 2017). 
 
As relative sea levels increase, the potential for coastal flooding increases in the small islands (high 
confidence). Across the Pacific and CAR small islands, the 5th – 95th percentile range of the 1:100 yr ETWL 
is projected to increase (relative to 1980 – 2014) by 10 cm – 35 cm and by 14 cm – 41 cm by 2050 under 
RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively (Figure 12.4q). By 2100, this range is projected to be 27 cm – 81 cm and 
44 cm – 188 cm under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively (Figure 12.4p,r) (Vousdoukas et al., 2018; Kirezci 
et al., 2020). Furthermore, by 2050, the present day 1:100 yr ETWL is projected to have median return 
periods of between 1:1 yr and 1:50 yr in both the Pacific and CAR small islands, with some Pacific islands 
projected to experience the present day 1:100 yr ETWL more than once a year (Vousdoukas et al., 2018; 
Oppenheimer et al., 2019). By 2100, the present day 1:50 yr ETWL is projected to occur around 3 times a 
year by 2100 with a SLR of 1 m at Pacific and CAR small islands (Vitousek et al., 2017). In the Western 
Tropical Pacific, the magnitude and frequency of coastal flooding due to SLR can be modulated by changes 
in the wave climate (Shope et al., 2016).  
 
*Coastal erosion:*  Recent studies have indicated variable and dynamic changes in shorelines of reef islands 
(medium confidence), including both erosion and accretion, which suggest factors other than SLR affecting 
shoreline changes, such as in the central and western Pacific within the past 50 to 60 year timeframe (Webb 
and Kench, 2010; Le Cozannet et al., 2014; Ford and Kench, 2015; Duvat and Pillet, 2017). For example, 
islands on atolls in the central and western Pacific have not substantially eroded or reduced in size in the past 
decades when sea level has increased but rather have changed their position and morphology due to 
anthropogenic factors (e.g., seawalls, reclamation) and climate-ocean processes (Biribo and Woodroffe, 
2013; McLean and Kench, 2015). Analysis of aerial and satellite imagery revealed severe shoreline retreat in 
six islands and the disappearance of five vegetated reef islands in Solomon Islands in the western Pacific 
between 1947 to 2014, which may be due to the interaction between SLR and waves (Albert et al., 2016). In 
French Polynesia, changes in shoreline and island area have been observed since the 1960s, partly due to the 
effect of TCs on sediment changes and human activities (Duvat and Pillet, 2017; Duvat et al., 2017). Coastal 
erosion have also been noted over the small, low-lying, sandy islands, such as in French Polynesia and 
Solomon Islands, among others, due to high relative sea level rise and storms (Luijendijk et al., 2018a; 
Mentaschi et al., 2018). Average shoreline retreat rates between 1 m yr<sup>-1</sup> and 2 m yr<sup>-1</sup> are estimated for the 
islands in the Equatorial Pacific and in CAR, while a retreat rate of 0.5 m is estimated for islands in the south 
Pacific, based on satellite observations from 1984-2016 (Luijendijk et al., 2018a; Mentaschi et al., 2018). 
There was also a loss of 610 km2 vs. a gain of 520 km2 in coastal area in Oceania during the 1984-2015 
period (Mentaschi et al., 2018). 
 
Projections indicate that shoreline retreat will occur over most of the small islands in the Pacific and CAR 
throughout the 21st century with spatial variability (high confidence). Median shoreline change projections 
(CMIP5), relative to 2010, presented by Vousdoukas et al. (2020) show that, by mid-century, shorelines in 
the islands in the equatorial Pacific and south Pacific will retreat by around 40 m, under both RCP4.5 and 
RCP8.5. In CAR islands, sandy shorelines are projected to retreat by about 80 m by mid-century under both 
RCPs. By 2100, more than 100 m of median shoreline retreat is projected for all small islands under both 
RCPs; notably in CAR where retreats approaching 200 m (relative to 2010) are projected under both RCPs. 
The total length of sandy coasts in CAR and Pacific small islands that is projected to retreat by more than a 
median of 100 m by 2100 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 is about 1,100 km and 1,200 km respectively, an 
increase of approximately 14%.   
 
*Marine heatwave:*  Ocean temperatures from satellite observations noted a moderate increase of 1–4 annual 
marine heat wave (MHW) events between 1982–1988 and 2000–2016 over some areas in the Indian Ocean, 
subtropical parts of the North and South Atlantic, and central and western parts of the North and South 
Pacific, but a decrease in frequency (2 annual events) over the eastern Pacific Ocean (Oliver et al., 2018) 
(see Box 9.2). The intensity of MHWs has also increased between 0.2°C and 0.5°C over the equatorial 
portions of the North Atlantic, and the South Pacific. Over the eastern tropical Pacific, the decrease in 
intensity and duration of MHW is between 0.5–1.0 °C and between 30–75 days, respectively (Oliver et al., 
2018) (see Box 9.2). There is high confidence that MHWs will increase around all small island nations. 
Marine heatwaves are projected to be more intense and prolonged where the largest changes are noted in the 
equatorial region with maximum annual intensities up to 1.2°C (1.8°C) and annual mean duration reaching 
100 days (200 days) at 1.5°C (2.0 °C) warming levels (Frölicher et al., 2018). Projections for SSP1-2.6 and 
SSP5-8.5 both show an increase in MHWs around all small island nations by 2081–2100, relative to 1985–
2014 (Box 9.2, Figure 1).  
 
*In summary, relative sea level rise is very likely in the oceans around small islands, and along with 
storm surges and waves will exacerbate coastal inundation in small islands. Shoreline retreat is 
projected along sandy coasts of most small islands (high confidence). There is high confidence that 
MHWs will increase around all small island nations.* 
 
The assessed direction of change in climatic impact-drivers for CAR and Pacific small islands and associated 
confidence levels are illustrated in Table 12.9. Cold, Snow, Ice related climatic impact-drivers, and sand and 
dust storms are not broadly relevant in small islands.

## 12.4.8  Open and deep ocean 

Oceans face challenges from anthropogenic perturbations to the global Earth system, which cause increasing 
ocean warming, carbon dioxide induced acidification and oxygen loss (Bindoff et al., 2019). Climate change 
will affect the major oceanic CIDs described in Section 12.2; mean ocean temperature, marine heatwaves, 
ocean acidity, ocean salinity, dissolved oxygen (O2), severe wind storms and sea ice melting. These changes 
result in a shifting profile of hazards relevant to impact and risk assessments (Section 12.3). New evidence, 
the IPCC (2019b) and advances in the new CMIP6 climate simulations reinforce confidence in projected 
changes in climatic impact-drivers in the global oceans. As the ocean has taken up about 90% of the global 
warming for the period 1971-2018 (Section 7.2.2.2), the emergence of the sea surface temperature increase 
signal has already been observed in global oceans over the last century (Hawkins et al., 2020). The 
emergence signal in in sea ice extent decrease has already emerged in the Arctic Ocean (Landrum and 
Holland, 2020), while ocean acidification and low oxygen have also already emerged in many ocenic regions 
and will emerge in all global oceans by 2050 under RCP8.5 (see Section 12.5.2; Table 12.10). This section 
assesses key hazards that can be linked with sectoral and regional vulnerability and exposure in open and 
deep oceans, drawing from previous Chapters (2,3,4, 5, and 9). 
 
*Mean ocean temperature:* It is very likely that global mean sea surface temperature global mean SST has 
increased by 0.88°C [0.68 to 1.01°C] from 1850-1900 to 2011-2020, and 0.60°C [0.44 to 0.74°C] from 
1980-2020 (Section 2.3.1.1.6; Table 2.4). There is very high confidence that the Indian Ocean, western 
equatorial the Pacific Ocean, and western boundary currents have warmed faster than the global average, 
while the Southern Ocean, the eastern equatorial Pacific, and the North Atlantic Ocean have warmed more 
slowly or slightly cooled (Section 9.2.1.1). It is virtually certain that SST will continue to increase in the 21st 
century at a rate depending on future emission scenario, while the global mean ocean surface temperature 
will continue to increase throughout the 21st century (very high confidence), with CMIP6 projections 
indicating an increase of 0.86°C (likely range: 0.43-1.47°C) under SSP1-2.6 and 2.89°C (2.01-4.07°C) under 
SSP5-8.5, by 2081-2100, relative to 1995-2014 (Section 9.2.1.1). Global warming of 2°C above pre-
industrial levels is projected to increase sea surface temperature, resulting in the exceedance of numerous 
hazard thresholds for pathogens, seagrasses, mangroves, kelp forests, rocky shores, coral reefs and other 
marine ecosystems (Poloczanska et al., 2013b, 2016, 2013a; Pörtner et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014; Graham et 
al., 2015; Schoepf et al., 2015; Gobler et al., 2017; Henson et al., 2017; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2017; 
Krueger et al., 2017; Hughes et al., 2018b, 2018a; Perry et al., 2018) (medium confidence). It is virtually 
certain that upper ocean stratification has increased at a rate of 4.9±1.5% during 1970-2018 and that this will 
continue to increase in the 21st century (Section 9.2.1.3), potentially leading to reduced nutrient supply and 
total productivity (Moore et al., 2018) (low confidence).  
 
*Marine heatwave:* Marine heaywaves have increased in frequency over the 20th century, with an 
approximate doubling since the 1980s (high confidence), and their intensity and duration have also increased 
(medium confidence) (Box 9.2).  Projections show that this increasing trend likely continues with 2-9 times 
more frequent marine heatwaves (at global scale) projected by 2081-2100, relative to 1995-2014 under 
SSP1-2.6, and 4-18 times more frequent under SSP5-8.5. The largest changes in MHW frequency likely to 
occur in the tropical ocean and the Arctic, while there is medium confidence of moderate increases in the 
mid-latitudes, and of small increases in the Southern Ocean (Box 9.2). Permanent MHWs (more than 360 
days per year, relative to the historical climate conditions) are projected to occur in the 21st century in parts 
of the tropical ocean, in the Arctic Ocean and around latitude 45°S, under SSP5-8.5 (Box 9.2).  The 
occurrence of such permanent MHWs can be largely avoided under SSP1-2.6 scenario (Box 9.2). MHW can 
have devastating and long-term impacts on ecosystems (Oliver et al., 2018), making them an emerging 
hazard for marine ecosystems (Frölicher and Laufkötter, 2018; Smale et al., 2019). A series of marine 
heatwaves that occurred in 2010-2011 had consequences for seagrass in Western Australia (Wernberg et al., 
2013; Arias-Ortiz et al., 2018), and for loster fishery in the Gulf of Maine (Pershing et al., 2018). The 
MHWs that occured Western Australia in 2015/2016 lead to the third-highest mass bleaching globally (Le 
Nohaïc et al., 2017).  
 
*Ocean acidity:* With the increasing CO2 concentration, the global mean ocean surface pH is decreasing and 
is now the lowest it has been for at least a thousand years (very high confidence) (Section 2.3.3.5). It is very 
likely that, since the 1980s, ocean surface pH has changed at a rate of –0.016 to –0.019 per decade in the 
subtropical open oceans, at –0.010 to –0.026 per decade in the tropical Pacific, and at –0.003 to –0.026 per 
decade in open subpolar and polar zones (Section 2.3.3.5; Section 5.3.3.2).  Over the period 1870–1899 to 
2080–2099, ocean surface pH is projected to decline by -0.16 ± 0.002 under SSP1–2.6, and by -0.44 ± 0.005 
under SSP5–8.5 (Section 4.3.2.5; Section 5.3.4.1). Declining ocean pH will exacerbate negative impacts on 
marine species (Albright et al., 2016; Kwiatkowski et al., 2016; Watson et al., 2017) (medium confidence). 
 
*Ocean salinity:* Salinity contrasts have increased since the 1950s, near the ocean surface (virtually certain) 
and in the sub-surface (very likely), with high salinity regions becoming more saline and low salinity regions 
becoming fresher (Section 2.3.3.2). At the basin scale, it is very likely that the Pacific and the Southern 
Oceans have freshened, and the Atlantic has become more saline (Section 2.3.3.2). The IPCC (2019) 
assessment that fresh ocean regions get fresher and salty ocean regions get saltier will continue in the 21st 
century is confirmed in Section 9.2.2.2.   
 
At the regional scale, by 2100, the average Arctic surface salinity is projected to decrease by 1.5 ± 1.1 psu, 
and the liquid freshwater column in the Arctic Ocean is projected increase by 5.4 ± 3.8 m under RCP8.5, 
(Shu et al., 2018). In the Indian Ocean, sea surface salinity is projected to decrease by 0.49 psu and 0.75 psu 
by 2080, compared to 2015, under RCP2.6 and RCP2.6, respectively (Akhiljith et al., 2019). Projections for 
the North and South Atlantic Oceans indicate increasing salinity in the upper layer (0 – 500 m) under both 
RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, due to the decreasing freshwater input from the Equator and increasing net evaporation 
(Skliris et al., 2020). There is medium confidence that fresh ocean regions (Pacific, Southern and Indian 
oceans) will get fresher and salty ocean regions (Atlantic ocean) will get saltier over the 21st century (IPCC, 
2019;  Section 9.2.2.2). Ocean warming and high-latitude surface freshening is projected to continue to 
increase upper ocean stratification in the 21st century (Section 9.2.1.3).  
 
*Dissolved oxygen:* Since the middle of the last century, oxygen concentrations of open and coastal waters 
have been declining, and such deoxygenation affects biological and biogeochemical processes in the ocean 
(Schmidtko et al., 2017). In recent decades, low oxygen zones in ocean ecosystems have expanded, and 
projections indicate an acceleration with global warming (Diaz and Rosenberg, 2008; Gilly et al., 2013; 
Gobler et al., 2014) (medium confidence). A 2% loss (4.8 ± 2.1 Pmoles O2) in total dissolved oxygen in the 
upper ocean layer (100–600 m) has been observed during 1970–2010 (Section 2.3.4.2), with the highest 
oxygen loss of up to 30 mol m-2 per decade in the equatorial and North Pacific, the Southern Ocean and the 
South Atlantic Ocean (Section 5.3.3.2). Global mean ocean oxygen concentration is projected to decrease by 
6.36 ± 2.92 mmol m-3 under SSP1-2.6 and by 13.27 ± 5.28 mmol m-3 under SSP5-8.5 in the subsurface (100-
600 m) by 2080–2099, compared to 1870–1899, which is respectively 71% and 40% greater than previous 
estimates based on CMIP5 models (Section 5.3.3.2). In the benthic ocean, projected future losses of 
dissolved oxygen concentration by 2080–2099, compared to 1870– 1899, are −5.14 ± 2.04 mmol m−3 under 
SSP1-2.6 and −6.04 ± 2.19 mmol m−3 under SSP5-8.5 (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). Section 5.3.3.2 assessed 
very likely global decreases in ocean oxygen concentrations although there is medium confidence in specific 
regional declines that are expected to expand both anoxic and hypoxic zones, with such reductions of oxygen 
expected to persist for thousands of years (Yamamoto et al., 2015; Frölicher et al., 2020).  
 
*Sea ice:* The Arctic sea ice area for September has decreased from 6.23 to 3.76 million km2 and for March 
from 14.52 to 13.42 million km2 between 1979-1988 and 2010-19 (Section 2.3.2.1.1). There is high 
confidence that sea ice in the Arctic will further decrease in the future under all emission scenarios (Section 
9.3.1.1).  In contrast, there is no clear observed trend in the Antarctic sea ice area over the past few decades 
and there is low confidence of future changes therein (Section 9.3.1.1). The duration of the summer season in 
the Arctic has increased by 5 to 20 weeks between 1979 and 2013, with a significant trend ranging from 5 to 
17 days/decade for earlier spring retreat and from 5 to 25 days/decade for later fall advance, with 
consequences for Arctic marine mammals (AMMs) due to sea ice habitat loss (Laidre et al., 2015). The 
Arctic is projected to be ice-free more often during summer under 2°C global warming compared to 1.5°C 
global warming (Section 9.3.1.1; see also Section 12.4.9 and Section 4.4.2.1), opening new shipping lanes 
for international commerce (Valsson and Ulfarsson, 2011) and lengthening the season for offshore resource 
extraction (Schaeffer et al., 2012). Iceberg numbers are expected to increase as a result of global warming, 
forming an elevated hazard to shipping and offshore facilities (Bigg et al., 2018).  
 
*It is virtually certain that global mean SST will continue to increase throughout the 21st century, 
resulting in the exceedance of numerous hazard thresholds relevant to marine ecosystems (medium 
confidence). Marine heatwaves day are projected to increase in global oceans with a larger increase in 
the tropical ocean and Arctic Ocean (high confidence). It is virtually certain that upper ocean 
stratification will continue to increase in the 21st century. Future Ocean warming will very likely assist 
the development of both anoxic and hypoxic zones, with such reductions of oxygen expected to persist 
for thousands of years. Future projections also indicate freshening of the Pacific, Southern and Indian 
Oceans and a saltier Atlantic Ocean (medium confidence).* 
 
The assessed direction of change in climatic impact-drivers for open and deep ocean regions and associated 
confidence levels are illustrated in Table 12.10, following the AR6 WGI ocean reference regions as proposed 
by the Atlas (Figure Atlas.2b).

## 12.4.9  Polar terrestrial regions 
 
Several recent climate assessments on polar regions describe robust patterns of recent and future climatic 
changes driving impacts and risk for polar environmental, societal, and economic assets, including the IPCC 
SROCC (Meredith et al., 2019), the Report on Snow, Water, Ice and Permafrost in the Arctic (AMAP, 
2017b), and national assessments for the United States (Markon et al., 2018) and Canada (Derksen et al., 
2018). This section examines Greenland and Iceland, the Russian Arctic, Antarctica, and the arctic portions 
of Northern Europe and North America (Figure 1.18c). 
 
 
### 12.4.9.1  Heat and cold 
 
*Mean air temperature:*  Atlas.11.2 shows high confidence in warming of the Arctic in observations and 
projections, measuring among the fastest-warming places at more than twice the global mean, with 
substantially higher temperature increases in the cold season (see also AMAP, 2017; Meredith et al., 2019). 
Atlas.11.1 assessed very likely warming in observations of West Antarctica from 1957-2016, but limited 
evidence of mean air temperature change across East Antarctica even as there is high confidence in future 
warming across the continent (Meredith et al., 2019) (Figures Atlas.32, Atlas.33).  
 
*Extreme heat, cold spell and frost:*  Ecosystem and societal temperature thresholds in polar regions often 
reflect lower tolerance to heat and higher tolerance to cold.  Extreme heat events have increased around the 
Arctic and Iceland since 1979, including increases in cold season warm days and nights, melt days, and 
Arctic winter warm events (T>-10℃) as well as decreases in cold days and nights (Mernild et al., 2014; 
Matthes et al., 2015; Vikhamar-Schuler et al., 2016; Graham et al., 2017; Sui et al., 2017; Dobricic et al., 
2020; Peña-Angulo et al., 2020). Heatwaves causing high temperature records have been recently 
documented in West and East Antarctica (Wille et al., 2019; Robinson et al., 2020). There is high confidence 
that polar amplification will drive increases in Arctic heat extremes as well as continuing declines in the 
magnitude and frequency of cold extremes (Matthes et al., 2015; Kharin et al., 2018), although dynamical 
effects will still bring substantial cold air anomalies over the Arctic (Wu and Francis, 2019).  There is 
medium confidence for equivalent changes in extreme heat in Antarctica based primarily on higher mean 
temperatures, with Lee et al. (2017) projecting more than 50 additional degree days above freezing (2098 
RCP8.5 vs. 2014) over parts of the Antarctic Peninsula but smaller changes over mainland Antarctica.  
 
 
### 12.4.9.2  Wet and dry 
 
*Mean precipitation:*  Atlas.11.2 indicated medium confidence in observed increases in Arctic precipitation 
with the largest rises in the cold season.  Antarctic precipitation showed no significant overall trend since the 
1970s, with a positive trend over the 20th century (Atlas.11.1, 9.4.2.1).  Increases in Arctic and Antarctic 
precipitation during the 21st century are very likely with projected percentage increases that are much higher 
than most sub-polar regions of the world (Figure Atlas.32).    
 
*Floods and heavy precipitation:*  Observations and model projections indicate high confidence in 
increasing Arctic river runoff in response to increasing total precipitation (Box et al., 2019; Durocher et al., 
2019; Meredith et al., 2019) with a shift toward earlier meltwater flooding (AMAP, 2017b).  Higher Arctic 
precipitable water totals are also connected with observed increases in heavy precipitation and convective 
activity (high confidence) (Ye et al., 2015; Kharin et al., 2018; Chernokulsky et al., 2019). Higher flood 
magnitudes are also driven by future increases in rain-on-snow event days, amounts, and runoff, which are 
more significant in the Arctic than in mid-latitudes (where seasonal snow cover is often further reduced) 
(AMAP, 2017b; Il Jeong and Sushama, 2018).  
 
*Landslide and snow avalanche:*  There is a growing number of studies on mass movements in polar 
regions.  Although there is low confidence in widespread observational trends for landslides or snow 
avalanches, a rise in the number of future landslides is supported by strong links to increases in heavy 
precipitation, glacier retreat, and thawing of ice-rich permafrost that can lead to retrogressive thaw slumps in 
Arctic regions (Kokelj et al., 2015; Derksen et al., 2018; Lewkowicz and Way, 2019; Patton et al., 2019; 
Ward Jones et al., 2019) (Section 2.3.2.5).  
 
*Aridity and drought:*  Recent decades have seen a general decrease in Arctic aridity with projections 
indicating a continuing trend toward reduced aridity (high confidence) as increased moisture transport leads 
to higher precipitation, humidity and streamflow (Meredith et al., 2019) and a corresponding decrease in dry 
days (Khlebnikova et al., 2019b). There is low confidence overall of recent or projected drought changes in 
polar regions (Section 11.9) even as increasing evidence shows that drainage from permafrost thaw, higher 
potential evapotranspiration, and changing seasonal patterns of melt have caused lake reduction and soil 
moisture deficits in several areas that match with projections of future drought increase despite overall 
precipitation increases (Andresen and Lougheed, 2015; Bring et al., 2016; Spinoni et al., 2018a; Feng et al., 
2019; Finger Higgens et al., 2019).  
 
*Fire weather:* Fire season lengthened from 1979-2015 over Arctic portions of North America (Jain et al., 
2017), corresponding also to a 1975-2015 increase in lightning-ignited fires in Northwestern North America 
(Girardin et al., 2013; Veraverbeke et al., 2017). Abatzoglou et al. (2019) climate model simulations project 
significant fire weather index increases in boreal forests of Arctic Europe, Arctic Russia and Northeast North 
America (medium confidence). Trends toward more frequent fires in tundra regions are expected to continue, 
driven in particular by increasing potential evapotranspiration and changes in vegetation (high confidence) 
(Hu et al., 2015; AMAP, 2017b; Young et al., 2017).   
 
 
### 12.4.9.3  Wind 
 
*Mean wind speed and severe storm:*  There is medium confidence of mean wind decrease over the Russian 
Arctic, Greenland and Iceland and Arctic Northeast North America (Karnauskas et al., 2018a; Jung and 
Schindler, 2019), but low confidence of changes in the other Arctic regions and Antarctica. Bintanja et al. 
(2014) projected that a strengthening of the Southern Annular Mode would decrease easterlies along 
Antarctica’s coasts with only small changes in katabatic winds (although this effect may diminish with 
stratospheric ozone recovery). In contrast, Gorter et al. (2014) regional climate model projections indicated a 
reduction in mean winds over the interior of Greenland by RCP4.5 2100 while coastal winds increase. 
Reanalysis data and climate models indicate few coherent regional trends of polar cyclone frequency or 
relationships with cyclone depth and size (Akperov et al., 2018, 2019; Day and Hodges, 2018; Zahn et al., 
2018).   
 
 
### 12.4.9.4  Snow and ice  
 
*Snow:* Atlas.11.1 identified likely increases in surface mass balance (driven by snowfall) across Antarctica in 
the 20th century (medium confidence).  In the Arctic, overall snow extent and seasonal duration are projected 
to continue recent declines (high confidence), although mid-winter snowpack increases in some of the 
coldest and high-elevation locations given higher precipitation totals (medium confidence) (Bring et al., 
2016; Danco et al., 2016; AMAP, 2017; Meredith et al., 2019) (9.5.3; Atlas.11.2; Atlas.9). Higher 
temperatures result in a higher percentage of Arctic precipitation falling as rain (particularly in fall and 
spring) (high confidence), with most land regions (outside of Greenland and Antarctica) becoming 
dominated by rainfall (more than 50% of total precipitation) by RCP8.5 2100 (Bintanja and Andry, 2017; 
Irannezhad et al., 2017).  
 
*Glacier and ice sheet:* Section 9.5.1 and Section 2.3.2.3 found that glaciers have lost mass in all polar 
regions since 2000 (high confidence), and Section 9.4 assessed high confidence in Greenland ice sheet mass 
losses since 1980 and Antarctic Ice Sheet losses since 1992 (dominated by West Antarctica with losses in 
parts of East Antarctica in the past two decades).  New simulations from GlacierMIP (Marzeion et al., 2020) 
indicate glaciers in Iceland will lose 31 ± 35%, 41 ± 46% and 53 ± 45% of their mass in 2015 by the end of 
the century for RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. Marzeion et al. (2020) projected mass 
losses (high confidence) for those same scenarios in the Greenland Periphery: 22 ± 23%, 29 ± 26%, and 42 ± 
28%; Svalbard: 35 ± 34%, 50 ± 36%, and 66 ± 35%; Russian Arctic: 26 ± 26%, 38 ± 28%, and 52 ± 30%; 
Northern Arctic Canada: 12 ± 13%, 18 ± 12%, and 27 ± 18%; Southern Arctic Canada: 23 ± 27%, 33 ± 29%, 
and 48 ± 32%; and Antarctic Periphery: 7 ± 12%, 13 ± 10%, and 16 ± 19%. Areas with receding glaciers are 
also potentially vulnerable to glacial lake outburst floods (Harrison et al., 2018). 
 
*Permafrost:*  Observations from recent decades (assessed in Section 9.5.2 and Section 2.3.2.5) show 
increases in permafrost temperature (very high confidence) and active layer thickness (medium confidence) 
across the Arctic (AMAP, 2017; Markon et al., 2018; Biskaborn et al., 2019; Derksen et al., 2019; 
Farquharson et al., 2019; Meredith et al., 2019; Romanovsky et al., 2020). Section 9.5.2 noted that 
observations of active layer thickness in Antarctica are too limited to assess long-term trends (see also 
Biskaborn et al., 2019; Hrbáček et al., 2018). Future projections indicate continuing increases in permafrost 
temperature and active layer thickness with loss of permafrost across the Arctic (Section 9.5.2). Streletskiy et 
al. (2019) noted that changes to Russian permafrost temperature and active layer thickness are most 
pronounced in areas where permafrost is continuous (underlying >90% of landmass). CMIP5 analyses by 
Slater and Lawrence (2013) projected that, by RCP8.5 2100, shallow (<3 m) permafrost would be most 
probable only in portions of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and the Russian Arctic coastal and eastern 
upland regions.   
 
*Sea ice:* Consistent with the SROCC (Meredith et al., 2019), Section 9.3.1 and Section 2.3.2.1.1 assess very 
high confidence that Arctic sea ice thickness, extent, and average age have significantly decreased over the 
past four decades with largest declines in September (when sea ice is at an annual minimum). Declines in 
landfast ice are most rapid in the Laptev Sea (Selyuzhenok et al., 2015), are breaking perennial landfast ice 
blocking ocean channels (‘ice plugs’) in the Canadian Archipelago (Pope et al., 2017), and declining in the 
cold season by 7% decade-1 across the Arctic (1976-2007) (Yu et al., 2014). Observed trends and projections 
suggest that perennial sea ice is being replaced by thin, seasonal ice, although multi-year ice will persist 
above the Canadian Archipelago and drift into sea transportation lanes (Howell et al., 2016; Derksen et al., 
2018). Trends from 1979-2013 show slightly earlier spring melt for Arctic sea ice, but substantially-delayed 
fall freeze up and a melt season lengthened by more than 3 days decade-1 off northern Alaska and Canada 
with the exception of portions of the Bering Sea (Parkinson, 2014; Stroeve et al., 2014). Section 9.3.2 
assessed low confidence in long-term trends in sea ice extent or thickness near Antarctica.   
 
Future declines in Arctic sea ice are virtually certain, although there is low confidence in declines of 
Antarctic sea ice given dynamical processes in the Southern Ocean and the recovery of stratospheric ozone 
(Section 9.3; Meredith et al., 2019). Projections of an ‘ice-free’ Arctic vary depending on definitions 
representing transportation needs, however Laliberté et al. (2016) noted that the median of 42 CMIP5 models 
projected <5% sea ice for the month of September by 2050, with equivalent conditions for the entirety of the 
August-October period by 2090. Section 9.3.1 assessed high confidence that practically ice-free conditions 
(<1 million km2 in the September mean) would likely first appear before 2050 even under strong mitigation 
scenarios (Sigmond et al., 2018; Stroeve and Notz, 2018; Notz and SIMIP, 2020).  
 
*Lake and river ice:*  There is high confidence in observations of significant declines in seasonal ice cover 
thickness and duration over most Arctic lakes, with many lakes projected to lose more than month of ice 
cover by mid-century (medium confidence) (Meredith et al., 2019; Sharma et al., 2019). Some lakes that 
previously froze to the bottom (‘bedfast’) now maintain liquid bottom water year round, and others shift 
from perennial to seasonal ice cover (Surdu et al., 2016; Engram et al., 2018).  Yang et al. (2020) identified a 
decline in Arctic cold-season river ice extent in satellite observations (particularly in Alaska) and projected 
reductions in average Northern Hemisphere seasonal river ice duration of 6.10 ± 0.08 days per degree global 
surface air temperature.   
 
*Heavy snowfall and ice storm:* There is limited evidence of changes in heavy snowfall due to competing 
influences of shortened snowfall seasonality with more intense (and larger overall) precipitation in the 
Arctic. Episodic heavy snowfall trends in Antarctica are difficult to separate from large interannual 
variability (limited evidence) (Gorodetskaya et al., 2014, Turner et al., 2020).  Limited evidence also hinders 
clear signals in ice storms, although warming shifts the freezing line (around which ice storms occur) 
poleward and upslope (Bintanja and Andry, 2017). Groisman et al. (2016) used 40 years of observations to 
identify an increase of freezing rain events in Norway, North America, and Eastern and Western Russia. 
Increases in wintertime rainfall have led to more frequent development of difficult wildlife and livestock 
grazing conditions as basal ice conditions coat the ground below snowpack (Peeters et al., 2019).  
 
 
### 12.4.9.5  Coastal and oceanic 
 
*Relative sea level:* Satellite altimetry and tide data show that relative sea levels (with glacial isostatic 
adjustment) are rising in Arctic Europe and Northwest North America, declining in portions of Southern 
Alaska and Arctic Northeast North America and no clear trend in Greenland and Arctic Russia (Sweet et al., 
2018; Rose et al., 2019), which is broadly consistent with findings in Oppenheimer et al. (2019). Areas with 
low or negative change have substantial land uplift counteracting the global mean sea level trend (Greenan et 
al., 2018; Sweet et al., 2018; Madsen et al., 2019). SROCC projections indicate high confidence in future 
rises in relative sea level for all Arctic regions other than areas of substantial land uplift in Northeastern 
Canada, the west coast of Greenland, and narrow portions of West Antarctica (Oppenheimer et al., 2019).   
 
*Coastal flooding and erosion:*  Higher sea levels and reduced coastal sea ice protection will increase future 
extreme sea levels in the Arctic (high confidence for Arcitc NEU, RAR, and Arctic NWN; medium 
confidence for GIC and Arctic NEN given glacial isostatic adjustment).  Vousdoukas et al. (2018) project 
that the current 1:100 yr extreme total water level would have median return periods of 1:20 yrs – 1:50 yrs 
by 2050, increasing to 1:5 yrs – 1:20 yrs by 2100 under RCP4.5 along nearly the entire Arctic coastline by 
2100 (excluding GIC for which projections are not available).  Projections for RCP8.5 indicate that the 
present day 1:100 yr ETWL would have median return periods of 1:10 yrs – 1:50 yrs 2050 and would occur 
once every 5 years (or more frequently).  Arctic coastal erosion is also expected to increase with climate 
change (medium confidence; high agreement but limited evidence of projections), accelerated in some 
regions by subsurface permafrost thaw and increased wave energy (Gibbs and Richmond, 2015; Fritz et al., 
2017; Oppenheimer et al., 2019; Casas-Prat and Wang, 2020).  A longer ice-free season for the RCP8.5 
2080s is projected to help drive more than 100 m of shoreline retreat in Northwest North America Arctic 
coastal communities (Melvin et al., 2017; Greenan et al., 2019; Magnan et al., 2019). Assessment of coastal 
flooding and erosion changes in Antarctica are limited by a lack of studies.  
 
*Marine heatwave:*  Recent years have seen marine heatwaves and increasing extreme coastal SSTs in Arctic 
systems (Lima and Wethey, 2012; Collins et al., 2019; Frölicher, 2019). Projections show increases in 
marine heatwave intensity, frequency, and duration will be larger over the Arctic Ocean than mid-latitude 
oceans due in part to low interannual variability under current sea ice (high confidence).  Frölicher et al. 
(2018) used 12 CMIP5 models to project median MHW days increasing about 25-fold and 50-fold at the 2℃ 
and 3.5℃ GWLs in response to mean ocean warming and sea ice loss, and the smallest global changes still 
being increases in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica (see also Cross-chapter Box 9.1).   
 
*Climate change has caused and will continue to induce enhanced warming trend, increasing heat-
related extremes and decreasing cold spells and frosts in the Arctic (high confidence), with similar 
changes in Antarctica but medium confidence for extreme heat increases and West Antarctic frost 
change decreases and low confidence for cold spell changes and East Antarctica frost.  The water cycle 
is projected to intensify in polar regions, leading to more rainfall, higher river flood potential and 
more intense precipitation (high confidence). Projections indicate reductions in glaciers and sea ice at 
both poles, with enhanced permafrost warming, decreasing permafrost extent, and decreasing 
seasonal duration and extent of snow cover in the Arctic (high confidence) even as some of the coldest 
regions will see higher total snowfall given increased precipitation (medium confidence). Projections 
indicate relative sea level rises in Polar regions (high confidence), with the exception of regions with 
substantial land uplift including Northeast North America (high confidence), Western Greenland, the 
Northern Baltic Sea, and portions of West Antarctica. Higher sea levels also contribute to high 
confidence for projected increases of Arctic coastal flooding and higher coastal erosion (aided by sea 
ice loss) (medium confidence) with lower confidence for those CIDs in regions with substantial land 
uplift (Arctic Northeast North America and Greenland).*   
 
<tableref>12.11</tableref> 
 
## 12.4.10 Specific zones and hotspots 
 
This section focuses on CIDs affecting specific zones heightened vulnerability and coherent characteristics 
that cut across traditional continental regions (see also Section 12.3). It is designed to match the structure of 
the cross-chapter papers in the WGII report, although polar regions were addressed in more extensive detail 
in 12.4.8 and 12.4.9 and the Mediterranean Region will not be handled separately given that its climatic 
impact-drivers are discussed in Sections 12.4.1 and 12.4.5 as well as in Cross-Chapter Box 10.3. 
 
### 12.4.10.1 Hotspots of biodiversity (land, coasts and oceans) 
 
Hotspots of biodiversity are defined by the AR6 WGII as “geographic areas with exceptionally high richness 
of species, including rare (endemic) species” (WGII Cross-Chapter Paper 1). The AR6 assessment is based 
on 238 distinctive regions often called the “Global 200 ecoregions” (Olson and Dinerstein, 2002). 
 
Mean temperature increase is a major climatic impact-driver for biodiversity hotspots, and it is very likely 
that it will affect all hotspot areas identified in the literature, at various rates in all climate scenarios, except 
those located in the North Atlantic where warming is uncertain (see Chapter 4). Terrestrial ecosystems will 
experience an enhanced warming compared to ocean ecosystems, because land temperatures are warming 
faster than ocean temperatures (Chapter 4). Marine ecoregions will experience ocean acidification and 
temperatures that increase faster in high latitudes (high confidence), but critical temperature and oxygen 
thresholds are projected to be crossed earlier (by mid-century RCP8.5) in tropical areas (Hughes et al., 
2017a; Bruno et al., 2018). A warming trend is also expected for freshwater ecosystems, with different local 
magnitudes due to combined effects of groundwater system inertia as well as hydrology changes (Knouft and 
Ficklin, 2017). In tropical land areas, because interannual temperature variability is weak compared to 
changes, the temperature distribution range is likely to be shifted to a very different range in all projection 
scenarios, with unprecedented values relative to preindustrial. High climate velocities are particularly 
noteworthy for biodiversity hotspots given complex ecosystem dynamics and niche climates not easily 
replicated under shifted geographies (Burrows et al., 2014; Halpern et al., 2015; Dobrowski and Parks, 
2016). In some regions (Central Africa, Amazon, South East Asia) the mean temperature change is already 
beyond the normal range of variations as it has reached levels higher than 3 (and up to 6) times larger than 
the standard deviation of the interannual variations (Hawkins et al., 2020). Together with global warming, 
land and marine heat waves are very likely to increase in the future climate in biodiversity hotspots (Sections 
12.4.1-12.4.7). 
 
There is low confidence in broad patterns of future drying or wet trends across the land and freshwater 
biodiversity hotspots from the humid tropics, although drying trends have been detected and predicted in 
parts of the Amazon (Fu et al., 2013; Boisier et al., 2015). There is medium confidence (limited evidence, 
high agreement) that in several regions the length of the dry season has already increased and is projected to 
further increase in some parts of the Mediterranean, Amazonia and sub-Saharan Africa (S. Debortoli et al., 
2015; Dunning et al., 2018; Hochman et al., 2018; Saeed et al., 2018). Longer dry seasons also extend the 
seasonal length and geographical extent of fire weather in all future scenarios (medium  confidence) (Jolly et 
al., 2015; Abatzoglou et al., 2019).  
 
*In conclusion, biodiversity hotspots located around the world will each face unique challenges in 
climatic impact-drivers changes. However, heat, drought and length of dry season, wildfire weather, 
sea surface temperature and deoxygenation are relevant drivers to terrestrial and freshwater 
ecosystems, and have marked increasing trends.* 
 
 
### 12.4.10.2 Cities and settlements by the sea 
 
Cities and settlements (C&S) by the sea are exposed to specific climate and climate change patterns and to 
compound coastal hazard risks (AR6 WGII Cross-chapter paper 2). AR5 WGII found that, in general, “urban 
climate change-related risks are increasing (including rising sea levels and storm surges, heat stress, extreme 
precipitation, inland and coastal flooding, landslides, drought, increased aridity, water scarcity, and air 
pollution)”. Since AR5 a number of studies have been carried out to understand urban climate and its 
change. Box 10.3 identified a continuing strong role of the urban heat island in amplifying heat extremes in 
cities, although changes in the urban heat island are an order of magnitude smaller than projected localized 
warming trends (very high confidence). 
 
Coastal cities’ proximity to the sea somewhat mitigates the effect of urban heat islands (high confidence) 
(Salvati et al., 2017; Santamouris et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018b; Martinelli et al., 2020). Cities and 
settlements by the sea typically experience higher humidity levels than inland regions, combining with heat 
to enhance heat stress and induce exceedance of critical heat stress thresholds for outdoor activities, with 
potential enhanced exposure to heat for informal settlements (Wang et al., 2019b). Such threshold 
exceedances are projected to increase for many coastal areas (high confidence), including the Persian Gulf 
where heat stress is projected to be extreme (Pal and Eltahir, 2016; Ahmadalipour and Moradkhani, 2018), 
and some low-lying areas in Europe such as the Po Valley and coastal Mediterranean areas (Coppola et al., 
2021a) (Schwingshackl et al., 2021) (see also the heat stress index shown in Figure 12.4d-f). 
 
Climate change related variations in oceanic drivers (e.g., relative sea level, storm surge, ocean waves), 
combined with tropical cyclones, extreme precipitation and river flooding, are expected to lead to more 
frequent and more intense coastal flooding and erosion (very high confidence) impacting C&S located 
especially in low elevation coastal zones and mega-deltas (Chan et al., 2012, 2018; Karymbalis et al., 2012; 
Hemer et al., 2013; Aerts et al., 2014; Neumann et al., 2015a; Ranasinghe, 2016; Hauer et al., 2016; Hinkel 
et al., 2018; Mavromatidi et al., 2018; Marcos et al., 2019) (See also Sections 12.3, 12.4.1-12.4.7 and 
12.4.9). Coastal erosion and flooding also pose challenges to critical infrastructure such as roads, subway 
tunnels, electricity and phone networks, wastewater management plants and buildings (Grahn and Nyberg, 
2017; Pregnolato et al., 2017). Compound flooding due to simultaneous storm surges and high river flows 
have been found to be increasingly frequent in several cities and/or low-lying areas in Europe and the U.S.A. 
(Wahl et al., 2015; Paprotny et al., 2018; Bevacqua et al., 2019; Ganguli and Merz, 2019) (high confidence). 

Chapter 11 found that the frequency of such compound flood events is projected to increase (high 
confidence). In addition to sea level rise induced changes, many C&S by the sea are in regions where tropical 
cyclones are projected to become more intense and frequent (high confidence) (Section 11.7). 
 
The SROCC report highlighted coastal settlements in the Arctic as being particularly exposed to several CID 
changes (Magnan et al., 2019). Enhanced waves due to extended season of sea ice retreat are projected to 
foster coastal flooding and erosion (Gudmestad, 2018; Casas-Prat and Wang, 2020) (Section 12.4.9). Climate 
change is also affecting sea ice quality and season length along coasts of the Arctic ocean where populations 
depend on sea ice for hunting or transportation (Pearce et al., 2015) (Section 12.4.9). 
 
*In summary, coastal cities and settlements are particularly affected by a number of climatic impact-
drivers that have already changed and will continue to change whatever the emission scenario.  These 
include increases in extreme heat, pluvial floods, coastal erosion and coastal flood (high confidence). 
Increasing relative sea level compounding with increasing tropical cyclone storm surge and rainfall 
intensity will increase the probability of coastal city flooding (high confidence). Arctic coastal 
settlements are particularly exposed to climate change due to sea ice retreat (high confidence).* 
 
 
### 12.4.10.3 Deserts and semi-arid areas 
 
Drylands, which include hyper arid, arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas (IPCC, 2019c), lie on all 
continents and cover 46% of the global land area and host over a third of the current population (Olsson et 
al., 2019) . Huang et al. (2016) found that aridity changes have helped expand dryland area by ~4% from 
1948 to 2004, with the largest expansion of drylands occurring in semi-arid regions since the early 1960s. 
Section 4.5.1 assessed high confidence of a future poleward expansion of the Hadley cell, leading to a 
poleward shift of dryland areas in all scenarios considered. There is no evidence of a future global trend in 
aridification of drylands (IPCC, 2019a), but high confidence of aridification in some areas (Mediterranean, 
Central America, South Africa) (IPCC, 2019a) (see also Figure 12.4j-l). However, drivers of desertification 
largely include land cover changes and land use management, along with climate change (IPCC, 2019a). 
 
Warming temperatures and extreme heat are major climatic impact-drivers with multiple potential impacts 
on societies, health, and habitability in semi-arid and arid regions that are already near physiological limits 
for outdoor activities. Semi-arid regions will very likely undergo a warming in all future scenarios (Chapter 
4; Atlas) and likely undergo an increase in duration, magnitude and frequency of heatwaves (Chapter 11) 
(see also Figure 12.4a-c). It is likely that heat stress will be much more intense by the end of the century in 
many areas under all scenarios, such as deserts and semi-arid zones in Asia (Murari et al., 2015; Mishra et 
al., 2017b), Australia and Africa (Dosio et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2017; Schwingshackl et al., 2021; Xia et al., 
2016; Zhao et al., 2015a), with consequences on labour productivity with respect to very heat-humidity 
conditions (see also Figure 12.4d-f).  
 
Drought is another major climatic impact-driver for semi-arid areas, imposing major challenges on 
agriculture given existing water availability constraints (Kusunose and Lybbert, 2014; Barlow et al., 2016; 
Wolski et al., 2018). Over the period 1961-2013, the annual area of drylands in drought has increased, on 
average by slightly more than 1% per year, with large inter-annual variability (Olsson et al., 2019). In 
general, droughts have increased in several arid and semi-arid areas over the last decades (medium 
confidence), and are likely to increase in the future as indicated by a number of indices calculated from 
climate (Liu et al., 2018b; Zkhiri et al., 2019; Coppola et al., 2021b; Driouech et al., 2021)(see also Figure 
12.4j-l).  
 
Deserts and semi-arid areas are prone to dust storms, which can drive impacts on health and several other 
sectors (Zhang et al., 2016b; Tong et al., 2017). SRCCL indicated that the evolution of dust under climate 
change is uncertain (Mirzabaev et al., 2019), and there is a lack of evidence and agreement of a change in 
their frequency or intensity so far in most regions (Sections 12.4.1-12.4.9). Model projections of future 
changes in dust are hindered by the uncertainties in future regional wind and precipitation as the climate 
warms (Evan et al., 2016), in the effect of CO2 fertilization on source extent (Huang et al., 2017), and in the 
impact of human activities upon the land surface (Ginoux et al., 2012) (see Chapter 10). Projected trends on 
dust storms and dust loads in deserts and semi-arid areas vary from region to region. Dust loadings are 
expected to decrease over most of the Sahara and Sahel (low confidence) (Section 12.4.1), increase over 
Mexico and Southwestern U.S. (medium confidence) (Section 12.4.6), and there is low confidence of a future 
trend due to climate change in other continents (Sections 12.4.2-12.4.5). 
 
*In conclusion, desert and semi-arid areas are strongly affected by climatic impact-drivers such as 
extreme heat, drought and dust storms. Heat hazards are very likely increasing in all future climate 
scenarios, but broadly consistent desert and semi-arid region changes for other climatic impact-
drivers’ future evolution remains uncertain.* 
 
 
### 12.4.10.4 Mountains 
 
Mountains cover about 30% of the land areas on Earth (not counting Antarctica) and deliver a number of 
vital services to humanity (IPCC, 2019b) (WGII Cross-chapter paper 5). Climate change in high mountains 
was addressed in the SROCC, which emphasized changes in several climatic impact-drivers, such as: an 
observed general decline in low-elevation snow cover, glaciers and permafrost (high confidence), which 
induced changes in natural hazards such as decrease in slope stability (high confidence), changes to the 
frequency of glacial lake outbursts (limited evidence), and climate effects on other hazards (avalanche, rain-
on-snow floods) with various degrees of confidence (Hock et al., 2019). 
 
There is a growing body of literature indicating elevation-dependent warming (EDW; different rates of 
warming by altitude although not necessarily increasing with altitude) in several mountain regions but not 
globally (Hock et al., 2019; Pepin et al., 2019; Ahmed et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020a; Williamson et al., 2020; 
You et al., 2020; Micu et al., 2021). Statistically significant elevational enhancement to long-term trends in 
maximum near-surface air temperatures and diurnal temperature range were observed in southern central 
Himalaya and in the Swiss Alps (Rottler et al., 2019; Thakuri et al., 2019). Aguilar-Lome et al. (2019) 
reported that winter daytime land surface temperatures in the Andean region between 7°S and 20°S show the 
strongest trends at higher elevations: +1.7°C per decade above 5000 masl. Palazzi et al. (2019) identified 
changes in albedo and downward thermal radiation as key drivers of EDW according to the simulation 
outputs of a high-spatial resolution model in three important mountainous areas: the Colorado Rocky 
Mountains, the Greater Alpine Region and the Himalayas-Tibetan Plateau, but mechanisms for EDW remain 
complex (Hock et al., 2019). Warming is also affecting mountain lake surface temperatures, increasing 
probabilities of ice-free winters and the frequency and duration of “lake heatwaves” (O’Reilly et al., 2015; 
Woolway et al., 2020, 2021) (high confidence) with a high variability from lake to lake. 
 
EDW could speed up the observed, rapid upward shifts of the Freezing Level Height (FLH) in several 
mountainous regions of the world and lead to faster changes in the snowline, the glacier equilibrium-line 
altitude and the snow/rain transition height (high confidence). In the Indus, Ganges and Brahmaputra basins 
in Asia, the FLH is projected to rise at a rate of 4.4 to 10.0 m yr<sup>-1</sup> under RCP8.5 (Viste and Sorteberg, 2015). 
In the Argentinian Andes, FLH is projected under RCP8.5 to move up more than twice as much by 2070 as 
during the entire Holocene under the worst case scenario (Drewes et al., 2018). On the western slope of the 
subtropical Andes (30°-38°S) in central Chile, the mean value of the free tropospheric height of the 0°C 
isotherm under wet conditions is projected to be close to or higher than the upper quartile of the distribution 
in the current climate, towards the end of the century and under RCP8.5 (Mardones and Garreaud, 2020). In 
the Alps and the Pyrenees, Spandre et al. (2019) projected a rise in the natural snow elevation of 200 to 300 
m and 400 to 600 m by mid-century under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively. In the same region, the 
environmental equilibrium-line altitude is projected to exceed the maximum elevation of 69%, 81% and 92% 
of the glaciers by the end of the century under RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5, respectively (Žebre et al., 2021). 
 
Orographic effects enhance convection and stratiform heavy precipitation (due to uplift) and make 
mountains prone to extreme precipitation events. These events are projected to increase in major 
mountainous regions (Alps, parts of the Andes, British Columbia, Northwest North America, Calabria, 
Carpathian, Hindu-Kush-Himalaya, Rockies, Umbria; medium to high confidence depending on location), 
with potential cascading consequences of floods, landslides and lake outbursts in mountainous areas in all 
scenarios (medium confidence) (Geertsema et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2015; Gaire et al., 2015; Kharuk et al., 
2016; Syed and Al Amin, 2016; Ciabatta et al., 2016; Gariano and Guzzetti, 2016; Jurchescu et al., 2017; 
Rajczak and Schär, 2017; Cloutier et al., 2017; Gądek et al., 2017; Alvioli et al., 2018; Schlögl and Matulla, 
2018; Coe et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2019a; Handwerger et al., 2019; Hock et al., 2019; Patton et al., 2019; 
Vaidya et al., 2019; Kirschbaum et al., 2020; Coppola et al., 2021b) (Sections 12.4.1-12.4.9, Chapter 11).  
 
Declines in low-elevation snow depth and seasonal extent are projected for all SSP-RCPs (see Sections 
12.4.1-6), along with reductions in mountain glacier surface area, increases in permafrost temperature, 
decreases in permafrost thickness, changes in lake and river ice, changes in the amount and seasonality of 
streamflows and hydrologic droughts in snow-dominated and glacier-fed river basins (e.g., in Central Asia; 
Sorg et al., 2014; Reyer et al., 2017) (medium confidence), and decreases in the stability of mountain slopes 
and snowfields. Glacier recession could lead to the creation of new glacial lakes in places like the Himalaya-
Karakoram region; (Linsbauer et al., 2016) and in Alaska and Canada (Carrivick and Tweed, 2016; Harrison 
et al., 2018) (medium confidence). With increasing temperature and precipitation these can increase the 
occurrence of glacier lake outburst floods and landslides over moraine-dammed lakes (Carey et al., 2012; 
Rojas et al., 2014; Iribarren Anacona et al., 2015; Cook et al., 2016; Haeberli et al., 2017a; Kapitsa et al., 
2017; Narama et al., 2018; Wilson et al., 2018; Drenkhan et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020a) (high confidence). 
 
*In conclusion, mountains face complex challenges from specific climatic impact-drivers drastically 
influenced by climate change: regional elevation-dependent warming (high confidence), low-to-mid-
altitude snow cover and snow-season decrease even as some high elevations see more snow (high 
confidence), glacier mass reduction and permafrost thawing (high confidence), and increases in 
extreme precipitation and floods in most parts of major mountain ranges (medium confidence).* 
 
 
### 12.4.10.5 Tropical forests 
 
Tropical forests, which are among the world’s most biologically diverse ecosystems, are essentially located 
in Central and South America, Africa and South-East Asia. AR5 and SR1.5 indicated several specific 
climatic impact-driver changes that are particularly important to tropical forests: mean temperature increase, 
long-term drying trends (including shifts in the length of the dry season), prolonged drought, wildfires and 
surface CO2 increase for inland forests (IPCC, 2013, 2018). SRCCL assessed an enhanced risk and severity 
of wildfires in tropical rainforests (high confidence), but fires are not only natural and also due to 
deforestation and other human influences (IPCC, 2019a). 
 
Temperature is rising in all tropical regions covered with forests and will very likely continue to rise, 
reaching levels unprecendented in recent decades as the temperature trends rapidly emerge from weak 
historical interannual variability (12.4.1-4; 12.5.2) (see Chapter 4, Atlas).  
 
Regional patterns of increasing drought or unusual wet and dry periods are predicted with agreement over 
many climate models such as over the Amazon basin (Boisier et al., 2015; Duffy et al., 2015; Zulkafli et al., 
2016; Coppola et al., 2021b). There is medium confidence (limited evidence, high agreement) that in several 
tropical-forest regions the dry season length has increased (Amazonia, West Africa) (Fu et al., 2013; S. 
Debortoli et al., 2015; Saeed et al., 2017; Dunning et al., 2018; Wadsworth et al., 2019), and low confidence 
(limited evidence) that deforestation influences the shift in the onset of the wet season in South Amazonia 
(Leite-Filho et al., 2019). In contrast, the wet season is increasing in Northern Australia Tropical Forests 
(Catto et al., 2012). 
 
Tropical forests typically reach peak fire weather conditions in the dry season (Taufik et al., 2017), in 
particular during long-lived droughts (Brando et al., 2014; Marengo et al., 2018), with consequences on tree 
mortality, forest and carbon sink loss (Brando et al., 2019), and on the hydrological cycle in South America 
(Martinez and Dominguez, 2014; Espinoza et al., 2020). Observations and reanalyses over the past 3-4 
decades, combined into fire risk indices, show that the fire weather season length has been increasing by 
about 20% globally (Jolly et al., 2015), and this index exhibits particularly high trend values over tropical 
forest areas of South and Central America and Africa. There is generally low confidence in future projections 
of general fire weather risk evolution in tropical forests and evolutions depend on the region (Abatzoglou et 
al., 2019). Over the Amazon basin the fire risk increase is emerging well before 2050 while for other 
equatorial forests no significant evolution is found. In Savanna areas the risk increase is found to be more 
general. 
 
*In conclusion, most tropical forests are challenged by a mix of emerging warming trends that are 
particularly large in comparison to historical variability (medium confidence). Water cycle changes 
bring prolonged drought, longer dry seasons, and increased fire weather to many tropical forests, with 
plants also responding to CO2 increases (medium confidence).* 
 
 
# <goto>12.5</goto>  Global perspective on climatic impact-drivers 
 
## 12.5.1  A global synthesis 
 
Section 12.4 assessed changes in climatic impact-drivers by region, primarily based on a large number of 
local, regional-scale studies (even though global studies are also used). This section presents an assessment 
of changes in CID at the global scale. It is based on both a bottom-up synthesis of the results in 12.4, and a 
top-down assessment from global-scale studies undertaken here. Box 12.1 summarizes global-scale CIDs 
with levels of warming. 
 
Global-scale studies use similar indices of climatic impact-drivers across space, although these indices may 
not be always those used at the local or regional scale. Most published global-scale studies concentrate on 
single sectors or climatic impact-drivers, but some take a multi-sectoral perspective (e.g., Warszawski et al., 
2014; Arnell et al., 2016; Mitchell et al., 2017; O’Neill et al., 2018; Arnell et al., 2019a; Schleussner et al., 
2016; Betts et al., 2018; Byers et al., 2018; Mora et al., 2018; O’Neill et al., 2018; Zscheischler et al., 2018). 
Only a few published global-scale studies (e.g., Coppola et al., 2021; Schwingshackl et al., 2021) have used 
CMIP6 scenarios to date. Box 12.1 summarizes global-scale CIDs with levels of warming. 
 
All regions will experience, before 2050, increased warming, an increase of extreme heat and a decrease in 
cold spells, regardless of the emissions trajectory (high confidence). Tropical regions, but also mid latitude 
regions to a lesser extent, will experience an increasing number of days with heat indices crossing dangerous 
thresholds used to characterize heat stress, such as HI>41°C (Figure 12.4). The increase, by the end of 
century, exceeds 100 days per year in most tropical areas under SSP5-8.5 but remains much more limited to 
almost half under SSP1-2.6. Several global-scale studies have shown that high temperature extremes will 
increase everywhere (high confidence) ) (Gourdji et al., 2013; Perkins-Kirkpatrick and Gibson, 2017; 
Harrington et al., 2018; Jones et al., 2018; Lehner et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2018; Tebaldi and Wehner, 2018; 
Arnell et al., 2019; Russo et al., 2019; Schwingshackl et al., 2021), although the change depends on the 
indicator (see also Chapter 11). For example, by 2080, at least 80% of the land surface is expected to 
experience average summer temperatures greater than the historical (1920-2014) maximum with high 
RCP8.5 emissions (Lehner et al., 2018). The areas of rice and maize cropland with damaging extreme 
temperatures during the reproductive season will increase by a factor of three under RCP8.5  (Gourdji et al., 
2013). Heatwaves that are currently considered rare become the norm almost everywhere with high 
emissions by the end of the century (Russo et al., 2014). Heat stress as a combined function of temperature 
and humidity also increases at the global scale, especially with high emissions (e.g. Matthews et al., 2017). 
Growing degree-days and cooling degree-days also increase everywhere (Arnell et al., 2019) with the 
absolute and proportional changes depending on temperature threshold. Increases in temperatures will result 
in reductions in heating degree-days (Arnell et al., 2019; Coppola et al., 2021b) and a widespread reduced 
frequency of cold extremes (high confidence).  
 
Integrating the results of the regional assessments in 12.4 shows that changes in CIDs linked with the water 
cycle or atmospheric dynamics (e.g. storms) vary more among regions, largely due to the spatial pattern of 
changes in atmospheric circulation and changes in precipitation and evaporation (Chapters 8 and 11). There 
is high confidence that heavy precipitation and pluvial floods will be increasing in a majority of land regions, 
primarily due to the well-understood Clausius-Clapeyron relationship describing the increase in moisture 
content with air temperature (Chapters 8 and 11), but there is a large spatial variability in fluvial flood 
hazards. Top-down global-scale studies show that although fluvial flood hazards are projected to decrease in 
regions where there are large reductions in seasonal rainfall totals or where warmer temperatures mean less 
accumulated snow, at the global scale, fluvial flood hazard (characterized as the area affected, size of peak or 
likelihood of an event) is projected to increase substantially through the century (Giuntoli et al., 2015; Arnell 
and Gosling, 2016; Winsemius et al., 2016; Alfieri et al., 2017; Dottori et al., 2018; Arnell et al., 2019). 
Projected changes in agricultural and hydrological drought characteristics are dependent on the indicator 
used to define drought (Section 12.3; Chapter 11), but there is at least medium confidence of an increase in 
the drought hazard in many parts of the world. This is also reflected in global scale studies, with for example 
Naumann et al. (2018) showing that the global mean average drought duration (based on the SPEI index 
which is calculated from the difference between precipitation and potential evaporation) increased from 7 
months with the current climate to 18.5 months for a global warming level of 3oC. The apparent global 
increase in drought occurrence is greater when evaporation is captured in the drought indicator (e.g. SPEI) 
than when the indicator is based on precipitation alone (as in SPI) (Carrão et al., 2018). There is evidence 
that the likelihood of simultaneous events in several locations will increase: (Trnka et al., 2019) found that 
the proportion of wheat-growing areas experiencing simultaneous severe water stress events (based on SPEI) 
in a year increased from 15% under current conditions to up to 60% at the end of the 21st century under high 
emissions. 
 
The regional assessment in 12.4 shows that fire weather is projected in increase with medium or high 
confidence in every continent of the world, including Arctic polar regions. Globally, fire weather is projected 
to increase in future, primarily due to higher temperatures and exacerbated where precipitation reduces. By 
2050, 60% of the global land area would see a significant increase in fire weather under RCP8.5 (Abatzoglou 
et al., 2019). There is less confidence in the projected distribution of change in fire weather across regions in 
global scale studies. For example, (Moritz et al., 2012) projected an increase in fire weather in mid and high 
latitudes but a reduction in the tropics, whilst Yu et al. (2019) and Bedia et al. (2015) projected an increase in 
the tropics. These differences reflect differences in methodologies and fire weather indices adopted in 
different studies. 
 
Integration of the results of 12.4 shows that the total number of tropical cyclones is projected to decrease 
through the 21st century, particularly with high emissions, but the number of very intense tropical cyclones is 
projected to increase in most areas (at least medium confidence) (e.g. Bacmeister et al., 2018) (Chapter 11). 
Furthermore, regions with glaciers will lose glacier mass and regions concerned with snow cover will see a 
reduction in snow depth, the duration, or extent of cover (medium confidence in Polar regions, high 
confidence elsewhere). 
 
Relative sea-level rise is projected in all regions (excepting a few Arctic polar regions) with likelihoods 
varying from very likely to virtually certain depending on the region.  This will increase the frequency of 
extreme sea levels and, depending on the level of coastal flood protection, coastal flooding (Vousdoukas et 
al., 2018; Kirezci et al., 2020).. In terms of globally averaged extreme total water level (ETWL) frequency 
changes, the present-day 1:100 yr event is projected to become 1:30 yr and 1:20 yr events by 2050 under 
RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively. By 2100 the present day 1:100 yr ETWL is projected to become a 1:5 yr 
event under RCP4.5, while under RCP8.5, such events are projected to occur more than once a year 
(Vousdoukas et al., 2018). 
 
There is high confidence that most of the world’s sandy coasts will experience shoreline retreat, in the 
absence of terrestrial or offshore sediment sources. Median projections presented by (Vousdoukas et al., 
2020b) indicate that 13.6% (36,097 km) and 15.2% (40,511 km) of the world’s sandy beaches could retreat 
by more than 100 m by 2050 (relative to 2010) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively, implying a 12% 
increase in severely threatened shoreline length under RCP8.5, relative to RCP4.5. These median projections 
increase to 35.7% (RCP4.5)–49.5% (RCP8.5) (or 95,061 km–131,745 km) by the end of the century, 
implying a 38% increase in severely threatened shoreline length under RCP8.5, relative to RCP4.5.  
 
Figure 12.11 highlights that each region will, with high confidence, experience changes in multiple CIDs, 
challenging the vulnerability of the region and its adaptation and mitigation capacity. All non-polar regions 
with a coastline will see an increase in relative sea level, extreme sea level and coastal erosion, and will also 
see an increase in hot extremes, a decrease in cold extremes, and many will experience an increase in heavy 
precipitation. One cluster of regions – South eastern and western Africa regions, the Mediterranean, North 
Central America, West North America, the Amazon regions, Western South America, and Australia – will 
experience, in addition to the aforementioned globally changing CIDs, increases in either drought/aridity or 
fire weather with high confidence. This will impact upon agricultural resources, infrastructure and health and 
ecosystems. A second cluster of regions including mountainous areas or regions with seasonal snow cover 
will experience (in addition to increases in heat extremes, more intense short-duration rainfall, and increases 
in coastal hazards where coasts exist) reductions in snow and ice cover and/or increases in river flooding in 
many cases (Western, Northwestern, Central and Eastern North America, Arctic regions, Andes regions, 
Europe, Siberia, central and East Asia, Southern Australia and New Zealand) (high confidence). These are 
places where energy production, ski tourism, river transportation, infrastructure could in particular face 
increased risks. 
 
In a few other regions, only a few CIDs are projected to change with high confidence (e.g., Sahara, Central 
Africa, Western Africa, Madagascar, Arabian Peninsula, South eastern South America, New Zealand, Small 
Islands). The lower confidence levels associated with changes in CIDs in these regions can be due either to 
weaker change signals compared to natural variability, or due to limited evidence and model uncertainties 
leading to low agreement, and does not mean that climate change may affect these regions any less than in 
other regions. 
 
*In summary, there is high confidence that all regions of the world will experience changes in several 
climatic impact-drivers by mid-century, albeit at region specific rates of change and confidence levels 
per CID. Consequently, changing CIDs have the potential to affect climate-related risks in all regions 
of the world.*

## 12.5.2  The emergence of climatic impact-drivers across time and scenarios 
 
The emergence of a climate change signal occurs when that signal exceeds some critical threshold (usually 
taken to be a measure of natural variability, see e.g. Hawkins and Sutton, 2012) or when the probability 
distribution of an indicator becomes significantly different to that over a reference period (e.g. Chadwick et 
al., 2019) (see also Section 1.4.2, Chapter 10), in which case external anthropogenic forcings can be detected 
as causal factors. The “time of emergence” (ToE) or “temperature of emergence” is the time or global 
warming level thresholds associated with this exceedance. Emergence is particularly relevant to impacts, 
risks assessment and adaptation because human and natural systems are largely adapted to natural variability 
but may be vulnerable if exposed to changes that go beyond this variability range; this is not to say that 
changes within natural variability have no impact, as occurrence of damaging extremes proves. Emergence 
also informs the timing of adaptation measures. The emergence of a change is always relative to a reference 
period (e.g. the pre-industrial period or a recent past), depending on the framing question. In the former case, 
the goal is to estimate the amplitude of an anthropogenically driven change while in the latter, it is to 
estimate the amplitude of change relative to a baseline that is familiar to stakeholders. Both questions are 
important for risk assessment, but the former may be more directly interpretable in a mitigation context. The 
variability also refers to a time scale, generally interannual to interdecadal. The reader is referred to Section 
1.4.2 and Chapter 10 for more details about how emergence is defined and used in the literature.  
 
Changes in climatic impact-drivers may remain within the range of natural variability or have a time of 
emergence that varies by region and scenario. This section assesses the evidence for the effects of 
anthropogenic climate change on the emergence of changes in CID index, past, resent and future, as 
evidenced by the literature assessed in other chapters, as well as additional literature assessed here, at both 
global and regional scales. In many cases, however, sufficient literature for a robust region by region 
assessment of times of emergence is lacking. The assessment herein is made by CID. Regional emergence 
assessment is reported in Tables 12.3-11 but is undertaken in this section. 
 
ToE estimation must be done with caution given the many sources of inherent uncertainties, such as 
observations representing only a single realization of climate history, internal variability (whose frequency -- 
e.g., annual or decadal --  needs to be precisely defined), model biases, and potential low-frequency changes 
in variability (Chapter 10) (Lehner et al., 2017). In addition, a homogeneous interpretation of multiple 
studies is hampered by heterogeneous methodologies used to calculate emergence. In this section, we assess 
emergence and its confidence level based on such multiple methods as provided by the literature, and unless 
specified otherwise, emergence here refers to S/N>1 (S/N= signal to noise ratio) relative to a preindustrial 
baseline and interannual variability (the “noise”). Furthermore, observed trends and attribution are taken into 
account in combination with climate simulations (historical or projections) for assessing whether a trend has 
already emerged in the historical period. 
 
*Mean air temperature:* Warming of mean annual temperatures has already emerged in all land regions as 
obtained from past observations and confirmed by historical simulations (high confidence) (King et al., 2015; 
Hawkins et al., 2020) (Figure 1.13), with S/N ratios larger than 2. In the current climate, the highest S/N 
ratios exceed 5 over Central Africa, Amazonia, East and South East Asia. Seasonal warming emergence 
depends on the season. Because the temperature variability in the mid-latitudes is higher in winter than in 
summer, the emergence of seasonal warming occurs for summer but not for winter in most of this part of the 
world. In Europe, summer warming has emerged in all regions (medium confidence, medium agreement), 
and in North America, it has emerged only over Eastern and Western regions while in winter there is low 
confidence of an emergence in warming in all regions for both Europe and North America (Lehner et al., 
2017; Hawkins et al., 2020). When considering the climate of the end of the 20th century (i.e. recent past) as 
a baseline, the emergence of mean temperature is projected at very different times depending on the scenario. 
For instance, emergence is reached by 2050 under RCP8.5 in most areas of Europe, Australia or East Asia, 
but it does not occur within the 21st century under RCP2.6 (medium confidence) (Sui et al., 2014; Im et al., 
2020). This means that RCP2.6 is efficient to keep mean temperatures within the recent climate range in the 
mid-latitudes. However, even under RCP2.6, mean temperatures in tropical regions that have not already 
emerged are projected to emerge before 2050 (medium confidence). 
 
*Extreme heat and cold:* Increase in heat extremes have emerged or will emerge in the coming 3 decades in 
most land regions (high confidence) (King et al., 2015; Seneviratne and Hauser, 2020) (Chapter 11), relative 
to the pre-inudtrial period, as found by testing significance of differences in distributions of yearly 
temperature maxima in simulated 20-year periods. In tropical regions, wherever observed changes can be 
established with statistical significance, and in most mid-latitude regions, there is high confidence that hot 
and cold extremes have emerged in the historical period, but only medium confidence elsewhere. In other 
regions emergence is projected at the latest in the first half of the 21st century (high confidence) under 
RCP8.5 at least (King et al., 2015; Seneviratne and Hauser, 2020). Relative to the end of 20th-century 
conditions, changes in humid heat stress as characterized by wet bulb temperature, indicates a ToE as early 
as in the first two decades of the 21st century in RCP8.5 at least in many tropical regions (most of Africa in 
the band [20°S-20°N], South Asia and South-East Asia) (Im et al., 2020) (medium confidence) . By 2050 and 
under RCP8.5, wet bulb temperature is projected to emerge in many other areas such as South Africa, North 
Africa, Europe, and most of Central, Southern, Eastern Asia and Northern and Eastern Australia, while under 
RCP2.6, emergence is either reached later in the century (Europe, Central Asia, Northern Australia), or never 
reached in the century (Im et al., 2020). Decrease of cold spells has already emerged above the interannual 
variability in Australasia, Africa and most of northern South America, and they are projected to emerge 
before 2050 in the Northern mid-latitudes and in southern South America (King et al., 2015) under RCP8.5 
(medium confidence, low evidence and high agreement).  
 
*Mean precipitation:* Over only a few regions mean precipitation changes have emerged in the historical 
period (increase in Northern and Eastern Europe and decrease in West Africa, Amazonia) from observations 
with an S/N ratio larger than 1 (Hawkins et al., 2020) (low confidence). The emergence of increasing 
precipitation before the middle of the 21st century is found across scenarios in Siberian regions, Russian far 
east, northern Europe, Arctic regions and the northernmost parts of North America (high confidence) and 
later in other Northern mid-latitude areas, depending on the scenario, albeit with different methods and 
emergence definitions used in climate projections (Chapter 8) (Giorgi and Bi, 2009; Maraun, 2013; King et 
al., 2015; Akhter et al., 2018; Kumar and Ganguly, 2018; Nguyen et al., 2018; Barrow and Sauchyn, 2019; 
Rojas et al., 2019; Kusunoki et al., 2020; Pohl et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021). Decreases in mean precipitation 
are projected to emerge in parts of Africa  by the middle of trhe century, and later in the Mediterranean and 
southern Australia, but the emergence depends on the scenario, and specific seasons for crop growth 
(Nguyen et al., 2018; Rojas et al., 2019). Mean precipitation does not emerge in any of these regions at 
anytime in the 21st century under RCP2.6, but emerges in all under RCP8.5. ToE under RCP4.5 is projected 
to be around 25 years later relative to RCP8.5 in many of the early emergence regions, highlighting the 
importance of mitigation to gain more time for adaptation. 
 
*Heavy precipitation and floods:* There is low confidence in the emergence of heavy precipitation and 
pluvial and fluvial flood frequency in observations, despite trends that have been found in a few regions 
(Chapter 8, Chapter 11, and across Section 12.4). In climate projections, the emergence of increase in heavy 
precipitation strongly depends on the scale of aggregation (Kirchmeier-Young et al., 2019), with, in general, 
no emergence before a 1.5°C or 2°C warming level, and before the middle of the century (medium 
confidence), but results depend on the method used for the calculation of the ToE (Maraun, 2013; King et al., 
2015; Kusunoki et al., 2020). Emergent increases in heavy precipitation are found in several regions when 
aggregated at a regional scale in Northern Europe, Northern Asia and East Asia, at latest by the end of the 
century in SRES A1B or RCP8.5 scenarios or when considering the decadal variability as a reference 
(medium confidence) (Maraun, 2013; Li et al., 2018e, 2021; Kusunoki et al., 2020). There have been few 
emergence studies for streamflow and flooding, although one study showed emergence of different 
hydrological regimes at different times during the 21st century across the United States (Leng et al., 2016). 
Variability in extreme streamflows from year to year can be high relative to a trend (Zhuan et al., 2018). 
Given the heterogeneity of methods and results, there is only low confidence in the emergence of heavy 
precipitation and flood signals in any region when considering the S/N ratio. 
 
*Droughts, aridity and fire weather:* There is low confidence in the emergence of drought frequency in 
observations, for any type of drought, in all regions. Even though significant drought trends are observed in 
several regions with at least medium confidence (Section 12.4), agricultural and ecological drought indices 
have  interannual variability that dominates trends, as can be seen from their time series (Guo et al., 2018a; 
Spinoni et al., 2019b; Haile et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b) (medium confidence). Studies of the emergence of 
drought with systematic comparisons between trends and variability of indices are lacking, precluding a 
comprehensive assessment of future drought emergence. Historical climate simulations indicate that fire 
weather indices have already emerged in several regions (the Amazon basin, Mediterranean, Central 
America, West and South Africa) (low confidence, low evidence) (Abatzoglou et al., 2019), and emergence is 
projected with low confidence by the middle of the century in several other regions (Southern Australia, 
Siberia, most of Northern America and Europe) when considering several indices together. 
 
*Wind:* Observed mean surface wind speed trends are present in many areas (12.4), but the emergence of 
these trends from the interannual natural variability and their attribution to human-induced climate change 
remains of low confidence due to various factors such as changes in the type and exposure of recording 
instruments, and their relation to climate change is not established. For future conditions, there is limited 
evidence of the emergence of trends in mean wind speeds due to the lack of studies quantifying wind speed 
changes and their interannual variability. The same limitation also holds for wind extremes (severe storms, 
cyclones, dust and sandstorms). 
 
*Snow and ice:* The decrease in the Northern Hemisphere snow cover extent in spring has already emerged 
from natural variability (Section 3.4.2). The snow cover duration period is projected to emerge over large 
parts of Eastern and Western North America and Europe by the mid-century both in spring and autumn, and 
emergence is expected in the second half of the 21st century in the Arctic regions in the high RCP8.5 
scenario (Chapter 9, SROCC) (medium confidence). For snow depth or snow water equivalent, there is low 
confidence (limited evidence) of the emergence of a decrease before 2050 because climate change also 
increases the variability of the snow depth signal, in Europe (Willibald et al., 2020) (Section 3.4.2). 
Terrestrial permafrost is warming worldwide due to climate change (Sections 2.3.2.5, 9.5.2). Due to weak 
interannual variability of permafrost temperatures, terrestrial permafrost warming has emerged above natural 
variability in almost all observed time series of the Northern Hemisphere (Biskaborn et al., 2019) (medium 
confidence, limited evidence, high agreement), but the active layer thickness exhibits considerable 
interannual variability inhibiting evidence for emergence (Chapter 9).  
 
*Sea ice:* Sea ice area decrease in the Arctic in all seasons has already emerged from the interannual 
variability (high confidence) (Chapter 9). By contrast, the Antarctic sea ice area shows no significant trend, 
and therefore no emergence. 
 
For other snow and ice CIDs (heavy snowfall and ice storm, hail, snow avalanche), there is limited evidence 
of emerging signals.  
 
*Relative sea level, coastal flood and coastal erosion:* Near-coast RSLR will emerge before 2050 for 
RCP4.5 along the coasts of all AR6 regions (with coasts) except EAS, RFE, MDG, the southern part of ENA 
and the Antarctic regions (9.6.1.4) (Bilbao et al., 2015) (medium confidence). Under RCP8.5, emergence of 
near-coast RSLR is projected by mid-century along the coasts of all AR6 regions (with coasts), except WAN 
where emergence is projected to occur before 2100 (Section 9.6.1.4) (Lyu et al., 2014) (medium 
confidencce). Emergence studies for ETWL and coastal erosion are lacking and hence it is not currently 
possible to robustly assess emergence in these CIDs. 
 
*Mean ocean temperature and marine heatwave:* The emergence of the sea surface temperature increase 
signal has been observed in global oceans over the last century, and the largest S/N values are found in the 
tropical Atlantic and tropical Indian Oceans (Hawkins et al., 2020).  There is high confidence in the 
widespread occurrence of marine heatwaves in all basins and marginal seas over the last decades (Chapter 
9), but the emergence of this signal above the natural variability has not yet been addressed in detail. 
 
*Ocean acidity, ocean salinity and dissolved oxygen:* The global ocean pH has very likely emerged from 
natural variability for more than 95% of the global open ocean (SROCC, Chapter 2). The regional signals are 
more variable, but in all ocean basins, the signal of ocean acidification in the surface ocean is projected to 
emerge in the early 21st century (Chapter 5). The mean time of emergence for acidity in the coastal 
subtropical to temperate northeast Pacific and northwest Atlantic is above two decades (5.3.5.2) (high 
agreement, medium evidence). Salinity change signals have already emerged with 20–45% of the zonally 
averaged basin in the Atlantic, 20–55% in the Pacific and 25–50% in the Indian Oceans and will be reaching 
35–55% in the Atlantic in 2050 to 55–65% in 2080; 45–65% to 60–75% in the Pacific; 45–65% to 60–80% 
in the Indian Oceans (Silvy et al., 2020) (Chapter 9). Deoxygenization has already emerged in many open 
oceans. The signal is most evident in the Pacific and Southern Oceans but not evident in the North Atlantic 
Ocean (Andrews et al., 2013; Levin, 2018). However, there is medium confidence in the emergence of the 
anthropogenic signal in many other oceanic regions by 2050 (Henson et al., 2017; Levin, 2018).  
 
*There is high confidence that several CID changes have already emerged above natural variability in 
the historical period in many regions (e.g. mean temperature in most regions, heat extremes in tropical 
areas, sea ice, salinity). Heat and cold CIDs (excluding frost) that have not already emerged will 
emerge by 2050 whatever the scenario (medium confidence) in almost all land regions. The emergence 
of increasing precipitation before the middle of the century is also projected in in Siberian regions, 
Russian far east, northern Europe and the northernmost parts of North America and Arctic regions 
across scenarios with the various methods and emergence definitions used (high confidence). Studies 
are missing to properly assess S/N emergence for droughts and for wind CIDs. Arctic sea ice extent 
declines have mostly emerged above noise level (medium to high confidence), and the emergence of 
declining snow cover is expected by the end of the century under RCP8.5. There is medium confidence 
that, under RCP8.5, the anthropogenic forced signal in near coast relative sea-level change will emerge 
by mid-century in all regions with coasts, except in the West Antarctic region where emergence is 
projected to occur before 2100. In all ocean basins, the signal of ocean acidification in the surface 
ocean is projected to emerge before 2050 (high confidence).*

# <goto>12.6</goto>  Climate change information in climate services 
 
Climate services are a significantly evolving source for climate change information to support adaptation, 
mitigation and risk management decisions. As an evolving field, there are multiple definitions of climate 
services (cf. Brasseur and Gallardo, 2016). The Global Framework for Climate Services defines a climate 
service as the provision of climate information to assist decision-making. The service includes appropriate 
engagement from users and providers, is based on scientifically credible information and expertise, has an 
effective access mechanism, and responds to user needs (Hewitt et al., 2012) 
 
IPCC AR5 WGII introduced climate services as bridging the generation and application of climate 
knowledge, also describing their history and concepts (Jones et al., 2014). Since then, this transdisciplinary 
field has been growing rapidly (Brasseur and Gallardo, 2016; Hewitt et al., 2020a) with the social sciences in 
particular pointing out knowledge requirements for co-design and co-development of climate services 
(Larosa and Mysiak, 2019; Daniels et al., 2020; Steynor et al., 2020). Climate services differ from more 
research-driven vulnerability, impacts, and adaptation research in their orientation toward decision support 
(Stone and Meinke, 2005; Ruane et al., 2016; Golding et al., 2019), but overlaps exist (Bruno Soares and 
Buontempo, 2019). Climate services are often targeted at building resilience to climate-related hazards from 
near real-time to seasonal and multi-decadal time horizons, to inform adaptation to climate variability and 
change (Hewitt et al., 2012), widely recognized as an important challenge for sustainable development and 
risk management (Moss et al., 2010; Jones et al., 2014; Vaughan et al., 2018). This section focuses largely 
on climate change timescales (past, present and future), which are the focus of AR6 WGI. 
 
This section introduces the current climate services landscape, assesses climate services practices and 
products related to climate change information and associated challenges. Cross-chapter box 12.2 provides 
concrete examples of climate services. The section builds on the introduction to climate services in Section 
1.6.1.4 and the assessment of regional climate information construction including storylines discussed in 
sections 10.3.4.2, 10.5.3 and Box 10.2. The Atlas supports the provision of climate information across WGs 
by providing interactive maps and further details to the material made publicly accessible for use in climate 
services. WGII (Chapter 17) further elaborates on climate services as enablers for climate risk management.  
 
 
## 12.6.1  Context of climate services  

The idea of climate services is not new and has its roots in meteorology and climatology (Larosa and 
Mysiak, 2019). It can be traced back to the late 1970s and the US National Climate Program Act of 1978 
(Henderson et al., 2016). The development of the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS) after the 
World Climate Conference-3 in Geneva brought international attention and renewed impetus to the climate 
services field (Hewitt et al., 2012). As a result, large investments have been made globally and regionally in 
the development of user-driven climate services. WMO has created Regional Climate Centres (RCCs) to 
facilitate climate service development by regional and national providers (Hewitt et al., 2020a).  The 
European Union declared its ambition to stimulate “the creation of a community of climate services 
application developers and users that matches supply and demand for climate information and prediction”, 
giving primacy to climate services that are user-driven and science-informed (Lourenço et al., 2016), thus 
embracing concepts of co-design, co-development and co-evaluation of climate services (Street, 2016). 
Diverse and action-driven international initiatives allowed climate services to progressively shift from 
mitigation towards adaptation (Larosa and Mysiak, 2019). Opportunities for the development of climate 
services have emerged through the 2015 Agendas (Paris Agreement, Sustainable Development Goals and 
Sendai Framework), Nationally Determined Contributions, National Adaptation Plans, Multilateral 
Development Banks and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (see Chapter 1.2.2).  
 
Scientific advancements in climate services related to meteorology and climatology are still closely linked to 
essential climate variables (Larosa and Mysiak, 2019) and benefit from consistently growing computational 
power, infrastructure and storage capacity to meet the demands of higher spatially and temporally resolved 
climate information (Buontempo et al., 2020). Climate services also focus on impact chains providing 
decision-makers with information on climate change with cross-sectoral impact assessments for adaptation 
(Jacob and Solman, 2017). Today there is a diversity of climate services that involve interpretation, analysis, 
and communication of different sources of climate data, ideally combining different types of knowledge 
(scientific/technical, experiential, indigenous, etc.), to a targeted group of decision-makers (Parris et al., 
2016; Olazabal et al., 2018; Pezij et al., 2019). (Jacobs and Street, 2020) argue that climate services should 
be expanded to also address societal challenges, such as system transformation that includes climate in the 
context of other risks and development challenges.  
 
Climate services are undertaken in public and private sectors at global, regional, national, and local scales 
(Hewitt et al., 2012, 2020b; Cortekar et al., 2020). Intermediaries such as private sector consulting 
companies, national climate service providers as well as research organizations, government agencies or 
academic institutions provide climate services that translate aspects of climate research to the specific 
context of decision-makers (see also Chapter 10.5). The EU Roadmap for Climate Services ( 
an Commission, 2015; Street, 2016) focuses on developing a market for climate services comprising of both 
public and private domains. The GFCS, under the leadership of several United Nations Agencies,  
emphasizes the public domain by supporting national and regional capacity building and development of 
climate services mainly through National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (Hewitt et al., 2012; 
Domingos et al., 2016; Sivakumar and Lucio, 2018; WMO, 2018). There are on-going debates about the 
commercialization of climate services (Brooks, 2013b; WMO, 2015; Webber and Donner, 2017; Hoa, 2018; 
Troccoli et al., 2018; Bruno Soares and Buontempo, 2019; Hewitt et al., 2020a). Some argue that the 
commercialization of climate services is needed to meet the diverse needs of specific clients and to drive 
innovation in the field (Brooks, 2013b; Troccoli, 2018a). Others argue that if climate services shift incentives 
for climate science away from the public interest towards profit-seeking, this will result in less publicly 
accessible and transparent climate information and more private knowledge (Keele, 2019; Tart et al., 2020).  
 
Some climate adaptation planning already use climate information as provided by the IPCC, however, 
depending on the decision context, this information may be too coarse, too broad or too disciplinary to 
directly inform decision-making at the scale where adaptation measures are taken (Howarth and Painter, 
2016; Nissan et al., 2019). Thus, while the role of IPCC is clearly felt as a reference, authoritative, starting 
point, there is a need for complementary information to translate the assessments at the national, local or 
sectoral level (Howarth and Painter, 2016; Kjellström et al., 2016; van den Hurk et al., 2018; Vaughan et al., 
2018). The AR6 Interactive Atlas (see section Atlas.2) does provide a collection of observational data and 
global and regional climate projections. It is designed as a climate service towards the WGI needs and 
beyond to assess the state of the climate by offering data, maps and a level of expert analysis by aggregation 
of results to regions, scenarios and warming levels. 
 
 
## 12.6.2  Assessment of climate services practice and products related to climate change information 

The climate services landscape is fast growing and very broad as reflected in the vast diversity of practices 
and products that can be found in the peer-reviewed literature (very high confidence). However, a large part 
of climate services practices and products is published in ‘grey’ literature (i.e. non-peer reviewed or non-
academic) by private consultancy and non-scientific civil organizations of which many are not in the public 
domain. In addition, the respective climate service context of a specific stakeholder in a sector dictates what 
climate information is required and on what scales and in what format it is most usefully provided. The 
extent and type of engagement between scientists and users is another critical aspect of climate services (see 
Cross-chapter box 12.2 Fig 1, and2section 10.5). The assessment here can thus only provide a partial and 
rather general representation of available practices and products of the evolving climate services field.  
 
User needs and decision making contexts are very diverse and there is no “one size fits all” solution to 
climate services (very high confidence) (Hewitt et al., 2017a; Vincent et al., 2018b). In many cases this 
requires recognizing that stakeholders make decisions through a combination of scientific information and 
additional values (Vanderlinden et al., 2017; Parker and Lusk, 2019) (see also Section 1.2.3 and Section 
10.5.4). The emerging climate service literature may clarify some features of climate information requested 
by users, for instance climatic impact-driver identification and prioritization through stakeholder 
engagement; the specification of thresholds for various regions/sectors; the types of metrics 
(magnitude/intensity, frequency, duration, timing, spatial extent) that are of primary interest; and decision 
support systems where informatics allow stakeholders to custom-make impact-relevant thresholds and then 
query databases to understand current and future characteristics (Bachmair et al., 2016; Buontempo et al., 
2020). However, users also ask for capacity building activities related to basic knowledge in climate change 
sciences and climate-related risks (De Bruin et al., 2020; Sultan et al., 2020).   
 
Since AR5 and SROCC (Chapter 2) there has been considerable progress in understanding climate 
information user needs (Baztan et al., 2017; Golding et al., 2017b, 2017a, 2019; Bruno Soares et al., 2018a; 
Hewitt and Golding, 2018; Singh et al., 2018; Sivakumar and Lucio, 2018; Bessembinder et al., 2019; Sultan 
et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020b; Hewitt et al., 2020b), better facilitation of user engagement (Buontempo et 
al., 2014, 2018; Buontempo and Hewitt, 2018) and an appreciation of climate scientists to involve 
communication specialists and social scientists to support the co-design and co-development process that is 
fundamental to a successful climate service (Buontempo et al., 2014; Gregow et al., 2016; Damm et al., 
2019).  
 
Climate services require user engagement and can take various forms in which climate information and data 
is delivered or communicated to the users (very high confidence). Different levels of user engagement exist, 
which can range from passive engagement, interactive group activities, to focused relationships between 
climate service provider and users, and which result in different types of climate service products including 
websites, capacity building, and co-design of tailored climate indices (Hewitt et al., 2017b) (see Cross-
Chapter Box 12.2, Figure 1). The fundamental basis for climate service development is the co-production 
process between climate services provider and user (Valiela, 2006; Briley et al., 2015; Golding et al., 2017a; 
Vincent et al., 2018a; Bruno Soares and Buontempo, 2019; Schipper et al., 2019), which can be very 
resource intensive (Buontempo et al., 2018; Falloon et al., 2018; Kolstad et al., 2019) and varies strongly 
from case to case (Reinecke, 2015; Bremer et al., 2019; Goodess et al., 2019; Jung and Schindler, 2019). 
Climate services scholars and practitioners can better facilitate and embrace the knowledge co-production 
process if it is recognized as a multi-faceted phenomenon with several dimensions (e.g., constitutive, 
interactional, institutional, pedagogical, empowerment) (Kruk et al., 2017; Knaggård et al., 2019; 
Weichselgartner and Arheimer, 2019).  
 
Information moves from useful to usable only when users effectively incorporate this information into a 
decision process (Lemos et al., 2012; Bruno Soares and Dessai, 2016; Prokopy et al., 2017) (see also WGII, 
Chapter 17). Climate services include a range of knowledge brokerage activities such as: identify knowledge 
needs; dissemination of knowledge; coordinate and network; compile and translate; build capacity through 
informed decision-making; analyse, evaluate and develop policy; and personal consultation (e.g., (De Bruin 
et al., 2020). When analysing four European climate services, (Reinecke, 2015) found that different climate 
services emphasized different knowledge brokerage activities. 
 
There are various types of providers and products of climate services related to the key sectors and regions 
such as those described in previous sections (Hewitt et al., 2017a). For instance, studies have described 
sectoral climate services in support of agriculture (Falloon et al., 2018; Hansen et al., 2019), health (Jancloes 
et al., 2014; Lowe et al., 2017), tourism (Morin et al., 2018; Damm et al., 2019; Matthews et al., 2020),  
energy (Troccoli, 2018b; Goodess et al., 2019; Soret et al., 2019), disaster risk reduction (Golding et al., 
2019; Street et al., 2019), water (van den Hurk et al., 2016; Vano et al., 2018), ocean and coastal ecosystems 
(Weisse et al., 2015; Le Cozannet et al., 2017), cities (Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2014; Rosenzweig et al., 
2015; Gidhagen et al., 2020), and cultural heritage (ICOMOS, 2019). Many countries (including almost 
every country in Europe – see Atlas.5.6.3.4) have established a climate service centre, which follow different 
practices of user engagement and provide different products (e.g., Kjellström et al., 2016; Kolstad, 2019; 
Skelton et al., 2017). Climate services in other countries may be distributed across agencies and programs, 
although these are often not centrally coordinated (Parris et al., 2016). One of the key pillars of the GFCS is 
the Climate Services Information System (CSIS), which is the principal mechanism through which 
information about past, present and future climate is archived, analysed, modelled, exchanged and processed 
for users (Hewitt et al., 2020a). Some national governments also have organized national climate projections 
to be used for official planning (e.g.,(EEA, 2018). A list of available national products (e.g., observational 
datasets) and projections can be found in the Atlas (e.g., Section Atlas.1.1.3 and 2.3). 
 
Figure 12.12 maps a general categorization of practices and products that have emerged from reviewing the 
climate service literature and user interviews (Visscher et al., 2020). The categories range from very generic 
products or expert analysis focused particularly on climate information (climate-centric approaches) to more 
integrated products that include shared open-source products and capacity building as well as tailored 
products that treat climate information as part of a larger decision-making context (climate-inclusive 
approaches). Three specific examples that elaborate in more detail on specific practices and products related 
to those general categories are provided in the Cross-chapter box 12.2.

## 12.6.3  Challenges  
 
Climate services set new scientific challenges to physical climate research (high confidence). Over at least 
the last decade, for instance, many questions have appeared in terms of optimal estimation of changes and 
uncertainties from projections of model ensembles, ensemble optimization, or adjustment of model biases 
while preserving essential information on trends and cross-variable, time and space consistencies, 
downscaling information at the local scale (Benestad et al., 2017; Hewitt et al., 2017a; Marotzke et al., 2017; 
Hewitt and Lowe, 2018; Knutti, 2019) (see also Section 10.5). Other challenges related to climate services 
are the inter-operability of data (Giuliani et al., 2017), access to data (open/FAIR Guiding principles 
(Wilkinson et al., 2016; Georgeson et al., 2017)), format of data (including moving away from percentile-
based probabilistic forecasts (e.g., Haines, 2019) and funding mechanisms (Bruno Soares and Buontempo, 
2019).  
 
Understanding and modeling of weather and climate extremes is of great relevance for climate services and 
is continuing to set challenges for research, such as modeling changes in impact-relevant threshold 
exceedance and return periods for a variety of extremes (Maraun et al., 2015; Sillmann et al., 2017; Hewitt et 
al., 2020c; Schwingshackl et al., 2021) (see also Chapter 11). Extreme event attribution has also been used in 
context of climate services (Philip et al., 2020) as it is of interest to some stakeholder groups (Sippel et al., 
2015; Marjanac and Patton, 2018; Jézéquel et al., 2019, 2020). The usefulness or applicability of available 
extreme event attribution methods (see Cross-chapter box 1.4 and section 11.2.4) for assessing climate-
related risks remains subject to debate (Shepherd, 2016; Mann et al., 2017; Lloyd and Oreskes, 2018).  
 
The design of climate services involves key challenges, such as a domain challenge where users, tasks and 
data may be unknown; and an informational challenge related to the use and adoption of novel and complex 
scientific data (Christel et al., 2018). This includes challenges in the uptake of climate information in terms 
of coordinated delivery of data, information, expertise and training by public research institutes, the 
inclusion of climate change adaptation in public and private regulation, and uncertainties and confidence in 
climate projections (Cavelier et al., 2017). Quality control and quality assurance are still weak elements in 
the development of climate service products (Jacob, 2020). Quality criteria or standards (that go beyond 
good practice) will have to be developed and agreed (cf. (Pacchetti et al., 2021). These challenges reflect the 
dilemma that exists at the interface between the climate modelling community and climate services 
regarding: 1) the purposes of the models for climate research versus service development; 2) the gap between 
the spatial and temporal scales of the models versus the scales needed in applications; and 3) tailoring 
climate model results to real-world applications (Benestad et al., 2017; Hackenbruch et al., 2017; van den 
Hurk et al., 2018).  
 
Climate services require a sustained engagement between scientists, service providers and users that is often 
hindered by limited resources for the co-design and co-production process (high confidence). There are 
recurring challenges related to successful climate service applications: 1) climate services are not visible and 
poorly understood by ‘end users’ (Weichselgartner and Arheimer, 2019); 2) data can be of unknown or poor 
quality, data formats can be hard to access or process, and it can be difficult to choose from large databases 
(e.g. Section 1.5.4) without appropriate user guidance; 3) users are unsure how to choose from available 
climate services to meet their needs (Rössler et al., 2019); 4) building trust between climate service users and 
providers (Baztan et al., 2020); 5) the lack of understanding of users and their contexts by the climate science 
and service community (Porter and Dessai, 2017); 6) the difficulty in scaling up services (Tall et al., 2014; 
van Huysen et al., 2018); 7) the lack of trained scientists skilled at conducting societally-relevant research 
(Rozance et al., 2020).   
 
Challenges also arise in determining the effectiveness and added value of climate services, particularly in 
terms of providing quantitative estimates of economic benefits and making a business case for climate 
services (Bruno Soares, 2017). The market for climate services is still in its infancy (Cavelier et al., 2017; 
Bruno Soares et al., 2018b; Tall et al., 2018; Damm et al., 2019). One form of value may be determined by a 
particular user community’s willingness to pay (Acquah and Onumah, 2011; Ouédraogo et al., 2018; Antwi-
Agyei et al., 2021), which however cannot reflect the value of climate services as a public good and for 
society as a whole (Hewitt et al., 2012). Literature is only recently emerging on the socio-economic benefits 
of weather and climate services (Vaughan et al., 2019). Early studies and guidelines from the WMO focus on 
cost-benefit ratios (Perrels et al., 2013; WMO, 2015). Issues related to demand-driven versus supply-driven 
climate services (Lourenço et al., 2016; Street, 2016; Daniels et al., 2020), public versus private climate 
services (Hewitt et al., 2020a) and business models for climate services (Hoa, 2018) have been raised. A 
large share of climate services documented in peer-reviewed literature is currently provided in non-market 
frameworks (e.g., public service obligations and R&D grants) (Hoa, 2018; Kolstad et al., 2019; Cortekar et 
al., 2020).  
 
Other challenges related to governance and dealing with complex systems are sometimes acknowledged but 
less well described in the climate services domain (Hewitt et al., 2020a). Importantly, decision contexts are 
strongly rooted in past practice (which often does not even make optimal use of past climate information), 
stakeholder experience and history. Even important emerging concepts of co-production, entry points, and 
champions do not always fall naturally into these realities without significant effort. The social sciences have 
an important role in helping understand and tackle these challenges (Bruno Soares and Buontempo, 2019).

# <goto>12.7</goto>  Final Remarks 
 
The assessment in this chapter is based on a rapidly growing body of new evidence from the peer-reviewed 
literature, direct calculations of climate projections from several new model ensembles, and results from 
other AR6 WGI chapters. Although a large amount a new information on CID changes and their uptake in 
climate services has become available since AR5, some challenges still remain. This section summarizes 
some of these main challenges, with a view to facilitating improved assessments in future. The section is 
organized following the order of chapter sections and consolidated according to key assessment components.  
- The adoption of the climatic impact-driver (CID) framework could benefit more from stronger 
connections across physical climate and impact scientists, and between the science community and 
practitioners/stakeholders on the ground. Co-development of CID index definitions with impact 
scientists or stakeholders helps ensure their salience and utility {12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.6}. 

- The ability to project all aspects of shifting CID profiles and their effects at fine, local scales is often 
reliant on dynamical downscaling and additional impact modelling steps, making a robust and full 
quantification of the uncertainties involved more challenging. Availability of multiple models and 
ease of connecting physical climate models at different scales can facilitate assessment {12.2, 12.3, 
12.4, 12.5}. 

- Regional and sub-regional differences in coverage and access of homogeneous historical records, in 
the deployment of regional model ensembles and the exploration of scenarios, and ultimately in 
peer-reviewed studies addressing the full range of past and current behavior, detection and 
attribution, and future projections challenge a uniformly robust assessment across all CIDs and 
regions of the world {12.4, 12.5}. 

- Efforts to assess a consistent global, large scale view of CID changes across regions and sectors 
would benefit from additional coordinated studies adopting common CID indices, model protocols, 
time horizons and scenarios or global warming levels {12.3, 12.5}. 
 
- Even though the body of peer-reviewed literature regarding climate services practices and products 
is growing, a large part is still documented only in grey literature arising from commercial 
consultancy, and thus not publicly and freely accessible {12.6}.
