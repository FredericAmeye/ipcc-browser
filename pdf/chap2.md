# 2.es Executive Summary  
 
Chapter 2 assesses observed large-scale changes in climate system drivers, key climate indicators and 
principal modes of variability. Chapter 3 considers model performance and detection/attribution, and Chapter 
4 covers projections for a subset of these same indicators and modes of variability. Collectively, these 
chapters provide the basis for later chapters, which focus upon processes and regional changes. Within 
Chapter 2, changes are assessed from in situ and remotely sensed data and products and from indirect 
evidence of longer-term changes based upon a diverse range of climate proxies. The time-evolving 
availability of observations and proxy information dictate the periods that can be assessed. Wherever 
possible, recent changes are assessed for their significance in a longer-term context, including target proxy 
periods, both in terms of mean state and rates of change. 
 
## Changes in Climate System Drivers 
 
Climate system drivers lead to climate change by altering the Earth’s energy balance. The influence of a 
climate driver is described in terms of its effective radiative forcing (ERF), measured in W⋅m<sup>–2</sup>. Positive ERF 
values exert a warming influence and negative ERF values exert a cooling influence (Chapter 7). 
 
*Present-day global concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) are at higher levels than at 
any time in at least the past two million years (high confidence). Changes in ERF since the late 19th 
century are dominated by increases in concentrations of greenhouse gases and trends in aerosols; the 
net ERF is positive and changing at an increasing rate since the 1970s (medium confidence).* {2.2, 7.2, 
7.3}
 
*Change in ERF from natural factors since 1750 is negligible in comparison to anthropogenic drivers 
(very high confidence).* Solar activity since 1900 was high but not exceptional compared to the past 9000 
years (high confidence). The average magnitude and variability of volcanic aerosol forcing since 1900 have 
not been unusual compared to the past 2500 years (medium confidence). {2.2.1, 2.2.2} 
 
*In 2019, concentrations of CO₂, methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) reached levels of 409.9 (±0.4) 
ppm, 1866.3 (±3.3) ppb and 332.1 (±0.4) ppb, respectively. Since 1850, these well-mixed greenhouse 
gases (GHGs) have increased at rates that have no precedent on centennial time scales in at least the 
past 800,000 years.* Concentrations of CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O increased from 1750 to 2019 by 131.6 ± 2.9 ppm 
(47.3%), 1137 ± 10 ppb (156%), and 62 ± 6 ppb (23.0%) respectively. These changes are larger than those 
between glacial and interglacial periods over the last 800,000 years for CO₂ and CH₄ and of comparable 
magnitude for N₂O (very high confidence). The best estimate of the total ERF from CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O in 
2019 relative to 1750 is 2.9 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup>, an increase of 12.5 % from 2011. ERF from halogenated components in 
2019 was 0.4 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup>, an increase of 3.5% since 2011. {2.2.3, 2.2.4, 7.3.2} 
 
*Tropospheric aerosol concentrations across the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes increased from 
1700 to the last quarter of the 20th century, but have subsequently declined (high confidence).* Aerosol 
optical depth (AOD) has decreased since 2000 over Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes and Southern 
Hemisphere mid-latitude continents, but increased over South Asia and East Africa (high confidence). These 
trends are even more pronounced in AOD from sub-micrometre aerosols for which the anthropogenic 
contribution is particularly large. The best-estimate of aerosol ERF in 2019 relative to 1750 is –1.1 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup>. 
{2.2.6, 7.3.3} 
 
*Changes in other short-lived gases are associated with an overall positive ERF (medium confidence).* 
Stratospheric ozone has declined between 60˚S and 60˚N by 2.2% from the 1980s to 2014–2017 (high 
confidence). Since the mid-20th century, tropospheric ozone has increased by 30–70% across the Northern 
Hemisphere (medium confidence). Since the mid-1990s, free tropospheric ozone increases were 2–7% per 
decade in the northern mid-latitudes (high confidence), 2–12% per decade in the tropics (high confidence) 
and <5% per decade in southern mid-latitudes (medium confidence). The best estimate of ozone column ERF 
(0.5 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup>relative to 1750) is dominated by changes in tropospheric ozone. Due to discrepancies in satellite 
and in situ records, there is low confidence in estimates of stratospheric water vapour change. {2.2.5, 7.3.2} 

*Biophysical effects from historical changes in land use have an overall negative ERF (medium 
confidence).* The best-estimate ERF from the increase in global albedo is –0.15 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup>since 1700 and –0.12 
W⋅m<sup>–2</sup>since 1850 (medium confidence). {2.2.7, 7.3.4} 
 
## Changes in Key Indicators of Global Climate Change 
 
*Observed changes in the atmosphere, oceans, cryosphere and biosphere provide unequivocal evidence 
of a world that has warmed. Over the past several decades, key indicators of the climate system are 
increasingly at levels unseen in centuries to millennia, and are changing at rates unprecedented in at 
least the last 2000 years (high confidence)*. In the last decade, global mean surface temperature (GMST) 
was more likely than not higher than for any multi-century average during the Holocene (past 11,700 years) 
and was comparable to temperatures of the Last Interglacial period (roughly 125,000 years ago). {2.3} 
 
*GMST increased by 0.85 [0.69 to 0.95] °C between 1850–1900 and 1995–2014 and by 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20] 
°C between 1850–1900 and 2011–2020. From 1850–1900 to 2011–2020, the temperature increase over 
land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83] °C) has been faster than over the oceans (0.88 [0.68 to 1.01] °C).* Over the last 
50 years, observed GMST has increased at a rate unprecedented in at least the last 2000 years (medium 
confidence). The increase in GMST since the mid-19th century was preceded by a slow decrease that began 
in the mid-Holocene (around 6500 years ago) (medium confidence). {2.3.1.1, Cross-Chapter Box 2.1} 
 
*Changes in GMST and global surface air temperature (GSAT) over time differ by at most 10% in 
either direction (high confidence), and the long-term changes in GMST and GSAT are presently 
assessed to be identical.* There is expanded uncertainty in GSAT estimates, with the assessed change from 
1850–1900 to 1995–2014 being 0.85 [0.67 to 0.98] °C. {Cross-Chapter box 2.3} 
 
*The troposphere has warmed since at least the 1950s, and it is virtually certain that the stratosphere 
has cooled.* In the Tropics, the upper troposphere has warmed faster than the near-surface since at least 2001, 
the period over which new observation techniques permit more robust quantification (medium confidence). It 
is virtually certain that the tropopause height has risen globally over 1980–2018, but there is low confidence 
in the magnitude. {2.3.1.2} 
 
*Changes in several components of the global hydrological cycle provide evidence for overall 
strengthening since at least 1980 (high confidence). However, there is low confidence in comparing 
recent changes with past variations due to limitations in paleoclimate records at continental and global 
scales.* Global land precipitation has likely increased since 1950, with a faster increase since the 1980s 
(medium confidence). Near-surface specific humidity has increased over both land (very likely) and the 
oceans (likely) since at least the 1970s. Relative humidity has very likely decreased over land areas since 
2000. Global total column water vapour content has very likely increased during the satellite era. 
Observational uncertainty leads to low confidence in global trends in precipitation minus evaporation and 
river runoff. {2.3.1.3} 
 
*Several aspects of the large-scale atmospheric circulation have likely changed since the mid-20th 
century, but limited proxy evidence yields low confidence in how these changes compare to longer-
term climate.* The Hadley circulation has very likely widened since at least the 1980s, and extratropical 
storm tracks have likely shifted poleward in both hemispheres. Global monsoon precipitation has likely 
increased since the 1980s, mainly in the Northern Hemisphere (medium confidence). Since the 1970s, near-
surface winds have likely weakened over land. Over the oceans, near-surface winds likely strengthened over 
1980–2000, but divergent estimates lead to low confidence in the sign of change thereafter. It is likely that 
the northern stratospheric polar vortex has weakened since the 1980s and experienced more frequent 
excursions toward Eurasia. {2.3.1.4} 
 
*Current Arctic sea ice coverage levels are the lowest since at least 1850 for both annual mean and late-
summer values (high confidence) and for the past 1000 years for late-summer values (medium 
confidence).* Between 1979 and 2019, Arctic sea ice area has decreased in both summer and winter, with sea 
ice becoming younger, thinner and more dynamic (very high confidence). Decadal means for Arctic sea ice 
area decreased from 6.23 million km2 in 1979–1988 to 3.76 million km2 in 2010–2019 for September and 
from 14.52 to 13.42 million km2 for March. Antarctic sea ice area has experienced little net change since 
1979 (high confidence), with only minor differences between sea ice area decadal means for 1979–1988 
(2.04 million km2 for February, 15.39 million km2 for September) and 2010–2019 (2.17 million km2 for 
February, 15.75 million km2 for September). {2.3.2.1} 
 
*Changes across the terrestrial cryosphere are widespread, with several indicators now in states 
unprecedented in centuries to millennia (high confidence).* Reductions in spring snow cover extent have 
occurred across the Northern Hemisphere since at least 1978 (very high confidence). With few exceptions, 
glaciers have retreated since the second half of the 19th century and continued to retreat with increased rates 
since the 1990s (very high confidence); this behaviour is unprecedented in at least the last 2000 years 
(medium confidence). Greenland Ice Sheet mass loss has increased substantially since 2000 (high 
confidence). The Greenland Ice Sheet was smaller than at present during the Last Interglacial period (high 
confidence) and the mid-Holocene (high confidence). The Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) lost mass between 1992 
and 2020 (very high confidence), with an increasing rate of mass loss over this period (medium confidence). 
Although permafrost persists in areas of the Northern Hemisphere where it was absent prior to 3000 years 
ago, increases in temperatures in the upper 30 m over the past three to four decades have been widespread 
(high confidence). {2.3.2} 
 
*Global mean sea level (GMSL) is rising, and the rate of GMSL rise since the 20th century is faster 
than over any preceding century in at least the last three millennia (high confidence). Since 1901, 
GMSL has risen by 0.20 [0.15–0.25] m, and the rate of rise is accelerating.* Further back in time, there is 
medium confidence that GMSL was within –3.5 to 0.5 m (very likely) of present during the mid-Holocene 
(6000 years ago), 5 to 10 m (likely) higher during the Last Interglacial (125,000 years ago), and 5 to 25 m 
(very likely) higher during the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (MPWP) (3.3 million years ago). {2.3.3.3} 
 
*Recent ocean changes are widespread, and key ocean indicators are in states unprecedented for 
centuries to millennia (high confidence).* Since 1971, it is virtually certain that global ocean heat content 
has increased for the upper (0–700 m) layer, very likely for the intermediate (700–2000 m) layer and likely 
below 2000 m, and is currently increasing faster than at any point since at least the last deglacial transition 
(18-11 thousand years ago) (medium confidence). It is virtually certain that large-scale near-surface salinity 
contrasts have intensified since at least 1950. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) was 
relatively stable during the past 8000 years (medium confidence) but declined during the 20th century (low 
confidence). Ocean pH has declined globally at the surface over the past four decades (virtually certain) and 
in all ocean basins in the ocean interior (high confidence) over the past 2–3 decades. Deoxygenation  has 
occurred in most open ocean regions during the mid 20th to early 21st centuries (high confidence), with 
decadal variability (medium confidence). Oxygen minimum zones are expanding at many locations (high 
confidence). {2.3.3} 
 
*Changes in the marine biosphere are consistent with large-scale warming and changes in ocean 
geochemistry (high confidence).* The ranges of many marine organisms are shifting towards the poles and 
towards greater depths (high confidence), but a minority of organisms are shifting in the opposite directions. 
This mismatch in responses across species means that the species composition of ecosystems is changing 
(medium confidence). At multiple locations, various phenological metrics for marine organisms have 
changed in the last 50 years, with the nature of the changes varying with location and with species (high 
confidence). In the last two decades, the concentration of phytoplankton at the base of the marine food web, 
as indexed by chlorophyll concentration, has shown weak and variable trends in low and mid-latitudes and 
an increase in high latitudes (medium confidence). Global marine primary production decreased slightly from 
1998–2018, with increasing production in the Arctic (medium confidence). {2.3.4.2} 
 
*Changes in key global aspects of the terrestrial biosphere are consistent with large-scale warming 
(high confidence).* Over the last century, there have been poleward and upslope shifts in the distributions of 
many land species (very high confidence) as well as increases in species turnover within many ecosystems 
(high confidence). Over the past half century, climate zones have shifted poleward, accompanied by an 
increase in the length of the growing season in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics and an increase in the 
amplitude of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO₂ above 45°N (high confidence). Since the early 1980s, 
there has been a global-scale increase in the greenness of the terrestrial surface (high confidence). {2.3.4.1, 
2.3.4.3} 
 
*During the Mid-Pliocene warm period (MPWP, 3.3–3.0 million years ago) slowly changing large-scale 
indicators reflect a world that was warmer than present, with CO₂ similar to current levels.* CO₂ levels 
during the MPWP were similar to present for a sustained period, within a range of 360–420 ppm (medium 
confidence). Relative to the present, GMST, GMSL and precipitation rate were all higher, the Northern 
Hemisphere latitudinal temperature gradient was lower, and major terrestrial biomes were shifted northward 
(very high confidence). There is high confidence that cryospheric indicators were diminished and medium 
confidence that the Pacific longitudinal temperature gradient weakened and monsoon systems strengthened. 
{2.3, Cross-Chapter Box 2.4, 9.6.2} 
 
*Inferences from past climate states based on proxy records can be compared with climate projections 
over coming centuries to place the range of possible futures into a longer-term context.* There is 
medium confidence in the following mappings between selected paleo periods and future projections: During 
the Last Interglacial, GMST is estimated to have been 0.5°C–1.5°C warmer than the 1850–1900 reference 
for a sustained period, which overlaps the low end of the range of warming projected under SSP1-2.6, 
including its negative-emissions extension to the end of the 23rd century [1.0–2.2] °C. During the mid-
Pliocene Warm Period, the GMST estimate [2.5-4.0] °C is similar to the range projected under SSP2-4.5 for 
the end of the 23rd century [2.3-4.6] °C. GMST estimates for the Miocene Climatic Optimum [5–10] °C and 
Early Eocene Climatic Optimum [10–18] °C, about 15 and 50 million years ago, respectively, overlap with 
the range projected for the end of the 23rd century under SSP5-8.5 [6.6–14.1] °C. {Cross-Chapter Box 2.1, 
2.3.1, 4.3.1.1, 4.7.1.1} 
 
## Changes in Modes of Variability 
 
Since the late 19th century, major modes of climate variability show no sustained trends but do exhibit 
fluctuations in frequency and magnitude at inter-decadal time scales, with the notable exception of the 
Southern Annular Mode, which has become systematically more positive (high confidence). There is 
high confidence that these modes of variability have existed for millennia or longer, but low confidence 
in detailed reconstructions of most modes prior to direct instrumental records. Both polar annular 
modes have exhibited strong positive trends toward increased zonality of midlatitude circulation over multi-
decadal periods, but these trends have not been sustained for the Northern Annular Mode since the early 
1990s (high confidence). For tropical ocean modes, a sustained shift beyond multi-centennial variability has 
not been observed for El Niño–Southern Oscillation (medium confidence), but there is low evidence and low 
agreement about the long-term behaviour of other tropical ocean modes. Modes of decadal and multi-
decadal variability over the Pacific and Atlantic oceans exhibit no significant trends over the period of 
observational records (high confidence). {2.4} 

# 2.1 Introduction 
 
This chapter assesses the evidence-basis for large-scale past changes in selected components of the climate 
system. As such, it combines much of the assessment performed in Chapters 2 through 5 of the Fifth 
Assessment Report (AR5) WGI contribution (IPCC, 2013) that, taken together, supported a finding of 
unequivocal recent warming of the climate system. The Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) WGI Report 
structure differs substantially from that in AR5 (Section 1.1.2). The current chapter focuses upon observed 
changes in climate system drivers and changes in key selected large-scale indicators of climate change and in 
important modes of variability (Cross-Chapter Box 2.2), which allow for an assessment of changes in the 
global climate system in an integrated manner. This chapter is complemented by Chapters 3 and 4, which 
respectively consider model assessment / detection and attribution, and future climate projections for subsets 
of these same indicators and modes. It does not consider changes in observed extremes, which are assessed 
in Chapter 11. The chapter structure is outlined in the visual abstract (Figure 2.1).  
 
<figref>2.1</figref> 
 
Use is made of paleoclimate, in situ, ground- and satellite-based remote sensing, and reanalysis data products 
where applicable (Section 1.5). All observational products used in the chapter are detailed in Annex I, and 
information on data sources and processing for each figure and table can be found in the associated chapter 
table 2.SM.1 available as an electronic supplement to the chapter. Use of common periods ranging from 56 
million years ago through to the recent past is applied to the extent permitted by available data (Section 1.4.1 
and Cross-Chapter Box 2.1). In all cases, the narrative proceeds from as far in the past as the data permit 
through to the present. Each sub-section starts by highlighting the key findings from AR5 and any relevant 
AR6-cycle special reports (SROCC, SR1.5, SRCCL), and then outlines the new evidence-basis arising from 
a combination of: i) new findings reported in the literature, including new datasets and new versions of 
existing datasets; and ii) recently observed changes, before closing with a new summary assessment.  
 
Trends, when calculated as part of this assessment, have wherever possible been calculated using a common 
approach following that adopted in Box 2.2 of Chapter 2 of AR5 (Hartmann et al., 2013). In addition to 
trends, consideration is also made of changes between various time slices / periods in performing the 
assessment (Section 1.4.1 and Cross-Chapter Box 2.1). Statistical significance of trends and changes are 
assessed at the two-tailed 90% confidence (very likely) level unless otherwise stated. Limited use is also 
made of published analyses that have employed a range of methodological choices. In each such case the 
method / metric is stated. 
 
There exist a variety of inevitable and, in some cases, irreducible uncertainties in performing an assessment 
of the observational evidence for climate change. In some instances, a combination of sources of uncertainty 
is important. For example, the assessment of global surface temperature over the instrumental record in 
Section 2.3.1.1.3 considers a combination of observational-dataset and trend-estimate uncertainties. 
Furthermore, estimates of parametric uncertainty are often not comprehensive in their consideration of all 
possible factors and, when such estimates are constructed in distinct manners, there are often significant 
limitations to their direct comparability (Hartmann et al., 2013; their Box 2.1).

## 2.2  Changes in Climate Drivers 
 
This section assesses the magnitude and rates of changes in both natural and anthropogenically mediated 
climate drivers over a range of time scales. First, changes in insolation (orbital and solar; 2.2.1), and volcanic 
stratospheric aerosol (2.2.2) are assessed. Next, well-mixed greenhouse gases (GHGs) (CO₂, N₂O and CH₄) 
are covered in 2.2.3, with climate feedbacks and other processes involved in the carbon cycle assessed in 
Chapter 5. The section continues with the assessment of changes in halogenated GHGs (2.2.4), stratospheric 
water vapour, stratospheric and tropospheric ozone (2.2.5), and tropospheric aerosols (2.2.6). Short-lived 
Climate Forcers (SLCFs), their precursor emissions and key processes are assessed in more detail in Chapter 6.
Section 2.2.7 assesses the effect of historical land cover change on climate, including biophysical and 
biogeochemical processes. Section 2.2.8 summarizes the changes in the Earth’s energy balance since 1750 
using the comprehensive assessment of Effective Radiative Forcing (ERF) performed in Section 7.3. For 
some SLCFs with insufficient spatial or temporal observational coverage, ERFs are based on model 
estimates, but also reported here for completeness and context. Tabulated global mixing ratios of all well-
mixed GHGs and ERFs from 1750–2019 are provided in Annex III. 
 
 
## 2.2.1  Solar and Orbital Forcing 
 
AR5 assessed solar variability over multiple time scales, concluding that total solar irradiance (TSI) multi-
millennial fluctuations over the past 9 kyr were <1 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup>, but with no assessment of confidence provided. 
For multi-decadal to centennial variability over the last millennium, AR5 emphasized reconstructions of TSI 
that show little change (<0.1%) since the Maunder Minimum (1645–1715) when solar activity was 
particularly low, again without providing a confidence level. AR5 further concluded that the best estimate of 
radiative forcing due to TSI changes for the period 1750–2011 was 0.05–0.10 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> (medium confidence), 
and that TSI very likely changed by –0.04 [–0.08–0.00 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup>] between 1986 and 2008. Potential solar 
influences on climate due to feedbacks arising from interactions with Galactic Cosmic Rays are assessed in 
Section 7.3.4.5.  
 
Slow periodic changes in the Earth’s orbit around the Sun mainly cause variations in seasonal and latitudinal 
receipt of incoming solar radiation. Precise calculations of orbital variations are available for tens of millions 
of years (Berger and Loutre, 1991; Laskar et al., 2011). The range of insolation averaged over boreal 
summer at 65°N was about 83 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> during the past million years, and 3.2 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> during the past 
millennium, but there was no substantial effect upon global average radiative forcing (0.02 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> during the 
past millennium). 
 
A new reconstruction of solar irradiance extends back 9 kyr based upon updated cosmogenic isotope datasets 
and improved models for production and deposition of cosmogenic nuclides (Poluianov et al., 2016), and 
shows that solar activity during the second half of the 20th century was in the upper decile of the range. TSI 
features millennial-scale changes with typical magnitudes of 1.5 [1.4 to 2.1] W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> (Wu et al., 2018). 
Although stronger variations in the deeper past cannot be ruled out completely (Egorova, T. et al., 2018; 
Reinhold et al., 2019), there is no indication of such changes having happened over the last 9 kyr. 
 
Recent estimates of TSI and spectral solar irradiance (SSI) for the past millennium are based upon updated 
irradiance models (e.g., Egorova et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018) and employ updated and revised direct sunspot 
observations over the last three centuries (Clette et al., 2014; Chatzistergos et al., 2017) as well as records of 
sunspot numbers reconstructed from cosmogenic isotope data prior to this (Usoskin et al., 2016). These 
reconstructed TSI timeseries (Figure 2.2a) feature little variation in TSI averaged over the past millennium. 
The TSI between the Maunder Minimum (1645–1715) and second half of the 20th century increased by 0.7–
2.7 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> (Jungclaus et al., 2017; Egorova et al., 2018; Lean, 2018; Wu, C.-J. et al., 2018; Yeo et al., 2020; 
Lockwood & Ball, 2020). This TSI increase implies a change in ERF of 0.09–0.35 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> (Section 7.3.4.4). 
 
Estimation of TSI changes since 1900 (Figure 2.2b) has further strengthened, and confirms a small (less than 
about 0.1 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup>) contribution to global climate forcing (Section 7.3.4.4). New reconstructions of TSI over 
the 20th century (Lean, 2018; Wu C-J. et al., 2018) support previous results that the TSI averaged over the 
solar cycle very likely increased during the first seven decades of the 20th century and decreased thereafter 
(Figure 2.2b). TSI did not change significantly between 1986 and 2019. Improved insights (Coddington et 
al., 2016; Yeo et al., 2015, 2017a; Krivova et al., 2006) show that variability in the 200–400 nm UV range 
was greater than previously assumed. Building on these results, the forcing proposed by Matthes et al. (2017) 
has a 16% stronger contribution to TSI variability in this wavelength range compared to the forcing used in 
the 5th Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). 
 
To conclude, solar activity since the late 19th century was relatively high but not exceptional in the context 
of the past 9 kyr (high confidence). The associated global-mean ERF is in the range of –0.06 to 0.08 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup>
 
(Section 7.3.4.4).

## 2.2.2  Volcanic Aerosol Forcing 
 
AR5 concluded that, on inter-annual time scales, the radiative effects of volcanic aerosols are a dominant 
natural driver of climate variability, with the greatest effects occurring within the first 2–5 years following a 
strong eruption. Reconstructions of radiative forcing by volcanic aerosols used in the Paleoclimate 
Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase III (PMIP3) simulations and in AR5 featured short-lived 
perturbations of a range of magnitudes, with events of greater magnitude than –1 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> (annual mean) 
occurring on average every 35–40 years, although no associated assessment of confidence was given. This 
section focuses on advances in reconstructions of stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD), whereas 
Chapter 7 focuses on the effective radiative forcing of volcanic aerosols, and Chapter 5 assesses volcanic 
emissions of CO₂ and CH₄; tropospheric aerosols are discussed in Section 2.2.6. Cross-Chapter Box 4.1 
undertakes an integrative assessment of volcanic effects including potential for 21st century effects. 
 
Advances in analysis of sulphate records from the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) and AIS have resulted in 
improved dating and completeness of SAOD reconstructions over the past 2.5 kyr (Sigl et al., 2015), a more 
uncertain extension back to 10 ka (Kobashi et al., 2017; Toohey and Sigl, 2017), and a better differentiation 
of sulphates that reach high latitudes via stratospheric (strong eruptions) versus tropospheric pathways 
(Burke et al., 2019; Gautier et al., 2019). The PMIP4 volcanic reconstruction extends the period analysed in 
AR5 by 1 kyr (Jungclaus et al., 2017; Figure 2.2c) and features multiple strong events that were previously 
misdated, underestimated or not detected, particularly before about 1500 CE. The period between successive 
large volcanic eruptions (Negative ERF greater than –1 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup>), ranges from 3–130 years, with an average of 
43 ± 7.5 years between such eruptions over the past 2.5 kyr (data from Toohey & Sigl, 2017). The most 
recent such eruption was that of Mt Pinatubo in 1991. Century-long periods that lack such large eruptions 
occurred once every 400 years on average. Systematic uncertainties related to the scaling of sulphate 
abundance in glacier ice to radiative forcing have been estimated to be about 60% (Hegerl et al., 2006). 
Uncertainty in the timing of eruptions in the proxy record is ± 2 years (95% confidence interval) back to 1.5 
ka and ± 4 years before (Toohey and Sigl, 2017). 
  
SAOD averaged over the period 950–1250 CE (0.012) was lower than for the period 1450–1850 CE (0.017) 
and similar to the period 1850–1900 (0.011). Uncertainties associated with these inter-period differences are 
not well quantified but have little effect because the uncertainties are mainly systematic throughout the 
record. Over the past 100 years, SAOD averaged 14% lower than the mean of the previous 24 centuries 
(back to 2.5 ka), and well within the range of centennial-scale variability (Toohey and Sigl, 2017). 
 
Direct observations of volcanic gas-phase sulphur emissions (mostly SO2), sulphate aerosols, and their 
radiative effects are available from a variety of sources (Kremser et al., 2016). New estimates of SO2 
emissions from explosive eruptions have been derived from satellite (beginning in 1979) and in situ 
measurements (Höpfner et al., 2015; Carn et al., 2016; Neely and Schmidt, 2016; Brühl, 2018). Satellite 
observations of aerosol extinction after recent eruptions have uncertainties of about 15–25% (Vernier et al., 
2011; Bourassa et al., 2012). Additional uncertainties occur when gaps in the satellite records are filled by 
complementary observations or using statistical methods (Thomason et al., 2018). Merged datasets 
(Thomason et al., 2018) and sparse ground-based measurements (Stothers, 1997) allow for volcanic forcing 
estimates back to 1850. In contrast to the CMIP5 historical volcanic forcing datasets (Ammann et al., 2003), 
updated time series (Luo et al., 2018; Figure 2.2d) feature a more comprehensive set of optical properties 
including latitude-, height- and wavelength-dependent aerosol extinction, single scattering albedo and 
asymmetry parameters. A series of small-to-moderate eruptions since 2000 resulted in perturbations in 
SAOD of 0.004–0.006 (Andersson et al., 2015; Schmidt et al., 2018). 
 
To conclude, strong individual volcanic eruptions cause multi-annual variations in radiative forcing. 
However, the average magnitude and variability of SAOD and its associated volcanic aerosol forcing since 
1900 are not unusual in the context of at least the past 2.5 kyr (medium confidence). 


## 2.2.3  Well-mixed Greenhouse Gases (WMGHGs) 
 
Well-mixed greenhouse gases generally have lifetimes of more than several years. AR5 assigned medium 
confidence to the values of atmospheric CO₂ concentrations (mixing ratios) during the warm geological 
periods of the early Eocene and Pliocene. It concluded with very high confidence that, by 2011, the mixing 
ratios of CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O in the atmosphere exceeded the range derived from ice cores for the previous 
800 kyr, and that the observed rates of increase of the greenhouse gases were unprecedented on centennial 
timescales over at least the past 22 kyr. It reported that over 2005–2011 atmospheric burdens of CO₂, CH₄, 
and N₂O increased, with 2011 levels of 390.5 ppm, 1803.2 ppb and 324.2 ppb, respectively. Increases of CO₂ 
and N₂O over 2005–2011 were comparable to those over 1996–2005, while CH₄ resumed increasing in 2007, 
after remaining nearly constant over 1999–2006. A comprehensive process-based assessment of changes in 
CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O is undertaken in Chapter 5. 
 
 
### 2.2.3.1  CO₂ during 450 Ma to 800 ka 
 
Isotopes from continental and marine sediments using improved analytical techniques and sampling 
resolution have reinforced the understanding of long-term changes in atmospheric CO₂ during the past 450 
Myr (Table 2.1, Figure 2.3). In particular, for the last 60 Myr, sampling resolution and accuracy of the boron 
isotope proxy in ocean sediments has improved (Anagnostou et al., 2016; 2020; Babila et al., 2018; Chalk et 
al., 2017; de la Vega et al., 2020; Dyez et al., 2018; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Harper et al., 2020; Henehan et al., 
2019; 2020; Penman et al., 2014; Raitzsch et al., 2018; Sosdian et al., 2018), the understanding of the 
alkenone CO₂ proxy has increased (e.g., Badger et al., 2019; Rae et al., 2021; Stoll et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 
2019; 2020) and new phytoplankton proxies have been developed and applied (e.g. Witkowski et al., 2018). 
Understanding of the boron isotope CO₂ proxy has improved since AR5 with studies showing very good 
agreement between boron-CO₂ estimates and co-existing ice core CO₂ (Chalk et al., 2017; Foster, 2008; 
Henehan et al., 2013; Hönisch & Hemming, 2005; Raitzsch et al., 2018; Figure 2.3c). Such independent 
validation has proven difficult to achieve with the other available CO₂ proxies (e.g. Badger et al., 2019; Da et 
al., 2019; Stoll et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019). Remaining uncertainties in these ocean sediment based 
proxies (Hollis et al., 2019) partly limit the applicability of the alkenone δ13C and boron δ11B proxies beyond 
the Cenozoic, although new records are emerging, e.g. Jurikova et al., (2020). CO₂ estimates from the 
terrestrial CO₂ proxies, such as stomatal density in fossil plants and δ13C of palaeosol carbonates, are 
available for much of the last 420 Myr. Given the low sampling density, relatively large CO₂ uncertainty, 
and high age uncertainty (relative to marine sediments) of the terrestrial proxies, preference here is given to 
the marine based proxies (and boron in particular) where possible.  
 
Levels were close to 1750 values during at least one prolonged interval during the Carboniferous and 
Permian (350–252 Ma). During the Triassic (251.9–201.3 Ma), atmospheric CO₂ mixing ratios reached a 
maximum between 2000–5000 ppm (200–220 Ma). During the PETM (56 Ma) CO₂ rapidly rose from about 
900 ppm to about 2000 ppm (Anagnostou et al., 2020; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Schubert & Jahren, 2013; Table 
2.1) in 3–20 kyr (Gutjahr et al., 2017; Turner, 2018; Zeebe et al., 2016). Estimated multi-millennial rates of 
CO₂ accumulation during this event range from 0.3–1.5 PgC yr<sup>–1</sup> (Gingerich, 2019); were at least 4-5 times 
lower than current centennial rates (Section 5.3.1.1). Based on boron and carbon isotope data, supported by 
other proxies (Hollis et al., 2019), atmospheric CO₂ during the EECO (50 Ma) was between 1150 and 2500 
ppm (medium confidence), and then gradually declined over the last 50 Myr at a long-term rate of about 16 
ppm Myr<sup>–1</sup> (Figure 2.3). The last time the CO₂ mixing ratio was as high as 1000 ppm (the level reached by 
some high emission scenarios by 2100; Annex III) was prior to the Eocene-Oligocene transition (33.5 Ma; 
Figure 2.3) that was associated with the first major advance of the AIS (Anagnostou et al., 2016; Hollis et al., 
2019; Pagani et al., 2011; Pearson et al., 2009; Witkowski et al., 2018). The compilation of Foster et al., 
(2017) constrained CO₂ concentration to between 290 and 450 ppm during the MPWP, based primarily on 
the boron-isotope data reported by Martínez-Botí et al. (2015b), consistent with the AR5 range of 300–450 
ppm. A more recent high-resolution boron isotope-based study revealed that CO₂ cycled during the MPWP 
from about 330 to about 390 ppm on orbital timescales, with a mean of about 370 ppm (de la Vega et al., 
2020). Although data from other proxy types (e.g., stomatal density or δ13C of alkenones) have too low 
resolution to resolve the orbital variability of CO₂ during this interval (e.g. Kürschner et al., 1996; Stoll et al., 
2019) there is general agreement among the different proxy types with the boron-derived mean (e.g. Stoll et 
al., 2019). High-resolution sampling (about 1 sample per 3 kyr) with the boron-isotope proxy indicates mean 
CO₂ mixing ratios for the Marine Isotope Stage KM5c interglacial were 360–420 ppm (medium confidence) 
(de la Vega et al., 2020).  
 
Following the MPWP, the atmospheric CO₂ mixing ratio generally decreased at a rate of about 30 ppm Myr<sup>–1</sup>. It is very likely that CO₂ levels as high as the present were not experienced in the last 2 Myr (Bartoli et al., 
2011; Chalk et al., 2017; Da et al., 2019; Dyez et al., 2018; Hönisch et al., 2009; Martínez-Botí et al., 2015a; 
Stoll et al., 2019). Related to the shift of glacial-interglacial cycle frequency from 40 to 100 kyr at 0.8–1.2 
Ma, there was a decrease of glacial-period CO₂ (Chalk et al., 2017; Dyez et al., 2018). These boron isotope-
based CO₂ results agree with available records based on ancient ice exposed near the surface of the AIS (Yan 
et al., 2019), however, direct comparison is limited due to a lack of ancient ice cores with sufficiently 
continuous stratigraphy (Higgins et al., 2015; Brook and Buizert, 2018). 
 
To conclude, there is high confidence that average EECO and MPWP (KM5c) CO₂ concentration was higher 
than those preceding industrialisation at 1150-2500 ppm and 360-420 ppm, respectively. Although there is 
some uncertainty due to the non-continuous nature of marine sediment records, the last time atmospheric 
CO₂ mixing ratio was as high as present was very likely more than 2 million years ago.

### 2.2.3.2  Glacial-interglacial WMGHG Fluctuations from 800 ka 
 
Since AR5, the number of ice cores for the last 800 kyr has increased and their temporal resolution has 
improved (Figure 2.4), especially for the last 60 kyr and when combined with analyses of firn air, leading to 
improved quantification of greenhouse gas concentrations prior to the mid-20th century. 
 
#### 2.2.3.2.1  CO₂ 

Records of CO₂ from the AIS formed during the last glacial period and the LDT show century-scale 
fluctuations of up to 9.6 ppm (Ahn et al., 2012; Ahn & Brook, 2014; Bauska et al., 2015; Marcott et al., 
2014; Rubino et al., 2019). Although these rates are an order of magnitude lower than those directly 
observed over 1919–2019 CE (Section 2.2.3.3.1), they provide information on non-linear responses of 
climate-biogeochemical feedbacks (Section 5.1.2). Multiple records for 0–1850 CE show CO₂ mixing ratios 
of 274–285 ppm. Offsets among ice core records are about 1%, but the long-term trends agree well and show 
coherent multi-centennial variations of about 10 ppm (Ahn et al., 2012; Bauska et al., 2015; Rubino et al., 
2019). Multiple records show CO₂ concentrations of 278.3 ± 2.9 ppm in 1750 and 285.5 ± 2.1 ppm in 1850 
(Ahn et al., 2012, 2019; Bauska et al., 2015; MacFarling Meure et al., 2006; Siegenthaler et al., 2005). CO₂ 
concentration increased by 5.0 ± 0.8 ppm during 970–1130 CE, followed by a decrease of 4.6 ± 1.7 ppm 
during 1580–1700 CE. The greatest rate of change over the CE prior to 1750 is observed at about 1600 CE, 
and ranges from –6.9 to 4.7 ppm per century in multiple high-resolution ice core records (Ahn et al., 2012; 
Bauska et al., 2015; MacFarling Meure et al., 2006; Rubino et al., 2019; Siegenthaler et al., 2005). Although 
ice core records present low-pass filtered time series due to gas diffusion and gradual bubble close-off in the 
snow layer over the ice sheet (Fourteau et al., 2020), the rate of increase since 1850 CE (about 125 ppm 
increase over about 170 years) is far greater than implied for any 170-year period by ice core records that 
cover the last 800 ka (very high confidence). 
 
 
#### 2.2.3.2.2  CH₄ 
CH₄ concentrations over the past 110 kyr are higher in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) than in the Southern 
Hemisphere (SH), but closely correlated on centennial and millennial timescales (WAIS Divide Project 
Members, 2015). On glacial to interglacial cycles, approximately 450 ppb oscillations in CH₄ concentrations 
have occurred (Loulergue et al., 2008). On millennial timescales, most rapid climate changes observed in 
Greenland and other regions are coincident with rapid CH₄ changes (Rhodes et al., 2015, 2017; WAIS 
Divide Project Members, 2015). The variability of CH₄ on centennial timescales during the early Holocene 
does not significantly differ from that of the late Holocene prior to about 1850 (Rhodes et al., 2013; Yang et 
al., 2017). The LGM concentration was 390.5 ± 6.0 ppb (Kageyama et al., 2017). The global mean 
concentrations during 0–1850 CE varied between 625 and 807 ppb. High-resolution ice core records from 
Antarctica and Greenland exhibit the same trends with an inter-polar difference of 36–47 ppb (Mitchell et al., 
2013b; Sapart et al., 2012). There is a long-term positive trend of about 0.5 ppb per decade during the 
Common Era (CE) until 1750 CE. The most rapid CH₄ changes prior to industrialisation were as large as 30–
50 ppb on multi-decadal timescales. Global mean CH₄ concentrations estimated from Antarctic and 
Greenland ice cores are 729.2 ± 9.4 ppb in 1750 and 807.6 ± 13.8 ppb in 1850 (Mitchell et al., 2013b). 
 
 
#### 2.2.3.2.3  N₂O 
New records show that N₂O concentration changes are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions (Schilt 
et al., 2014). The most rapid change during the last glacial termination is a 30 ppb increase in a 200-year 
period, which is an order of magnitude smaller than the modern rate (Section 2.2.3.3). During the LGM, N₂O 
was 208.5 ± 7.7  ppb (Kageyama et al., 2017). Over the Holocene the lowest value was 257 ± 6.6 ppb during 
6–8 ka, but millennial variation is not clearly detectable due to analytical uncertainty and insufficient ice 
core quality (Flückiger et al., 2002; Schilt et al., 2010). Recently acquired high-resolution records from 
Greenland and Antarctica for the last 2 kyr consistently show multi-centennial variations of about 5–10 ppb 
(Figure 2.4), although the magnitudes vary over time (Ryu et al., 2020). Three high temporal resolution 
records exhibit a short-term minimum at about 600 CE of 261 ± 4 ppb (MacFarling Meure et al., 2006; Ryu 
et al., 2020). It is very likely that industrial N₂O increase started before 1900 CE (Machida et al., 1995; 
Sowers, 2001; MacFarling Meure et al., 2006; Ryu et al., 2020). Multiple ice cores show N₂O concentrations 
of 270.1 ± 6.0 ppb in 1750 and 272.1 ± 5.7 ppb in 1850 (Flückiger et al., 1999; Machida et al., 1995; Rubino 
et al., 2019; Ryu et al., 2020; Sowers, 2001).

### 2.2.3.3  Modern measurements of WMGHGs 
 
In this section and for calculation of ERF, surface global averages are determined from measurements 
representative of the well-mixed lower troposphere. Global averages that include sites subject to significant 
anthropogenic activities or influenced by strong regional biospheric emissions are typically larger than those 
from remote sites, and require weighting accordingly (Table 2.2). This section focusses on global mean 
mixing ratios estimated from networks with global spatial coverage, and updated from the CMIP6 historical 
dataset (Meinshausen et al., 2017) for periods prior to the existence of global networks. 
 
<tableref>2.2</tableref>

#### 2.2.3.3.1  Carbon Dioxide (CO₂) 

There has been a positive trend in globally averaged surface CO₂ mixing ratios since 1958 (Figure 2.5a), that 
reflects the imbalance of sources and sinks (Section 5.2). The growth rate has increased overall since the 
1960s (Figure 2.5a inset), while annual growth rates have varied substantially, e.g. reaching a peak during 
the strong El Niño events of 1997–1998 and 2015–2016 (Bastos et al., 2013; Betts et al., 2016). The average 
annual CO₂ increase from 2000 through 2011 was 2.0 ppm yr<sup>–1</sup> (standard deviation 0.3 ppm yr<sup>–1</sup>), similar to 
what was reported in AR5. From 2011 through 2019 it was 2.4 ppm yr<sup>–1</sup> (standard deviation 0.5 ppm yr<sup>–1</sup>), 
which is higher than that of any comparable time period since global measurements began. Global networks 
consistently show that the globally averaged annual mean CO₂ has increased by 5.0% since 2011, reaching 
409.9 ± 0.4 ppm in 2019 (NOAA measurements). Further assessment of changing seasonality is undertaken 
in Section 2.3.4.1. 
 
<figref>2.5</figref> 
 
#### 2.2.3.3.2  Methane (CH₄) 
The globally averaged surface mixing ratio of CH₄ in 2019 was 1866.3 ± 3.3 ppb, which is 3.5% higher than 
2011, while observed increases from various networks range from 3.3–3.9% (Table 2.2; Figure 2.5b). There 
are marked growth rate changes over the period of direct observations, with a decreasing rate from the late-
1970s through the late-1990s, very little change in concentrations from 1999–2006, and resumed increases 
since 2006. Atmospheric CH₄ fluctuations result from complex variations of sources and sinks. A detailed 
discussion of recent methane trends and our understanding of their causes is presented in Cross-Chapter Box 
5.2. 
 
 
#### 2.2.3.3.3  Nitrous Oxide (N₂O) 
AR5 reported 324.2 ± 0.1 ppb for global surface annual mean N₂O in 2011; since then, it has increased by 
2.4% to 332.1 ± 0.4 ppb in 2019. Independent measurement networks agree well for both the global mean 
mixing ratio and relative change since 2011 (Table 2.2). Over 1995–2011, N₂O increased at an average rate 
of 0.79 ± 0.05 ppb yr<sup>–1</sup>. The growth rate has been higher in recent years, amounting to 0.96 ± 0.05 ppb yr<sup>–1</sup> 
from 2012 to 2019 (Figure 2.5c) (Section 5.2.3.5). 
 
 
### 2.2.3.4  Summary of changes in WMGHGs 
 
In summary, CO₂ has fluctuated by at least 2000 ppm over the last 450 Myr (medium confidence). The last 
time CO₂ concentrations were similar to the present-day was over 2 Ma (high confidence). Further, it is 
certain that WMGHG mixing ratios prior to industrialisation were lower than present-day levels and the 
growth rates of the WMGHGs from 1850 are unprecedented on centennial timescales in at least the last 800 
kyr. During the glacial-interglacial climate cycles over the last 800 kyr, the concentration variations of the 
WMGHG were 50–100 ppm for CO₂, 210–430 ppb for CH₄ and 60–90 ppb for N₂O. Between 1750–2019 
mixing ratios increased by 131.6 ± 2.9 ppm (47%), 1137 ± 10 ppb (156%), and 62 ± 6 ppb (23%), for CO₂, 
CH₄, and N₂O, respectively (very high confidence). Since 2011 (AR5) mixing ratios of CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O 
have further increased by 19 ppm, 63 ppb, and 7.7 ppb, reaching in 2019 levels of 409.9 (± 0.4) ppm, 1866.3 
(± 3.3) ppb, and 332.1 (± 0.4) ppb, respectively. By 2019, the combined ERF (relative to 1750) of CO₂, CH₄ 
and N₂O was 2.9 ± 0.5 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> (Table 2.2; Section 7.3.2). 

## 2.2.4  Halogenated Greenhouse Gases (CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs, PFCs, SF6 and others) 
 
This category includes ozone depleting substances (ODS), their replacements, and gases used industrially or 
produced as by-products. Some have natural sources (Section 6.2.2.4). AR5 reported that atmospheric 
abundances of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were decreasing in response to controls on production and 
consumption mandated by the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and its 
amendments. In contrast, abundances of both hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs, replacements for CFCs) 
and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs, replacements for HCFCs) were increasing. Atmospheric abundances of 
perfluorocarbons (PFCs), SF6, and NF3 were also increasing. 
 
Further details on ODS and other minor greenhouse gases can be found in the Scientific Assessment of 
Ozone Depletion: 2018 (Engel & Rigby, 2018; Montzka & Velders, 2018). Updated mixing ratios of the 
most radiatively important gases (ERF > 0.001 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup>) are reported in Table 2.2, and additional gases (ERF 
<0.001 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup>) are shown in Annex III. 
 
 
### 2.2.4.1  CFCs 
 
Atmospheric abundances of most CFCs have continued to decline since 2011 (AR5). The globally-averaged 
abundance of CFC-12 decreased by 25 ppt (4.8%) from 2011 to 2019, while CFC-11 decreased by about 11 
ppt (4.7%) over the same period (Table 2.2, Figure 2.6). Atmospheric abundances of some minor CFCs 
(CFC-13, CFC-115, CFC-113a) have increased since 2011 (Annex III), possibly related to use of HFCs 
(Laube et al., 2014). Overall, as of 2019 the ERF from CFCs has declined by 9 ± 0.5% from its maximum in 
2000, and 4.7 ± 0.6% since 2011 (Table 7.5). 
 
While global reporting indicated that CFC-11 production had essentially ceased by 2010, and the 
atmospheric abundance of CFC-11 is still decreasing, emissions inferred from atmospheric observations 
began increasing in 2013–2014 and remained elevated for 5–6 years, suggesting renewed and unreported 
production (Montzka et al., 2018; 2021; Park et al., 2021; Rigby et al., 2019). The global lifetimes of several 
ozone-depleting substances have been updated (SPARC, 2013), in particular for CFC-11 from 45 to 52 
years.  
 
<figref>2.6</figref>
 
 
### 2.2.4.2  HCFCs 
 
The atmospheric abundances of the major HCFCs (HCFC-22, HCFC-141b, HCFC-142b), primarily used in 
refrigeration and foam blowing, are increasing, but rates of increase have slowed in recent years (Figure 2.6). 
Global mean mixing ratios (Table 2.2) showed good concordance at the time of AR5 for the period 2005–2011.
For the period 2011–2019, the UCI network detected larger increases in HCFC-22, HCFC-141b, and 
HCFC-142b compared to the NOAA and AGAGE networks. Reasons for the discrepancy are presently 
unverified, but could be related to differences in sampling locations in the networks (Simpson et al., 2012). 
Emissions of HCFC-22, derived from atmospheric data, have remained relatively stable since 2012, while 
those of HCFC-141b and HCFC-142b have declined (Engel et al., 2018). Minor HCFCs, HCFC-133a and 
HCFC-31, have been detected in the atmosphere (currently less than 1 ppt) and may be unintentional by-
products of HFC production (Engel et al., 2018). 
 
 
### 2.2.4.3  HFCs, PFCs, SF6 and other radiatively important halogenated gases 
 
Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are replacements for CFCs and HCFCs. The atmospheric abundances of many 
HFCs increased between 2011 and 2019. HFC-134a (mobile air conditioning, foam blowing, and domestic 
refrigerators) increased by 71 % from 63 ppt in 2011 to 107.6 ppt in 2019 (Table 2.2). The UCI network 
detected a slightly smaller relative increase (53%). HFC-23, which is emitted as a by-product of HCFC-22 
production, increased by 8.4 ppt (35%) over 2011–2019. HFC-32 used as a substitute for HCFC-22, 
increased at least by 300%, and HFC-143a and HFC-125 showed increases of 100% and 187%, respectively. 
While the ERF of HFC-245fa is currently < 0.001 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup>, its atmospheric abundance doubled since 2011 to 
3.1 ppt in 2019 (Annex III). In contrast, HFC-152a is showing signs of stable (steady-state) abundance.  
  
Other radiatively important gases with predominantly anthropogenic sources also continue to increase in 
abundance. SF6, used in electrical distribution systems, magnesium production, and semi-conductor 
manufacturing, increased from 7.3 ppt in 2011 to 10.0 ppt in 2019 (+36%). Alternatives to SF6 or SF6-free 
equipment for electrical systems have become available in recent years, but SF6 is still widely in use in 
electrical switch gear (Simmonds et al., 2020). The global lifetime of SF6 has been revised from 3200 years 
to about 1000 years (Kovács et al., 2017; Ray et al., 2017) with implications for climate emission metrics 
(Section 7.6.2). NF3, which is used in the semi-conductor industry, increased 147% over the same period to 
2.05 ppt in 2019. Its contribution to ERF remains small, however, at 0.0004 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup>. The atmospheric 
abundance of SO2F2, which is used as a fumigant in place of ozone-depleting methyl bromide, reached 2.5 
ppt in 2019, a 46% increase from 2011. Its ERF also remains small at 0.0005 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup>.  
 
The global abundance of CCl4 continues to decline, down about 9.6% since 2011. Following a revision of the 
global lifetime from 26 to 32 years, and discovery of previously unknown sources (e.g. biproduct industrial 
emissions), knowledge of the CCl4 budget has improved. There is now better agreement between top-down 
emissions estimates (based on atmospheric measurements) and industry-based estimates (Engel et al., 2018). 
Halon-1211, mainly used for fire suppression, is also declining, and its ERF dropped below 0.001 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> in 2019.
While CH2Cl2 has a short atmospheric lifetime (6 months), and is not well-mixed, its abundance is 
increasing and its ERF is approaching 0.001 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup>. 
 
Perfluorocarbons CF4 and C2F6, which have exceedingly long global lifetimes, showed modest increases 
from 2011 to 2019. CF4, which has both natural and anthropogenic sources, increased 8.2% to 85.5 ppt, and 
C2F6 increased 16.3% to 4.85 ppt. c-C4F8, which is used in the electronics industry and may also be 
generated during the production of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, “Teflon”) and other fluoropolymers 
(Mühle et al., 2019), has increased 34% since 2011 to 1.75 ppt, although its ERF remains below 0.001 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup>. Other PFCs, present at mixing ratios < 1 ppt, have also been quantified (Droste et al., 2020; Annex III). 
 
 
### 2.2.4.4  Summary of changes in halogenated gases  
 
In summary, by 2019 the ERF of halogenated GHGs has increased 3.5% since 2011, reflecting 
predominantly a decrease in the atmospheric mixing ratios of CFCs and an increase in their replacements. 
However, average annual ERF growth rates associated with halogenated gases since 2011 are a factor of 
seven lower than in the 1970s and 1980s. Direct radiative forcings from CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs, and other 
halogenated greenhouse gases were 0.28, 0.06, 0.04, and 0.03 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> respectively, totalling 0.41 ± 0.07 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> in 2019 (see Table 7.5).  


## 2.2.5  Other short-lived gases 
 
### 2.2.5.1  Stratospheric water vapour 
 
AR5 assessed low confidence in stratospheric water vapour (SWV) trends based on substantial seasonal and 
interannual variability in satellite data from 1992 to 2011. The 1980–2010 record of balloon-borne frost 
point hygrometer measurements over Boulder, Colorado (40°N), showed an average net increase of 1.0 ± 0.2 
ppm (27 ± 6%) in the 16–26 km layer. 
 
Since AR5, bias-adjusted spatially comprehensive SWV measurements by different satellite sensors were 
merged to form continuous records (Hegglin et al., 2014; Froidevaux et al., 2015; Davis et al., 2016). These 
indicate no net global increase of SWV in the lower stratosphere since the late 1980s. Hegglin et al. (2014)  
reported a latitudinal dependence of SWV trends and suggested that the upward trend over Boulder should 
not be considered representative of the global stratosphere, while Lossow et al. (2018) showed insignificant 
differences between SWV trends at Boulder and those for the 35–45°N zonal mean from 1980 to 2010 using 
model simulations and satellite observations.  
 
Recent studies of dynamical influences on SWV (Eguchi et al., 2015; Evan et al., 2015; Tao et al., 2015; 
Konopka et al., 2016; Diallo et al., 2018; Garfinkel et al., 2018) have demonstrated that the quasi-biennial 
oscillation (QBO), El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW) events and 
possibly also Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV) (Wang W. et al., 2016), can significantly influence SWV 
abundance and the tropical cold point tropopause temperatures that largely control water vapour entering the 
stratosphere. It has also been shown that the convective lofting of ice can moisten the lower stratosphere over 
large regions (Dessler et al., 2016; Anderson et al., 2017; Avery et al., 2017). Near-global observations of 
SWV have revealed unusually strong and abrupt interannual changes, especially in the tropical lower 
stratosphere. Between December 2015 and November 2016, the tropical mean SWV anomaly at 82 hPa 
dropped from 0.9 ± 0.1 ppm to –1.0 ± 0.1 ppm, accompanied by highly anomalous QBO-related dynamics in 
the tropical stratosphere (Newman P. et al., 2016; Tweedy et al., 2017) and the transition of ENSO from 
strong El Niño to La Niña conditions (Davis et al., 2017). The tropical mean SWV anomaly then rose 
sharply to 0.7 ± 0.1 ppm in June 2017 as warm westerlies returned to the tropical lower stratosphere and 
ENSO neutral conditions prevailed (Davis et al., 2017).  
 
In summary, in situ measurements at a single mid-latitude location indicate about a 25% net increase in 
stratospheric water vapour since 1980, while merged satellite data records since the late 1980s suggest little 
net change. Recent studies of dynamical influences on SWV have highlighted their substantial roles in 
driving large interannual variability that complicates trend detection. There thus continues to be low 
confidence in trends of SWV over the instrumental period. Disregarding dynamic influences on SWV, an 
ERF of 0.05 ± 0.05 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> is estimated for SWV produced by CH₄ oxidation (Section 7.3.2.6), unchanged 
from AR5. 
 
 
### 2.2.5.2  Stratospheric ozone 
 
AR5 assessed that it was certain that global stratospheric ozone from the mid-1990s to 2011 was nearly 
constant and about 3.5% lower than in the reference period 1964–1980. Most of the declines occurred prior 
to the mid-1990s.  
 
Global annual mean total ozone (Figure 2.7) significantly declined by about 3.5% during the 1980s and the 
early 1990s and by 2.5% over 60°S–60°N (near-global). Then, during 2000–2017, both global and near-
global concentrations increased slightly, but not significantly, all in line with production and consumption 
limits of ODS regulated under the Montreal Protocol and its amendments. Near-global 2014–2017 mean 
total ozone is about 2.2% below the pre-ozone depletion 1964–1980 average (Braesicke et al., 2018). At 
southern and northern mid-latitudes, declines are 5.5% and 3.0% compared to the 1964–1980 average 
respectively. Total ozone remained practically unchanged in the tropics (Braesicke et al., 2018). Emission of 
ODS started before 1980 and some estimates suggest that as much as 40% of the long-term ozone loss 
occurred between 1960 and 1980 (Shepherd et al., 2014), lowering the 1964–1980 baseline values by about 
1% (outside the polar regions), a value close to observational uncertainties. The world’s longest record of 
total ozone measurements from Arosa, Switzerland, initiated in 1926, does not show any substantial long-
term changes before about 1980 (Staehelin et al., 2018).  
 
<figref>2.7</figref>
 
ERF depends strongly on the altitude of ozone changes. Two stratospheric regions are mainly responsible for 
long-term changes outside the polar regions. In the upper stratosphere (35–45 km), there was a strong decline 
(about 10%) from the start of observations in 1979 up to the mid-1990s and a subsequent increase by about 
4% to present (SPARC/IO3C/GAW, 2019). In the lower stratosphere (20–25 km), there also was a 
statistically significant decline (7–8%) up to the mid-1990s, followed by stabilization or a small further 
decline (Ball et al., 2018; 2019), although the natural variability is too strong to make a conclusive statement 
(Chipperfield et al., 2018). 
 
The strongest ozone loss in the stratosphere continues to occur in austral spring over Antarctica (ozone hole) 
with emergent signs of recovery after 2000 (Langematz et al., 2018). Interannual variability in polar 
stratospheric ozone is driven by large scale winds and temperatures, and, to a lesser extent, by the 
stratospheric aerosol loading and the solar cycle. This variability is particularly large in the Arctic, where the 
largest depletion events, comparable to a typical event in the Antarctic, occurred in 2011 (Manney et al., 
2011; Langematz et al., 2018) and again in 2020 (Grooß and Müller, 2020; Manney et al., 2020). Further 
details on trends and ERF can be found in sections 6.3.2 and 7.3.2.5.  
 
In summary, compared to the 1964–1980 average, stratospheric ozone columns outside polar regions (60°S–
60°N) declined by about 2.5% over 1980–1995, and stabilized after 2000, with 2.2% lower values in 2014–2017. Large ozone depletions continue to appear in spring in the Antarctic and, in particularly cold years, 
also in the Arctic. Model based estimates disagree on the sign of the ERF due to stratospheric ozone changes, 
but agree that it is much smaller in magnitude than that due to tropospheric ozone changes (Section 7.3.2.5). 
 
 
### 2.2.5.3  Tropospheric ozone 
 
AR5 assessed medium confidence in large-scale increases of tropospheric ozone at rural surface sites across 
the NH (1970–2010), and in a doubling of European surface ozone during the 20th century, with the 
increases of surface ozone in the SH being of low confidence. Surface ozone likely increased in East Asia, 
but levelled off or decreased in the eastern USA and Western Europe. Free tropospheric trends (1971–2010) 
from ozonesondes and aircraft showed positive trends in most, but not all, assessed regions, and for most 
seasons and altitudes. This section focuses on large scale ozone changes; chemical and physical processes 
and regional changes in tropospheric ozone are assessed in Section 6.3.2.1 and Section 7.3.2.5 assesses 
radiative forcing.   
 
Prior to 1850 ozone observations do not exist, but a recent analysis using clumped-isotope composition of 
molecular oxygen (18O18O in O2) trapped in polar firn and ice, combined with atmospheric chemistry model 
simulations, constrains the global tropospheric ozone increase to less than 40% between 1850 and 2005, with 
most of this increase occurring between 1950 and 1980 (Yeung et al., 2019). Recently, the Tropospheric 
Ozone Assessment Report identified and evaluated 60 records of surface ozone observations collected at 
rural locations worldwide between 1896 and 1975, which were based on a range of measurement techniques 
with potentially large uncertainties (Tarasick et al., 2019). They found that from the mid-20th century (1930s 
to the early 1970s) to 1990–2014, rural surface ozone increased by 30–70% across the northern extra-tropics. 
This is smaller than the 100% 20th century increase reported in AR5, which relied on far fewer measurement 
sites, all in Europe. In the northern tropics limited low-elevation historical data (1954–1975) provide no clear 
indication of surface ozone increases (Tarasick et al., 2019). However, similar to the northern mid-latitude 
increases, lower-free tropospheric ozone at Mauna Loa, Hawaii increased by approximately 50% from the 
late 1950s to present (Cooper et al., 2020). Historical observations are too limited to draw conclusions on 
surface ozone trends in the SH tropics and mid-latitudes since the mid-20th century, with tropospheric ozone 
exhibiting little change across Antarctica (Tarasick et al., 2019; Cooper et al., 2020). Based on reliable UV 
absorption measurements at remote locations (surface and lower troposphere), ozone trends since the mid-
1990s varied spatially at northern mid-latitudes, but increased in the northern tropics (2-17%; 1-6 ppbv per 
decade) (Cooper et al., 2020; Gaudel et al., 2020). Across the SH these more recent observations are too 
limited to determine zonal trends (e.g. tropics, mid-latitudes, high latitudes). 
 
The earliest observations of free tropospheric ozone (1934–1955) are available from northern mid-latitudes 
where limited data indicate a tropospheric column ozone increase of 48 ± 30% up to 1990–2012 (Tarasick et 
al., 2019). Starting in the 1960s, records from ozonesondes show no significant changes in the free 
troposphere over the Arctic and mid-latitude regions of Canada, but trends are mainly positive elsewhere in 
the northern mid-latitudes (Cooper et al., 2020; Oltmans et al., 2013). Tropospheric column and free 
tropospheric trends since the mid-1990s based on commercial aircraft, ozonesonde observations and satellite 
retrievals (Figure 2.8b,c), are overwhelmingly positive across the northern mid-latitudes (2–7%; 1–4 ppbv 
per decade) and tropics (2–14%; 1–5 ppbv per decade), with the largest increases (8–14%; 3–6 ppbv per 
decade) in the northern tropics in the vicinity of southern Asia and Indonesia. Observations in the SH are 
limited, but indicate average tropospheric column ozone increases of 2–12% (1–5 ppbv) per decade in the 
tropics (Figure 2.8c), and weak tropospheric column ozone increases (< 5%, < 1 ppbv per decade ) at mid-
latitudes (Cooper et al., 2020). Above Antarctica, mid-tropospheric ozone has increased since the late 20th 
century (Oltmans et al., 2013). The total ozone ERF from 1750 to 2019 best estimate is assessed as 0.47 W 
m-2 (7.3.2.5) and this is dominated by increases in the troposphere. The underlying modelled global 
tropospheric ozone column increase (Skeie et al., 2020) from 1850 to 2010 of 40–60%, is somewhat higher 
than the isotope based upper-limit of Yeung et al., (2019). At mid-latitudes (30°–60° N) model increases of 
30–40% since the mid-20th century are broadly consistent with observations. 
 
In summary, limited available isotopic evidence constrains the global tropospheric ozone increase to less 
than 40% between 1850 and 2005 (low confidence). Based on sparse historical surface/low altitude data 
tropospheric ozone has increased since the mid-20th century by 30–70% across the NH (medium 
confidence). Surface / low altitude ozone trends since the mid-1990s are variable at northern mid-latitudes, 
but positive in the tropics [2 to 17% per decade] (high confidence). Since the mid-1990s, free tropospheric 
ozone has increased by 2–7% per decade in most regions of the northern mid-latitudes, and 2–12% per 
decade in the sampled regions of the northern and southern tropics (high confidence). Limited coverage by 
surface observations precludes identification of zonal trends in the SH, while observations of tropospheric 
column ozone indicate increases of less than 5% per decade at southern mid-latitudes (medium confidence).

## 2.2.6  Aerosols 
 
AR5 assessed large-scale Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) trends over 2000–2009, concluding that there was 
low confidence in a global trend, but that AOD very likely decreased from 1990 onwards over Europe and the 
eastern USA, and increased since 2000 over eastern and southern Asia. The ERF associated with aerosol-
radiation interactions for 2011 (relative to 1750) was estimated to be -0.45 ± 0.5 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> and of aerosol-cloud 
interaction estimated as -0.45 [-1.2–0.0] W⋅m<sup>–2</sup>. Aerosol ERF uncertainty was assessed as the largest 
contributor to the overall ERF uncertainty since 1750.  
 
This section assesses the observed large-scale temporal evolution of tropospheric aerosols. Aerosol-related 
processes, chemical and physical properties, and links to air quality, are assessed in Chapter 6. An in-depth 
assessment of aerosol interactions with radiation and clouds is provided in Section 7.3.3. 
 
Aerosol proxy records of improved temporal resolution and quality are now available (Dornelas et al., 2018; 
Jacobel et al., 2017; Kylander et al., 2016; Middleton et al., 2018; Stevens et al., 2016; 2018), which further 
advance synthesis of new global compilations of aerosol loadings (Lambert et al., 2015; Albani et al., 2016). 
Estimates of the glacial / interglacial ratio in global dust deposition are within the range of 2–4 (Albani et al., 
2015; Lambert et al., 2015). New reconstructions indicate a ratio of 3–5 for the glacial / interglacial loadings 
for mid- and high-latitude ocean of both hemispheres (Lamy et al., 2014; Martinez-Garcia et al., 2014; Serno 
et al., 2015). Improved quantification of changes in dust deposition from North Africa and North Atlantic 
sediment records confirms dust deposition rates lower by a factor 2–5 during the African Humid Period (10–
5 ka) compared to the late Holocene (McGee et al., 2013; Albani et al., 2015; Middleton et al., 2018; Palchan 
& Torfstein, 2019). During the Holocene, biogenic emissions and volcanic activity drove significant 
variability (up to one order of magnitude) in sulphate concentrations (Schüpbach et al., 2018).  
 
Ice cores allow for estimation of multi-centennial trends in mid- and high-latitude aerosol deposition, 
including those for sulphate and black carbon (Figure 2.9 a, b). Sulphate in ice cores increased by a factor of 
8 from the end of the 19th century to the 1970s in continental Europe, by a factor of 4 from the 1940s to the 
1970s in Russia, and by a factor of 3 from the end of the 19th century to 1950 in the Arctic (Svalbard). In all 
regions studied, concentrations have declined by about a factor of 2 following their peak (around 1970 in 
Europe and Russia, and 1950 in the Arctic). Strong increases of black carbon (BC) were observed in the 20th 
century over Europe, Russia, Greenland (primarily originating from emissions from North America), and in 
the Arctic (Svalbard). South America exhibits a small positive trend (Figure 2.9). BC concentrations in 
various Antarctic ice cores were below 1 ng g-1 without a clear trend.  
 
Spatially resolved trends of AOD derived from Aqua/Terra MISR and MODIS instruments over 2000–2019 
range between -2% and 2% per year (Figure 2.9c). Ground-based solar attenuation networks help to 
constrain and improve the satellite-derived retrievals of AOD, and trends derived from the AERONET 
network (Figure 2.9c, d) corroborate satellite results (Bauer et al., 2020; Georgoulias et al., 2016; Wei et al., 
2019; Yu et al., 2020) in particular for declines over Europe (Stjern et al., 2011; Cherian et al., 2014; Li et 
al., 2014) and the USA (Jongeward et al., 2016; Li et al., 2014). The tendency in AOD over East Asia 
reversed from positive (2000–2010) to negative (since 2010) (Filonchyk et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2019; Samset 
et al., 2019; Sogacheva et al., 2018). Over southern Asia, however, AOD from satellite (MODIS / MISR) 
and AERONET retrievals show continuing increases (Li et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2017), with similar trends 
from UV-based aerosol retrievals from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on the Aura satellite 
(Dahutia et al., 2018; Hammer et al., 2018). A comparison of MODIS and MISR radiometric observations 
with the broadband CERES satellite instrument (Corbett and Loeb, 2015) showed that drifts in calibration 
are unlikely to affect the satellite derived trends. CERES shows patterns for clear-sky broadband radiation 
consistent with the aerosol spatio-temporal changes (Loeb et al., 2018; Paulot et al., 2018).  
 
Satellite-derived trends are further supported by in situ regional surface concentration measurements, 
operational since the 1980s (sulphate) and 1990s (PM2.5) from a global compilation (Coen et al., 2020) of 
networks over Europe (Stjern et al., 2011), North America (Jongeward et al., 2016), and China (Zheng et al., 
2018). Collaud Coen et al. (2020) report from surface observations across the NH mid-latitudes that aerosol 
absorption coefficients decreased since the first decade of the 21st century. 
 
Anthropogenic aerosol is predominantly found in the fraction of particles with radii <1 µm that comprise the 
fine-mode AOD (AODf) (Kinne, 2019) (Figure 2.9d). A significant decline in AODf of more than 1.5% per 
year from 2000 to 2019 has occurred over Europe and North America, while there have been positive trends 
of up to 1.5% per year over Southern Asia and East Africa. The global-scale trend in AODf of –0.03% per 
year (Figure 2.9) is significant. The results are consistent with trend estimates from an aerosol reanalysis 
(Bellouin et al., 2020), and the trends in satellite-derived cloud droplet number concentrations are consistent 
with the aerosol trends (Cherian and Quaas, 2020). Cloudiness and cloud radiative properties trends are, 
however, less conclusive possibly due to their large variability (Norris et al., 2016; Cherian and Quaas, 
2020). Further details on aerosol-cloud interactions are assessed in Section 7.3.3.2. 
 
<figref>2.9</figref> 
 
To conclude, atmospheric aerosols sampled by ice cores, influenced by northern mid-latitude emissions, 
show positive trends from 1700 until the last quarter of the 20th century and decreases thereafter (high 
confidence), but there is low confidence in observations of systematic changes in other parts of the world in 
these periods. Satellite data and ground-based records indicate that AOD exhibits predominantly negative 
trends since 2000 over NH mid-latitudes and SH continents, but increased over South Asia and East Africa 
(high confidence). A globally deceasing aerosol abundance is thus assessed with medium confidence. This 
implies increasing net positive ERF, since the overall negative aerosol ERF has become smaller. 
 
 
## 2.2.7  Land use and land cover 
 
AR5 assessed that land use change very likely increased the Earth’s albedo with a radiative forcing of -0.15 
(± 0.10) W⋅m<sup>–2</sup>. AR5 also assessed that a net cooling of the surface, accounting for processes that are not 
limited to the albedo, was about as likely as not. SRCCL concluded with medium confidence that the 
biophysical effects of land cover change (mainly increased albedo) had a cooling effect on surface 
temperatures. SRCCL also concluded with very high confidence that the biogeochemical effects of land 
cover change (i.e., GHG emissions) resulted in a mean annual surface warming. 
 
Much of the global land surface has been modified or managed to some extent by human activities during the 
Holocene. Reconstructions based on pollen data indicate that natural vegetation probably covered most of 
the Earth’s ice-free terrestrial surface until roughly the mid-Holocene (Harrison et al., 2020;  Li et al., 2020; 
Marquer et al., 2017). Reconstructions based on pollen, archaeological, and historical data indicate 
deforestation at the regional scale since at least 6 ka (Harrison et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Marquer et al., 
2017; Stephens et al., 2019). From a global perspective, land-use forcing datasets (Lawrence et al., 2016) 
estimate that changes in land use (and related deforestation) were small on the global scale until the mid-19th 
century and accelerated markedly thereafter, with larger uncertainties prior to industrialization (Kaplan et al., 
2017). Since the early 1980s, about 60% of all land cover changes have been associated with direct human 
activities, with spatial patterns emphasizing the regional character of land use and land management, 
including tropical deforestation, temperate afforestation, cropland intensification, and increased urbanization 
(Song et al., 2018, Zeng et al., 2018). At present, nearly three-quarters of the ice-free terrestrial surface is 
under some form of human use (Venter et al., 2016; Erb et al., 2017), particularly in agriculture and forest 
management.  
 
The impact of historical land-cover change on global climate is assessed with model simulations that 
consider multiple climate and biophysical processes (e.g., changes in albedo, evapotranspiration, and 
roughness) and / or biogeochemical processes (e.g., changes in atmospheric composition such as carbon 
release from deforestation). The dominant biophysical response to land cover changes is albedo, which is 
estimated (using a MODIS albedo product and a historical land-use harmonization product) to have 
increased gradually prior to the mid-19th century and then strongly through the mid-20th century, with a 
slightly slower rise thereafter (Ghimire et al., 2014). Recent radiative forcing estimates arising from 
biophysical processes generally fall at the lower end of the AR5 assessed range. For instance, based on  
historical simulations from 13 CMIP6 models, Smith et al., (2020) estimated that the ERF from surface 
albedo changes (including snow cover and leaf area) was -0.08 [-0.22 to 0.06] W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> since 1850. Similarly, 
based on simulations from 13 CMIP5 models, Lejeune et al., (2020) estimated the radiative forcing from 
transitions between trees, crops, and grasslands was -0.11 [-0.16 to 0.04] W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> since 1860. Andrews et al., 
(2017) identified an ERF of -0.40 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> since 1860, ascribing much of the effect to increases in albedo 
(including the unmasking of underlying snow cover); notably, however, the analysis was based on a single 
model with a known tendency to overestimate the ERF (Collins et al., 2011). Ward et al. (2014) examined 
the combined effects of biophysical and biogeochemical processes, obtaining an RF of 0.9 ± 0.5 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup>  since 
1850 that was driven primarily by increases in land-use related GHG emissions from deforestation and 
agriculture (Ward and Mahowald, 2015). According to a large suite of historical simulations, the biophysical 
effects of changes in land cover (i.e. increased surface albedo and decreased turbulent heat fluxes) led to a 
net global cooling of 0.10 ± 0.14 °C at the surface (SRCCL). Available model simulations suggest that 
biophysical and biogeochemical effects jointly may have contributed to a small global warming of 0.078 ± 
0.093 °C at the surface over about the past two centuries (SRCCL), with a potentially even larger warming 
contribution over the Holocene as a whole (He et al., 2014). 
 
In summary, biophysical effects from historical changes in land use have an overall negative ERF (medium 
confidence). The best-estimate ERF from the increase in global albedo is -0.15 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup>since 1700 and -0.12 
W⋅m<sup>–2</sup>since 1850 (medium confidence; Section 7.3.4.1). Biophysical effects of land-use change likely 
resulted in a net global cooling of about 0.1°C since 1750 (medium confidence; Section 7.3.5.3). 
 
 
## 2.2.8  Effective radiative forcing (ERF) exerted by the assessed climate drivers 
 
AR5 concluded that changes in climate drivers over the industrial period corresponded to a positive ERF 
which increased more rapidly after 1970 than before. There was very high confidence in the positive ERF 
due to WMGHG, with CO₂ the single largest contributor. AR5 concluded that there was high confidence that 
aerosols have offset a substantial portion of the WMGHG forcing.  
 
This section reports the evolution in ERF with respect to 1750 as assessed in Section 7.3 and relies on the 
observed changes in climate drivers as assessed in Section 2.2 wherever possible, and models otherwise. The 
ERF is assessed using the methods and details described in Section 7.3.1 and includes, in addition to the 
radiative forcing, the rapid adjustments, especially implied by clouds. The time series are shown in Figure 
2.10. 

Increasing TSI (Section 2.2.1) implies a small ERF of less than 0.1 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> between 1900 and 1980. TSI 
varies over the 11-year solar cycle with ERF of order ± 0.1 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> in the assessed period. Strong volcanic 
eruptions (Section 2.2.2) with periods of strong negative ERF lasting 2–5 years in duration occurred in the 
late 19th and early 20th centuries. There followed a relatively quiescent period between about 1920 and 
1960, and then three strong eruptions in 1963, 1982 and 1991, and only small-to-moderate eruptions 
thereafter (Schmidt et al., 2018).  
 
The atmospheric concentrations of WMGHGs (Section 2.2.3) have continuously increased since the early 
19th century, with CO₂ contributing the largest share of the positive ERF. Compared to the last two decades 
of the 20th century, the growth rate of CO₂ in the atmosphere increased in the 21st century, showed strong 
fluctuations for CH₄, and was about constant for N₂O. Mixing ratios of the most abundant CFCs declined 
(Section 2.2.4). Mixing ratios of HCFCs increased, but growth rates are starting to decelerate. Mixing ratios 
of HFCs and some other human-made components are increasing (Section 2.2.4). The ERF for CO₂ alone is 
stronger than for all the other anthropogenic WMGHGs taken together throughout the industrial period, and 
its relative importance has increased in recent years (Figures 2.10, 7.6). 
 
<figref>2.10</figref> 
 
Among the gaseous short-lived climate forcers (Section 2.2.5, Chapter 6, Section 7.3; excluding CH₄ here), 
ozone (O3) is the component with the largest (positive) ERF. Concentrations from direct observations have 
increased since the mid-20th century and, mostly based on models, this extends to since 1750. Other gaseous 
short-lived climate forcers have small contributions to total ERF. 
 
The net effect of aerosols (Sections 2.2.6, 6.4) on the radiation budget, including their effect on clouds, and 
cloud adjustments, as well as the deposition of black carbon on snow (Section 7.3.4.3), was negative 
throughout the industrial period (high confidence). The net effect strengthened (becoming more negative) 
over most of the 20th century, but more likely than not weakened (becoming less negative) since the late 
20th century. These trends are reflected in measurements of surface solar radiation (Section 7.2.2.3) and the 
Earth’s energy imbalance (Section 7.2.2.1). The relative importance of aerosol forcing compared to other 
forcing agents has decreased globally in the most recent 30 years (medium confidence) and the reduction of 
the negative forcing in the 21st century enhances the overall positive ERF. 
 
Land use and land cover changes (Section 2.2.7) over the industrial period introduce a negative radiative 
forcing by increasing the surface albedo. This effect increased since 1750, reaching current values of about –
0.20 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> (medium confidence). This ERF value is taken from Section 7.3.4.1 and is different from the 
assessment in Section 2.2.7 in that it also includes the effect of irrigation. It also includes uncertain rapid 
adjustments and thus there is low confidence in its magnitude. Biogeochemical feedbacks can be substantial 
(Section 5.4) and are not included in ERF. 
 
In conclusion, the net ERF due to all observed changes in climate drivers is positive, except for short periods 
(up to a few years in duration) following moderate to large volcanic eruptions, and has grown in magnitude 
since the late 19th century. The rate of change likely has increased in the last 30 years, since CO₂ 
concentrations increased at an increasing rate due to growing CO₂ emissions (very likely), and since the 
aerosol forcing became less negative (more likely than not).  


# 2.3  Changes in large-scale climate 
 
<boxref>Cross-Chapter Box 2.2</boxref> 
 
## 2.3.1  Atmosphere and Earth's surface 
 
### 2.3.1.1  Surface temperatures 
 
#### 2.3.1.1.1  Temperatures of the deep past (65 Ma to 8 ka) 

This assessment of the paleo reference periods (Cross-Chapter Box 2.1) draws from studies based mostly or 
entirely on indirect observational evidence from geological archives (i.e. proxy records) rather than 
reconstructions that rely more heavily on modelled parameters and those based on deep-ocean temperatures 
(e.g. Köhler et al., 2015; Friedrich et al., 2016). In contrast to AR5, temperature estimates from climate 
models are not included in the assessed values for paleo reference periods in this chapter. AR5 concluded 
that the reconstructed GMST during the PETM was 4°C–7°C warmer than pre-PETM mean climate (low 
confidence), and that the EECO and the MPWP were 9°C–14°C and 1.9°C–3.6°C warmer than pre-
industrial, respectively (medium confidence). The GMST during the LIG was assessed at 1°C–2°C warmer 
than pre-industrial (medium confidence), whereas SROCC narrowed the range to 0.5°C–1.0°C warmer, but 
did not state a confidence level. AR5 further concluded that it was very likely that the LGM was 3°C–8°C 
colder than pre-industrial, and likely that the maximum rate of global warming during the subsequent 
deglacial period was 1°C–1.5°C kyr<sup>–1</sup>. 
 
For the PETM, new reconstructions agree with those assessed by AR5. A major new compilation of proxy 
temperature data (Hollis et al., 2019) analysed using multiple statistical approaches (Inglis et al., 2020) 
indicates that GMST was 10°C–25°C (90% range) warmer than 1850–1900, or about 5°C warmer relative to 
the pre-PETM state. A related synthesis study also estimates that PETM warmed by 5°C (no uncertainty 
assigned; Zhu et al., 2019). A recent benthic isotope compilation (Westerhold et al., 2020) transformed to 
GMST based on the formulation by Hansen et al. (2013c) (Cross-Chapter Box 2.1, Figure 1), and adjusted to 
1850-1900 by adding 0.36°C, shows an increase of GMST by about 10°C during the PETM. This reflects the 
expected higher variability at single sites that were used to splice together the composite time series, 
compared to the globally averaged composite time series of Zachos et al. (2008). The latter was originally 
used by Hansen et al. (2013c) to reconstruct GMST, and is the preferred representation of the global average 
bottom water conditions, despite its less well-refined chronology. 
 
For the EECO, new GMST reconstructions fall at the high end of the range assessed by AR5. These include 
estimates of 7°C–18°C (90% range; Inglis et al., 2020) and 12°C–18°C (95% range; Zhu et al., 2019) 
warmer than 1850–1900, and 10°C–16°C warmer than 1995-2014 “recent past” conditions (2 standard error 
range; Caballero & Huber, 2013). Together, they indicate that GMST was 10°C–18°C warmer during the 
EECO compared with 1850–1900 (medium confidence).  
 
AR5 did not assess the GMST for the MCO. Reconstructions based on data from multiple study sites include 
estimates of about 4℃ (uncertainty range not specified; You et al., 2009) and 5°C–10℃ (2 standard error 
range; Goldner et al., 2014) warmer than 1850–1900. Together, these studies indicate that GMST was 4°C–
10°C warmer during the MCO (medium confidence). 
 
For the MPWP, new proxy-based estimates of global sea surface temperatures (SST) are about 2.0°C–3.5˚C 
warmer than 1850–1900, depending on which proxy types are included in the analysis (Foley and Dowsett, 
2019; McClymont et al., 2020). On the basis of model-derived relationships between land versus sea surface 
temperatures under different climate states (Section 3.3.1.1, Figure 3.2b), the increase in GMST is estimated 
to have been roughly 15% greater than the increase in global SST. Therefore, GMST during the MPWP is 
estimated to have been 2.5°C–4.0°C warmer than 1850–1900 (medium confidence). 
 
For the LIG (Cross-Chapter Box 2.1, Figure 1; Figure 2.11), a major new compilation of marine proxy data 
(Turney et al., 2020) from 203 sites indicates that the average SST from 129–125 ka was 1.0°C ± 0.2°C 
(2SD) warmer than 1850–1900 (reported relative to 1981–2010 and adjusted here by 0.8°C). These 
temperatures represent the time of peak warmth, which may not have been synchronous among these sites. 
This compares with two other SST estimates for 125 ka of 0.5°C ± 0.3°C (± 2 SD) warmer at 125 ka relative 
to 1870–1889 (Hoffman et al., 2017), and about 1.4°C (no uncertainty stated) warmer at 125 ka relative to 
1850–1900 (Friedrich and Timmermann, 2020; reported relative to 10–5 ka and adjusted here by 0.4°C; 
(Kaufman et al., 2020a)). The average of these post-AR5 global SST anomalies is 1°C. Commensurately 
(Figure 3.2b), GMST is estimated to have been roughly 1.1°C above 1850-1900 values, although this value 
could be too high if peak warmth was not globally synchronous (Capron et al., 2017). A further estimate of 
peak GMST anomalies of 1.0°C–3.5°C (90% range; adjusted here to 1850–1900 by adding 0.2°C) based on 
59 marine sediment cores (Snyder, 2016) is considerably warmer than remaining estimates and are therefore 
given less weight in the final assessment. The warmest millennium of the LIG GMST reconstruction in the 
Hansen et al. (2013c) is 1.5°C above 1850-1900. In summary, GMST during the warmest millennia of the 
LIG (within the interval of around 129–125 ka) is estimated to have reached 0.5°C–1.5°C higher values than 
the 1850–1990 reference period (medium confidence).  
 
New GMST reconstructions for the LGM fall near the middle of AR5’s very likely range, which was based 
on a combination of proxy reconstructions and model simulations. Two of these new reconstructions use 
marine proxies to reconstruct global SST that were scaled to GMST based on different assumptions. One 
indicates that GMST was 6.2 [4.5 to 8.1°C; 95% range] cooler than the late Holocene average (Snyder, 
2016), and the other, 5.7°C ± 0.8°C (2 SD) cooler than the average of the first part of the Holocene (10–5 ka)  
(Friedrich and Timmermann, 2020). A third new estimate (Tierney et al., 2020) uses a much larger 
compilation of marine proxies along with a data-assimilation procedure, rather than scaling, to reconstruct a 
GMST of 6.1°C ± 0.4°C (2 SD) cooler than the late Holocene. Assuming that the 1850–1900 reference 
period was 0.2°C and 0.4°C cooler than the late and first part of the Holocene, respectively (Kaufman et al., 
2020a), the midpoints of these three new GMST reconstructions average -5.8°C relative to 1850–1900. The 
coldest multi-century period of the LGM in the Hansen et al. (2013c) reconstruction is 4.3°C colder than 
1850–1900. This compares to land- and SST-only estimates of about -6.1°C ± 2°C and -2.2°C ± 1°C, 
respectively (2 SD), which are based on AR5-generation studies that imply a warmer GMST than more 
recent reconstructions (Fig. 1c in Harrison et al., 2015; Fig. 7 in Harrison et al., 2016). A major new pollen-
based data-assimilation reconstruction averages 6.9°C cooler over northern extratropical land (Cleator et al., 
2020). LGM temperature variability on centennial scales was about four times higher globally than during 
the Holocene, and even greater at high latitudes (Rehfeld et al., 2018). In summary, GMST is estimated to 
have been 5°C–7°C lower during the LGM (around 23–19 ka) compared with 1850–1900 (medium 
confidence).  
 
For the LDT (Cross-Chapter Box 2.1, Figure 1), no new large-scale studies have been published since AR5 
(Shakun et al., 2012) to further assess the rate of GMST change during this period of rapid global warming 
(estimated at 1°C–1.5°C per kyr). The reconstruction of Shakun et al. (2012) was based primarily on SST 
records and therefore underrepresents the change in GMST during the LDT. Temperature over Greenland 
increased by about ten times that rate during the centuries of most rapid warming (Jansen et al., 2020). 
 
 
#### 2.3.1.1.2  Temperatures of the post-glacial period (past 7000 years) 

AR5 did not include an assessment of large-scale temperature estimates for the MH, although it assigned 
high confidence to the long-term cooling trend over mid- to high-latitudes of the NH during the 5 kyr that 
preceded recent warming. For average annual NH temperatures, the period 1983–2012 was assessed as very 
likely the warmest 30-year period of the past 800 years (high confidence) and likely the warmest 30-year 
period of the past 1.4 kyr (medium confidence); the warm multi-decadal periods prior to the 20th century 
were unsynchronized across regions, in contrast to the warming since the mid-20th century (high 
confidence), although only sparse information was available from the SH.  
 
This section concerns the Holocene period prior to industrialization when GMST was overall highest. 
Whereas SR1.5 focussed upon the ‘Holocene thermal maximum’ when regional temperatures were up to 1°C 
higher than 1850-1900, though peak warming occurred regionally at different times between around 10 and 5 
ka greatly complicating interpretation. A multi-method reconstruction (Kaufman et al., 2020a) based on a 
quality-controlled, multi-proxy synthesis of paleo-temperature records from 470 terrestrial and 209 marine 
sites globally (Kaufman et al., 2020b) indicates that the median GMST of the warmest two-century-long 
interval was 0.7  [0.3 to 1.8] °C warmer than 1800–1900 (which averaged 0.03°C colder than 1850–1900; 
PAGES 2k Consortium, 2019), and was centred around 6.5 ka. This is similar to Marcott et al. (2013), which 
is based on a smaller dataset (73 sites) and different procedures to estimate a maximum warmth of 0.8°C ± 
0.3°C (2 SD)  at around 7.0 ka, adjusted here by adding 0.3°C to account for differences in reference periods. 
These may be underestimates because averaging inherently smoothed proxy records with uncertain 
chronologies reduces the variability in the temperature reconstruction (e.g., Dolman & Laepple (2018) for 
sedimentary archives). However, the general coincidence between peak warmth and astronomically driven 
boreal summer insolation might reflect a bias toward summer conditions (Bova et al., 2021; Hou et al., 2019; 
Liu et al., 2014), suggesting that the estimate is too high. This possibility is supported by AR5-generation 
proxy data focusing on 6 ka (Harrison et al., 2014), the long-standing MH modelling target (Cross-Chapter 
Box 2.1), that indicate surface temperatures for land and ocean were indistinguishable from ‘pre-industrial’ 
climate (Fig. 1c in Harrison et al., 2015; Fig. 7 in Harrison et al., 2016). In contrast, the GMST estimate from 
the multi-method global reconstruction (Kaufman et al., 2020a) for the millennium centred on 6 ka is only 
about 0.1°C colder than the warmest millennium.  
 
Taking all lines of evidence into account, the GMST averaged over the warmest centuries of the current 
interglacial period (sometime between around 6 and 7 ka) is estimated to have been 0.2°C–1.0°C higher than 
1850–1900 (medium confidence). It is therefore more likely than not that no multi-centennial interval during 
the post-glacial period was warmer globally than the most recent decade (which was 1.1°C warmer than 
1850–1900; Section 2.3.1.1.3); the LIG (129–116 ka) is the next most recent candidate for a period of higher 
global temperature. Zonally averaged mean annual temperature reconstructions (Routson et al., 2019) 
indicate that MH warmth was most pronounced north of 30°N latitude, and that GMST subsequently 
decreased in general, albeit with multi-century variability, with greater cooling in the NH than in the SH 
(Kaufman et al., 2020a). 
 
The temperature history of the last millennium and the methods used to reconstruct it have been studied 
extensively, both prior to and following AR5, as summarized recently by Smerdon and Pollack (2016) and 
Christiansen and Ljungqvist (2017). New regional (e.g., Shi et al., 2015; Stenni et al., 2017; Werner et al., 
2018), global ocean (McGregor et al., 2015), quasi-hemispheric (Neukom et al., 2014; Schneider et al., 2015; 
Anchukaitis et al., 2017), and global (Tardif et al., 2019)  temperature reconstructions, and new regional 
proxy data syntheses (Lüning et al., 2019a,b) have been published, extending back 1-2 kyr. In addition, a 
major new global compilation of multiproxy, annually resolved paleo-temperature records for the CE 
(PAGES 2k Consortium, 2017) has been analysed using a variety of statistical methods for reconstructing 
temperature (PAGES 2k Consortium, 2019). The median of the multi-method GMST reconstruction from 
this synthesis (Figure 2.11a) generally agrees with the AR5 assessment, while affording more robust 
estimates of the following major features of GMST during the CE: (1) an overall millennial-scale cooling 
trend of –0.18 [–0.28 to 0.00] °C kyr<sup>–1</sup> prior to 1850; (2) a multi-centennial period of relatively low 
temperature beginning around the 15th century, with GMST averaging –0.03 [–0.30 to 0.06] °C between 
1450 and 1850 relative to 1850–1900; (3) the warmest multi-decadal period occurring most recently; and (4) 
the rate of warming during the second half of the 20th century (from instrumental data) exceeding the 99th 
percentile of all 51-year trends over the past 2 kyr. Moreover, the new proxy data compilation shows that the 
warming of the 20th century was more spatially uniform than any other century-scale temperature change of 
the CE (medium confidence) (Neukom et al., 2019). A new independent temperature reconstruction 
extending back to 1580 is based on an expanded database of subsurface borehole temperature profiles, along 
with refined methods for inverse modelling (Cuesta-Valero et al., 2021). The borehole data, converted to 
GMST based on the modelled relation between changes in land versus sea surface temperature outlined 
previously, indicate that average GMST for 1600–1650 was 0.12°C colder than 1850–1900, which is similar 
to the PAGES 2k reconstruction (0.09°C colder), although both estimates are associated with relatively large 
uncertainties (0.8°C (95% range) and 0.5°C (90% range), respectively).  
 
To conclude, following approximately 6 ka, GMST generally decreased, culminating in the coldest multi-
century interval of the post-glacial period (since 8 ka), which occurred between around 1450 and 1850 (high 
confidence). This multi-millennial cooling trend was reversed in the mid-19th century. Since around 1950, 
GMST has increased at an observed rate unprecedented for any 50-year period in at least the last 2000 years 
(medium confidence).

<boxref>Cross-Chapter Box 2.3</boxref>

#### 2.3.1.1.3  Temperatures during the instrumental period – surface 
AR5 concluded that it was certain that GMST had increased since the late 19th century. Total warming in 
GMST was assessed as 0.85 [0.65 to 1.06] °C over 1880–2012, whilst the change from 1850–1900 to 2003–
2012 was assessed at 0.78 [0.72 to 0.85] °C, and from 1850–1900 to 1986–2005 at 0.61 [0.55 to 0.67] °C. 
SR1.5 reported warming of GMST from 1850–1900 to 2006–2015 of 0.87°C, with an 1880–2012 trend of 
0.86°C and an 1880–2015 trend of 0.92°C. SRCCL concluded that since the pre-industrial period, surface air 
temperature over land areas has risen nearly twice as much as the global mean surface temperature (high 
confidence).  
 
Since AR5, there have been substantial improvements in the availability of instrumental archive data both 
over the ocean and on land. A new version of the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Dataset 
(ICOADS Release 3.0, Freeman et al., 2017) comprises over 450 million in situ marine reports and 
incorporates newly digitised data, increasing coverage in data sparse regions and times (e.g. polar oceans and 
World War I). The International Surface Temperature Initiative released a much improved collection of 
fundamental land surface air temperature records (Rennie et al., 2014) comprising more than 35,000 station 
records. These advances, both of which have substantially improved spatial coverage, have reduced 
uncertainties in assessments of both land and marine data.  
 
##### Marine domain 
  
For SST analyses, three products – HadSST4 (1850–present, Kennedy et al., 2019), ERSSTv5 (1850–
present, Huang et al., 2017) and COBE SST2 (1880–present, (Hirahara et al., 2014) – now have bias 
adjustments applied throughout the record. The new SST datasets account for two major issues previously 
identified in AR5: that globally averaged buoy SSTs are about 0.12°C cooler than ship-based SSTs (Huang 
et al., 2015; Kennedy et al., 2011), and that SSTs from ship engine room intakes may have biases for 
individual ships depending upon the sensor set-up (Kent & Kaplan, 2006) but have an overall warm bias 
when globally aggregated (Kennedy et al., 2019). The first issue primarily affects data since 1990, when 
buoys began to increasingly contribute to the observation network (Woodruff et al., 2011), and the second 
issue has its largest effect from the 1940s to the 1970s. From the standpoint of uncertainty, ERSSTv4 (Liu 
W. et al., 2015a; Huang et al., 2016) and subsequent versions (Huang et al., 2017), and HadSST4 have 
estimates presented as ensembles that sample parametric uncertainty. Comparisons between these 
independently-derived analyses and the assessed uncertainties (Kennedy, 2014; Kent et al., 2017) show 
unambiguously that global mean SST increased since the start of the 20th century, a conclusion that is 
insensitive to the method used to treat gaps in data coverage (Kennedy, 2014).  
 
A number of recent studies also corroborate important components of the SST record (Cowtan et al., 2018; 
Hausfather et al., 2017; Kennedy et al., 2019; Kent et al., 2017). In particular, ATSR SST satellite retrievals 
(Merchant et al., 2012; Berry et al., 2018), the near-surface records from hydrographical profiles (Gouretski 
et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2018), and coastal observations (Cowtan et al., 2018) have all been shown to be 
broadly consistent with the homogenized SST analyses. Hausfather et al. (2017) also confirmed the new 
estimate of the rate of warming seen in ERSSTv4 since the late 1990s through comparison with independent 
SST data sources such as Argo floats and satellite retrievals. Nevertheless, dataset differences remain in the 
mid-20th century when there were major, poorly-documented, changes in instrumentation and observational 
practices (Kent et al., 2017), particularly during World War II, when ship observations were limited and 
disproportionately originated from US naval sources (Thompson et al., 2008). Kennedy et al. (2019) also 
identify differences between the new HadSST4 dataset and other SST datasets in the 1980s and 1990s, 
indicating that some level of structural uncertainty remains during this period, whilst Chan et al. (2019) and 
Davis et al. (2019) document residual uncertainties in the early and later 20th century records respectively.  
 
Historically, SST has been used as a basis for global temperature assessment on the premise that the less 
variable SST data provides a better estimate of marine temperature changes than marine air temperature 
(MAT) (Kent & Kennedy, 2021). However, MAT products are used to adjust SST biases in the NOAA SST 
product because they are assessed to be more homogeneous (Huang et al., 2017). Observational datasets 
exist for night-marine air temperature (NMAT) (e.g. (Cornes et al., 2020; Junod & Christy, 2019; Rayner et 
al., 2020) and there are methods to adjust daytime MATs (Berry et al., 2004), but there is to date no regularly 
updated dataset which combines MAT with temperatures over land. MAT datasets are more sparse in recent 
decades than SST datasets as marine datasets have become increasingly dependent on drifting buoys 
(Centurioni et al., 2019) which generally measure SST but not MAT, and there are almost no recent winter 
MAT data south of 40°S (Swart et al., 2019). However, the situation reverses in the 19th Century with a 
greater prevalence of MAT than SST measurements available in the ICOADS data repository (Freeman et 
al., 2017, 2019; Kent & Kennedy, 2021). 
 
##### Land domain 
 
The GHCNMv4 dataset (Menne et al., 2018) includes many more land stations than GHCNMv3, arising 
from the databank efforts of Rennie et al. (2014), and calculates a 100-member parametric uncertainty 
ensemble drawing upon the benchmarking analysis of Williams et al. (2012), as well as accounting for 
sampling effects. A new version of the CRUTEM dataset (CRUTEMv5, Osborn et al., 2021) has increased 
data completeness and additional quality control measures. A new global land dataset, the China Land 
Surface Air Temperature (CLSAT) dataset (Xu et al., 2018) has higher network density in some regions 
(particularly Asia) than previously existing datasets. Global trends derived from CLSAT are generally 
consistent with those derived from other land datasets through 2014 (Xu et al., 2018). 
 
AR5 identified diurnal temperature range (DTR) as a substantial knowledge gap. The most recent analysis of 
Thorne et al. (2016a,b) compared a broad range of gridded estimates of change in DTR, including a new 
estimate derived from the ISTI databank release using the pairwise homogenization algorithm used to create 
GHCNMv4, and estimates derived from the Vose et al. (2005), HadEX2 (Donat et al., 2013a), HadGHCND 
(Donat et al., 2013a), GHCNDEX (Donat et al., 2013b), Berkeley Earth (Rohde et al., 2013), and CRU TS 
(Harris et al., 2014). The analysis highlighted substantial ambiguity in pre-1950 estimates arising from 
sparse data availability. After 1950 estimates agreed that DTR had decreased globally with most of that 
decrease occurring over the period 1960–1980. A subsequent DTR analysis using CLSAT further confirmed 
this behaviour (Sun et al., 2018).  
 
No recent literature has emerged to alter the AR5 finding that it is unlikely that any uncorrected effects from 
urbanization (Box 10.3), or from changes in land use or land cover (Section 2.2.7), have raised global Land 
Surface Air Temperature (LSAT) trends by more than 10%, although larger signals have been identified in 
some specific regions, especially rapidly urbanizing areas such as eastern China (Li Y. et al., 2013; Liao et 
al., 2017; Shi et al., 2019). There is also no clear indication that site-specific data homogeneity issues have 
had any significant impact on global trends since the early 20th century; there is more uncertainty in the 19th 
century, mainly arising from a lack of standardization of instrument shelters, which has been largely 
accounted for in data from central Europe (Jones et al., 2012), but less so elsewhere.  
 
##### Combined data products 
 
At the time of AR5 a limitation of conventional datasets was the lack of coverage, especially in high 
latitudes, which although recognised as an issue (Simmons et al., 2010a) had not been addressed in most 
products. Interpolation involves the statistical imputation of values across regions with limited data and can 
add both systematic and random uncertainties (Lenssen et al., 2019). Cowtan and Way (2014) applied a 
kriging-based method to extend existing datasets to polar regions, while Kadow et al. (2020a) used an 
artificial intelligence-based method, and Vaccaro et al. (2021) used gaussian random Markov fields, for the 
same purpose, although only Kadow et al. (2020) uses the most recent generation of datasets as its base. The 
Berkeley Earth merged product (Rohde & Hausfather, 2020), HadCRUT5 (Morice et al., 2021) and NOAA 
GlobalTemp - Interim (Vose et al., 2021) all include interpolation over reasonable distances across data 
sparse regions which results in quasi-global estimates from the late 1950s when continuous Antarctic 
observations commenced. Interpolated datasets with substantial coverage of high latitudes show generally 
stronger warming of GMST than those with limited data in polar regions (Vose et al., 2021), and their strong 
warming at high northern latitudes is consistent with independent estimates from reanalyses (Simmons et al., 
2017; Lenssen et al., 2019) and satellites (Cowtan and Way, 2014). Given the spatial scales of surface 
temperature variations and the verification of the methods, it is extremely likely that interpolation results in a 
less-biased estimate of the actual global temperature change than ignoring regions with limited or no data. 
 
In total there are five conventional datasets which meet spatial coverage requirements and draw from the 
most recent generation of SST analyses, four of which have sufficient data in the 1850–1900 period to allow 
an assessment of changes from that baseline (Table 2.3). A fifth dataset is added to the assessment for 
changes over land areas. Datasets share SST and LSAT data products and in several cases differ solely in the 
post-processing interpolation applied meaning that there are far fewer methodological degrees of freedom 
than implied by a straight count of the number of available estimates. 
 
<tableref>2.3</tableref> 
 
Estimates of GMST have also benefitted from improved estimation of parametric uncertainties. New 
versions of three long-standing products from NASA GISTEMP v4 (Lenssen et al., 2019), NOAA 
GlobalTempv5 (Huang et al., 2019) and HadCRUT5 (Morice et al., 2021) are all now available as ensemble 
estimates. These ensembles each account for a variety of systematic and random uncertainty effects in 
slightly different ways, giving broadly similar results, which are incorporated into the present assessment, 
with the total uncertainty generally declining up until the mid-20th century as data coverage improves. 
 
Another significant development has been the incorporation of reanalysis products (Section 1.5.2) into 
operational monitoring of GSAT. It was reported in AR5 that various reanalyses were broadly consistent 
with conventional surface datasets in the representation of trends since the mid-20th century. Since that time, 
Simmons et al. (2017) found that the ERA-Interim (Dee et al., 2011) and JRA-55 (Kobayashi et al., 2015) 
reanalyses continued to be consistent, over the last 20 years, with those surface datasets which fully 
represented the polar regions. GSAT trends from ERA5 reanalysis (Hersbach et al., 2020) are also broadly 
consistent with GMST trends from conventional surface datasets. However, the MERRA-2 reanalysis 
(Gelaro et al., 2017) GSAT spuriously cooled sharply relative to ERA-Interim and JRA-55 in about 2007 
(Funk et al., 2019). Since the early 2000s, analyses of surface temperature, from which near-surface 
temperature may be derived, have also been available from various satellites (Famiglietti et al., 2018; 
Prakash et al., 2018; Susskind et al., 2019), which have the potential to improve assessments of temperature 
changes over data-sparse regions.  
 
Most land areas in the extratropical NH have warmed faster than the GMST average over both the 1900–
2020 and 1980–2020 periods (Figure 2.11b), although at more regional scales, particularly in data sparse 
regions, considerable uncertainty is introduced by sometimes large differences in trends between different 
LSAT datasets (Rao et al., 2018). Temperatures averaged over land areas globally have warmed by 1.59 
[1.34 to 1.83] °C from 1850–1900 to 2011–2020, substantially higher than the SST warming of 0.88 [0.68 to 
1.01] °C. The four conventional surface temperature products which meet all criteria to be included in the 
final assessment (Table 2.4) agree that each of the last four decades has consecutively been the warmest 
globally since the beginning of their respective records (Figure 2.11c, Table 2.4). Each of the six years 2015 
to 2020 has very likely been at least 0.9°C warmer than the 1850–1900 average. 
 
<tableref>2.4</tableref>

To conclude, from 1850–1900 to 1995–2014, GMST increased by 0.85 [0.69 to 0.95] °C, and to the most 
recent decade (2011–2020) by 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20] °C. Each of the last four decades has in turn been warmer 
than any decade that preceded it since 1850. Temperatures have increased faster over land than over the 
oceans since 1850–1900, with warming to 2011–2020 of 1.59 [1.34 to 1.83] °C versus 0.88 [0.68 to 1.01] 
°C, respectively. 
 
 
### 2.3.1.2  Temperatures during the instrumental period – free atmosphere 
 
AR5 reported that it was virtually certain that tropospheric temperatures have risen, and stratospheric 
temperatures fallen, since the mid-20th century, but that assessments of the rate of change and its vertical 
structure had only medium confidence in the NH extratropics and low confidence elsewhere. In particular 
there was low confidence in the vertical structure of temperature trends in the upper tropical troposphere. 
 
#### 2.3.1.2.1  Dataset developments 
There have been updated radiosonde estimates from the University of Vienna (RAOBCORE and RICH;  
Haimberger et al., 2012) and a new dataset from the State University of New York (SUNY, (Zhou et al., 
2020). There are new versions of AMSU products from the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAHv6.0; 
Spencer et al., 2017) and Remote Sensing Systems (RSSv4.0; Mears and Wentz, 2017). These updates have 
led to convergence in the lower stratosphere layer (Maycock et al., 2018); in particular, the move to 
UAHv6.0 has addressed homogeneity issues identified by Seidel et al. (2016), although residual differences 
remain (Christy et al., 2018). Reanalyses products had identified limitations near the 300 hPa level where the 
contribution of aircraft observations has increased rapidly in recent years (Dee et al., 2011; Gelaro et al., 
2017), leading to identified biases (Dee and Uppala, 2009), that have been addressed in ERA5 (Hersbach et 
al., 2020). Modern reanalyses are generally well aligned with radiosonde and satellite observations in the 
middle and lower troposphere and lower stratosphere. A new operational mid- and upper-stratospheric 
dataset (STAR) has been developed by Zou & Qian (2016), merging the previous 1979–2006 SSU dataset 
(Zou et al., 2014) with a dataset from 1998 onwards drawn from relevant AMSU channels (Wang & Zou, 
2014). Further stratospheric satellite-based datasets from various combinations of satellites have been 
developed by McLandress et al. (2015) and Randel et al. (2016). 
 
New assessments of free-atmosphere temperature are available through radio occultation (RO) and 
Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) products which begin in the early 2000s (Section 1.5.1.1). Global 
Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-RO datasets have been compared against AMSU data records, finding 
almost identical trends (Khaykin et al., 2017). Comparison of RO with collocated radiosondes, Vaisala 
RS90/92 and GCOS Reference Upper Air Network data (RS92-GDP; Dirksen et al., 2014), show very good 
correspondence with global annual mean differences of less than 0.2°C in the upper troposphere and lower 
stratosphere. Radiosonde daytime radiation biases were identified at higher altitudes (Ho et al., 2017; 
Ladstädter et al., 2015). The stability of RO makes this data a useful comparator for AMSU (Chen & Zou, 
2014) and radiosondes (Ho et al., 2017; Tradowsky et al., 2017), as well as anchoring post-2006 reanalyses 
datasets and improving their consistency in the lower and middle stratosphere (Ho et al., 2020; Long et al., 
2017). The effective vertical resolution of RO measurements in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere 
was found to be up to 100 m at the tropical tropopause (Zeng et al., 2019a), which is favourable for resolving 
atmospheric variability (Scherllin-Pirscher et al., 2012; Stocker et al., 2019; Wilhelmsen et al., 2018). 
Temperature trends in RO products are most consistent with each other and with other observations between 
8 km and 25 km (Ho et al., 2012; Steiner et al., 2013, 2020a). The uncertainty increases above 25 km for the 
early RO period, for which data are based on the single-satellite CHAMP mission, but data at higher 
altitudes become more reliable for later missions based on advanced receivers (Steiner et al., 2020a), along 
with the application of corrections for ionospheric effects (Danzer et al., 2020). The uncertainty due to the 
changing number of observations is reduced by correcting for the sampling uncertainty in RO climatological 
fields (e.g., Scherllin-Pirscher et al., 2011). For AIRS, thus far, stability of the instrument has been 
constrained to less than 0.03 C per decade for selected window channels in a comparison to SSTs measured 
by ocean buoys (Aumann et al., 2019). Trends were inter-compared with trends in RO data and reanalysis 
data to assess systematic uncertainties (Leroy et al., 2018). 

#### 2.3.1.2.2  Assessment of trends 
Warming has continued in the lower troposphere according to all radiosonde, reanalyses and satellite 
datasets, with a rate over 1980–2019 similar to surface warming rates (Table 2.5; c.f. Table 2.4). 
Radiosonde-based products generally show greater warming rates for 1980–2019 than satellite-based 
products and reanalyses. They also extend further back to the 1950s and trends since quasi-global coverage 
around 1960 also show warming (Table 2.5). Trends in RO and AIRS data, supported by radiosonde 
datasets, exhibit a warming trend in most of the mid- to upper- troposphere at all non-polar latitudes over 
2002–2019. These also exhibit faster warming rates in the tropics in the upper troposphere than those 
observed at or near the surface (Figure 2.12); with the lowermost stratosphere also warming while above it is 
cooling. There is some spread between different data types in the tropics near the 15 km level, although these 
differences are reduced to near zero if a subset of radiosonde data, using only high-quality instruments, is 
used (Steiner et al., 2020b). AMSU tropical middle troposphere data also show that warming rates are near 
or above those in the lower troposphere, but they are measuring much broader layers which greatly 
complicates interpretation (Steiner et al., 2020b).  
 
Temperatures averaged through the full lower stratosphere (roughly 10–25 km) have decreased over 1980–
2019 in all data products, with the bulk of the decrease prior to 2000. The decrease holds even if the 
influence of the El Chichon (1982) and Pinatubo (1991) volcanic eruptions on the trend, found by Steiner et 
al. (2020b) to have increased the 1979–2018 cooling trend by 0.06°C per decade, is removed. Most datasets 
show no significant or only marginally significant trends over 2000–2019, and the results of Philipona et al. 
(2018) show weak increases over 2000–2015 in the very lowermost stratosphere sampled by radiosondes. 
 
The STAR dataset shows cooling in the middle and upper stratosphere with a trend of –0.56°C ± 0.16°C per  
decade for the mid-stratosphere and –0.62°C ± 0.29°C per decade for the upper stratosphere over 1980–
2019, although both cooling rates have slowed substantially since the mid-1990s. The overall post-1980 
trend is reduced in magnitude by about 0.10°C per decade at both levels if the influences of the El Chichon 
and Pinatubo eruptions, and the solar cycle, are removed (Zou and Qian, 2016). The results obtained by 
McLandress et al. (2015) for 1980–2012, Randel et al. (2016) for 1979–2015, and Maycock et al. (2018) for 
1979-2016 are broadly consistent with this. 
 
A rise in the tropopause height of 40 to 120 m per decade between 1981 and 2015 was determined from both 
radiosonde and reanalysis datasets (Xian and Homeyer, 2018). Local studies (e.g. Tang et al., 2017; Chen X. 
et al., 2019) found stronger trends in some regions near the subtropical jet linked to tropical expansion 
(Section 2.3.1.4.1). Whilst Seidel and Randel (2006) found that the tropopause height was more closely 
coupled with temperatures in the stratosphere than those in the troposphere, it is not yet clear whether the 
rate of increase in tropopause height has experienced a similar recent slowdown to that of the cooling of the 
lower stratosphere, as short-period trends are typically inconclusive due to significant natural variability 
(Scherllin-Pirscher et al., 2020). RO data (Gao P. et al., 2015) indicate little change in tropopause height over 
the short period from 2006 to 2014, but a warming below the tropopause is observed over 2002 to 2019 
(Figure 2.12).  
 
In summary, the troposphere has warmed since the mid-20th century. There is medium confidence that 
temperatures in the tropical upper troposphere have warmed faster than those at the surface since 2001, but 
low confidence in changes prior to 2001. It is virtually certain that the lower stratosphere has cooled since 
the mid-20th century. However, most datasets show that lower stratospheric temperatures have stabilized 
since the mid-1990s with no significant change over the last 20 years. It is likely that middle and upper 
stratospheric temperatures have decreased since 1980, but there is low confidence in the magnitude. It is 
virtually certain that the tropopause height has risen over 1980–2019 but there is low confidence in the 
magnitude of this rise, or whether the rate of change has reduced commensurate with stabilized lower 
stratospheric temperatures.

### 2.3.1.3  Global hydrological cycle 
 
This section focuses on large-scale changes in a subset of components of the hydrological cycle (Cross-
Chapter Box 2.2). Chapter 8 undertakes a holistic assessment of changes in the hydrological cycle 
integrating observations, modelling and theoretical understanding, while Chapter 11 assesses hydrological 
cycle extremes such as droughts and floods.  
 
 
#### 2.3.1.3.1  Paleo perspective of the global hydrological cycle 
AR5 assessed large-scale indicators of terrestrial paleo hydroclimate, including as part of its assessment of 
paleo floods and droughts, but did not assess proxy evidence for paleo hydroclimate indicators over 
continental and larger scales. The paleoclimate evidence assessed in AR5 was broadly consistent with global 
hydroclimate scaling with temperature: warmer periods were wetter (e.g., the Pliocene; increased 
precipitation) with colder periods being drier (e.g., the LGM; decreased precipitation).  
 
Substantial limitations exist in reconstructing the global hydrological cycle prior to the Quaternary, 
particularly during the Eocene, due to the lack of high-resolution proxy records and their sparsity. Spatial 
heterogeneity complicates identification of wetting and drying signals during the PETM and the EECO, with 
paleo data and model simulations suggesting an intensified global hydrological cycle (Carmichael et al., 
2016, 2017; Hyland et al., 2017; West et al., 2020), in particular an increased specific humidity (Winnick et 
al., 2015; van Dijk et al., 2020). Conditions wetter than present were inferred for the MPWP (Cross Chapter 
Box 2.4), with intensified Asian monsoons (An et al., 2015) and with nevertheless drier conditions over 
tropical and subtropical SH locations (Pontes et al., 2020). A new global reconstruction of hydroclimate 
proxies for the LIG points to stronger boreal precipitation compared to 1850–1900 over high latitudes and 
especially over monsoon areas, with a more heterogeneous signal for the SH (Scussolini et al., 2019). This 
heterogeneity is also present in the tropics, characterized by large zonal differences in precipitation change 
due to the variations in the intensity of Walker circulation (section 2.3.1.4.1). Available records indicate 
reduced global vegetation cover and abundant atmospheric dust deposition during the LGM (increased 
aridity), particularly over the tropics and high latitudes (Lamy et al., 2014; Újvári et al., 2017). This agrees 
with models and moisture-sensitive proxies, suggesting an overall decrease in global precipitation during the 
LGM relative to recent decades, albeit with regional-scale heterogeneity (Cao et al., 2019). Despite lower 
global precipitation amounts, research since AR5 has identified a wetting of mid-latitudes during the LGM 
(Putnam and Broecker, 2017; Lowry and Morrill, 2018; Morrill et al., 2018), thereby complicating the 
characterization of the LGM as a relatively “dry” period. Low evaporation rates and increased top-soil 
moisture during the LGM may have contributed to elevated levels of large closed-basin lakes located in the 
30°–45° latitudinal belts (Putnam and Broecker, 2017; Scheff et al., 2017), such as the southwest US (e.g. 
Ibarra et al., 2018), southern Australia (Fitzsimmons et al., 2015; Petherick et al., 2013; Sniderman et al., 
2019) and Patagonia (e.g. Quade & Kaplan, 2017).  
 
New analyses suggest that during the Holocene, the NH mid-latitudes became increasingly wet, in phase 
with the strength of the latitudinal temperature and insolation gradients (Shuman and Marsicek, 2016; 
Routson et al., 2019). Nevertheless, there was also considerable spatial heterogeneity and variability on 
centennial to millennial timescales (Liefert & Shuman, 2020; Newby et al., 2014; Shuman & Marsicek, 
2016; Zhang H. et al., 2018). The NH tropics and many regions of the SH deep tropics experienced wetting 
up until the early to mid-Holocene but drying thereafter (Muñoz et al., 2017; Nash et al., 2016; Quade et al., 
2018; Shanahan et al., 2015). Evidence for the SH is limited, with a wetting trend during the Holocene in low 
latitudes of South America (Kanner et al., 2013; Mollier-Vogel et al., 2013) and parts of the African tropics 
(Schefuß et al., 2011; Chevalier and Chase, 2015) but a drying tendency over southern Australia and New 
Zealand (Barr et al., 2019; van den Bos et al., 2018) and South America (Moreno et al., 2018; Quade & 
Kaplan, 2017). 
 
For the CE, new proxy records have led to the creation of continental drought atlases (Cook et al., 2015; 
Morales et al., 2020; Palmer et al., 2015; Stahle et al., 2016) and millennial reanalyses (Steiger et al., 2018; 
Tardif et al., 2019). These reconstructions highlighted the occurrence of multi-decadal regional mega-
droughts in the NH before 1600 CE, particularly during 800–1200 CE, with a predominance of wet periods 
after 1700 CE (Cook et al., 2015; Rodysill et al., 2018; Shuman et al., 2018). In the SH, much of South 
America and the African tropics experienced a reduction of precipitation during 900–1200 CE and a wetting 
peak during 1500–1800 CE (Campos et al., 2019; Fletcher et al., 2018; Lüning et al., 2018; Nash et al., 2016; 
Tierney et al., 2015), with an opposite pattern in southern subtropical Africa (Lüning et al., 2018; 
Woodborne et al., 2015). Large multidecadal variability was documented over Australia and New Zealand 
during the 800–1300 CE period, followed by a well-defined wet period during 1500–1800 CE (Barr et al., 
2014; Evans et al, 2019).  
 
To summarise, since AR5 there has been considerable progress in detecting the variations of the global 
hydrological cycle prior to the instrumental period. There are indications from multiple sources of a wetting 
trend during the Holocene, particularly for the NH and parts of the SH tropics (medium confidence). 
Hydroclimate during the CE is dominated by regional variability, generally precluding definitive statements 
on changes at continental and larger scales, with a general reduction of mega-drought occurrences over the 
last about 500 years (medium confidence). Availability of proxy data for assessing Holocene hydroclimate 
variability is biased towards the NH, with medium evidence but low agreement for the assessment of SH 
changes.  
 
 
#### 2.3.1.3.2  Surface humidity 
AR5 reported very likely widespread increases in near-surface air specific humidity since the 1970s, abating 
from around 2000 to 2012 (medium confidence). This abatement resulted in a recent decline in relative 
humidity over the land. 
 
Near surface humidity has been monitored using in situ data (e.g. NOCSv2.0; Berry and Kent, 2011), 
satellite-derived estimations (e.g. HOAPS3, Liman et al., 2018; J-OFURO3, Tomita et al., 2019), global 
gridded products such as HadISDH (Willett et al., 2014; 2020), and reanalyses (e.g. ERA5, JRA-55 and 
20CRv3). In situ based humidity products suffer from uncertainties over poorly sampled regions particularly 
in the SH (Berry & Kent, 2011; Kent et al., 2014; Willett et al., 2014). There is general consensus in the 
inter-annual variability and sign of trends implying high confidence in increasing specific humidity since the 
1970s and decreasing relative humidity since 2000, particularly over land (Simmons et al., 2010; Willett et 
al., 2014; 2020). Since 2012, specific humidity over land and ocean has remained well above the 1973–2019 
average and reached record or near-record values (Figure 2.13b), with the strong 2015–2016 El Niño event 
boosting surface moisture levels (Byrne and O’Gorman, 2018). The abatement from around 2000 to 2012 
reported in AR5 has not persisted. This is consistent with increases in total column water vapour (Section 
2.3.1.3.3) and a resumption of rapid warming in surface temperatures (Section 2.3.1.1.3). The global 
averaged relative humidity however has remained depressed since 2000 (Figure 2.13d) (Dunn et al., 2017; 
Simmons et al., 2010; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2018; Willett et al., 2014; 2020).  
 
Since 1973, increases in specific humidity have been widespread and significant across the majority of the 
land and ocean regions where observations are available (Figure 2.13a). In contrast, trends in relative 
humidity show distinct spatial patterns with generally increasing trends over the higher latitudes and the 
tropics and generally decreasing trends over the sub-tropics and mid-latitudes, particularly over land areas 
(Figure 2.13c). Near-surface specific humidity over the oceans has increased since the 1970s according to 
several in situ, satellite and reanalysis data records (Kent et al., 2014; Robertson et al., 2020; Willett et al., 
2020). According to the HadISDH product, increases in specific humidity and decreases in relative humidity 
are significant particularly over the NH mid-latitudes (Figure 2.13a,c). Poor data coverage over the SH south 
of 20°S does not allow for the robust assessment of trends. Sources of uncertainty include the initial 
measurement accuracy, homogenisation over land, observational height at ships and instrument bias 
adjustment over ocean, and sparse spatio-temporal sampling (Prytherch et al., 2015; Roberts et al., 2019; 
Willett et al., 2020). 
 
In summary, observations since the 1970s show a very likely increase in near surface specific humidity over 
both land and oceans. A very likely decrease in relative humidity has occurred over much of the global land 
area since 2000, particularly over mid-latitude regions of the NH, with increases at northern high latitudes.  
 
<figref>2.13</figref> 
 
#### 2.3.1.3.3  Total column water vapour 
AR5 concluded that total column water vapour (TCWV) very likely increased since the 1970s, at a rate that 
was overall consistent with the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship (about 7% per C) given the observed 
increase in atmospheric temperature. 
 
Records prior to the instigation of quasi-global coverage by radiosondes require the use of statistical 
relationships to infer TCWV from historical SST observations or the evaluation of centennial-scale 
reanalysis products (Smith and Arkin, 2015). These approaches reveal two periods of positive trends, one 
during 1910–1940 and the other from 1975 onwards (Zhang et al., 2013; Mieruch et al., 2014; Shi et al., 
2018), concurrent with periods of positive SST trends (Figure 2.11). Potential sources of errors in the SST-
based estimation of TCWV include both uncertainties in historical SST and uncertainties in the parameters 
that define the relationship between the variables (Smith & Arkin, 2015). Trends based on 20CRv2c, ERA-
20C and ERA-20CM indicate an increase in TCWV over much of the global ocean since the beginning of 
the 20th century, particularly over the tropics (Bordi et al., 2015; Poli et al., 2016; Smith & Arkin, 2015). 
TCWV trends estimated since the middle of the 20th century from radiosonde observations show significant 
increases over North America and large portions of Eurasia, while decreases are restricted to Australia, 
Eastern Asia and the Mediterranean region (Zhang Y. et al., 2018). Overall, there is a significant increase in 
TCWV over global land areas since 1979 (Chen & Liu, 2016). 
 
Since the late 1970s a range of satellite missions permit a quasi-global assessment of TCWV. Several 
satellite products provide water vapour retrievals based upon distinct spectral domains, in addition to 
products from radiosondes, reanalyses and GNSS radio occultation. The GEWEX Water Vapour Assessment 
(G-VAP) provided an intercomparison of several TCWV data records, with global coverage but limited 
timespan (Schröder et al., 2018). The various global products generally exhibit a positive trend since 1979 
(Figure 2.14) (Allan et al., 2014; Mieruch et al., 2014; Schröder et al., 2016; Wang X.L. et al., 2016a), most 
evident over the tropics (Chen & Liu, 2016; Gu & Adler, 2013; Mears et al., 2018; Salamalikis et al., 2021; 
Wang R. & Liu, 2020). The existence of apparent breakpoints in several products, which are generally 
coincident with changes in the observing system, lead to trend estimates that are not in line with theoretical 
expectations imposed by the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship (Schröder et al., 2019a), although other factors 
such as regional moisture divergence/convergence could account for the observed TCWV-temperature 
scaling. Substantial potential inhomogeneities affect trend estimates based on satellite, reanalysis and merged 
products in particular over Central Africa, the Sahara and central South America (Schröder et al., 2016, 
2019; Wang et al., X.L. 2016). Moreover, data gaps in observations from ground-based GNSS receivers and 
radiosondes lead to low confidence in TCWV estimation in these regions.  

<figref>2.14</figref>
 
In summary, positive trends in global total column water vapour are very likely since 1979 when globally 
representative direct observations began, although uncertainties associated with changes in the observing 
system imply medium confidence in estimation of the trend magnitudes. Low confidence in longer-term 
trends arises from uncertainties in the SST-TCWV relationship and current centennial scale reanalyses, 
particularly during the first half of the 20th century. 
 
 
#### 2.3.1.3.4  Global precipitation 
AR5 concluded that there was low confidence in precipitation change averaged over global land areas prior 
to 1950, and medium confidence thereafter with no significant global trends. There was a likely overall 
increase in precipitation in the well-sampled NH mid-latitudes, with high confidence after 1951.  
 
In situ precipitation records over land extend back for centuries in a few locations, and to the early to mid-
20th century quasi-globally. Datasets differ in their input data, completeness of records, period covered, and 
the gridding procedures which, given spatial clustering and the small spatial scales of precipitation, results in 
differences in global and regional estimates of precipitation changes (Nogueira, 2020; Sun Q. et al., 2018). 
The spatial variability of observed long-term trends (1901–2019) based on GPCC V2020 and CRU TS 4.04 
(Figure 2.15a,b) indicates significant increases in precipitation mainly over eastern North America, northern 
Eurasia, southern South America and northwestern Australia. Decreases are strongest across tropical western 
and equatorial Africa and southern Asia. The temporal evolution of global annual land precipitation 
anomalies exhibits little consistency between GPCC V2020, CRU TS 4.04 and GHCNv4 datasets, especially 
prior to 1950, that is associated with limitations in data coverage (Figure 2.15c, (Gu & Adler, 2015; Shen et 
al., 2014; Wu et al., 2013). These disagreements between datasets prior to the 1950s result in differences in 
trend estimates over global land (Table 2.6). A qualitative consistency in decadal and interdecadal variations 
between the products is only observed since the 1950s, with primarily positive land precipitation anomalies 
during the 1950s, 1970s and after the 2000s (Figure 2.15c).  
 
Several satellite-based precipitation datasets improve the representation of the spatio-temporal changes since 
the late 20th century. Some of these are based exclusively on satellite data (e.g. CMORPH, Joyce et al., 
2004; GSMaP, Okamoto et al., 2005), with others being combinations of in situ observations, reanalyses and 
satellite retrievals (e.g. CMAP, Xie and Arkin, 1997; TRMM 3B43 V7, Huffman et al., 2007; PERSIANN-
CDR, Ashouri et al., 2015; CHIRPS, Funk et al., 2015; GPCP V2.3, Adler et al., 2018). These can be 
affected by systematic and random uncertainties due to inhomogeneities in the satellite-derived precipitation 
and station data and the uncertainties of blending algorithms (Hegerl et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2018a). The 
spatial coverage of these products is near-global, with available estimations formally covering 60°S–60°N 
with decreasing quality from low to high latitudes, depending on the sensors and algorithms used (Hu Q. et 
al., 2019). A detailed description of the most relevant satellite products is provided in section 10.2.1.1. 
 
Recent trends (1980–2019) for GPCC V2020, CRU TS 4.04 and GPCP V2.3 show significant increases in 
land precipitation over tropical Africa, the eastern portions of Europe and North America, central Asia and 
the Maritime Continent (Figure 2.14, d, e and f). Significant decreases are observed over central South 
America, western North America, northern Africa and the Middle East. A detailed assessment of the recent 
regional precipitation trends using the same datasets can be found in the Atlas. Global trends for 1980–2019 
show a general increase in annual precipitation over land, which is particularly marked for CRU TS 4.04 and 
GHCNv4 (Table 2.6). These changes have been accompanied by a strengthening of precipitation seasonality 
over tropical land areas, although with broad spread between different satellite-based (GPCP, 
MSWEP_V1.2, PERSIANN-CDR) and in situ gridded datasets (GPCC, CRU TS) (Chou et al., 2013; Li X.  
et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2020). Increasing trends since 1980, in contrast to longer-term declining trends since 
1901, are particularly evident over much of Africa, while more widespread negative trends were observed 
over much of southern South America in the more recent period (Knutson and Zeng, 2018) (Atlas 7.2). A 
faster recent increase in precipitation over global land is inferred comparing the precipitation trends over 
1960–2019 with 1980–2019 (Table 2.6). Over the global ocean, the comparison between precipitation 
datasets is compromised by the different measurement periods, as well as the spatial coverage of the 
available products (Adler et al., 2017; Jaber & Abu-Allaban, 2020; Nguyen et al., 2018; Nogueira, 2020), 
limiting the ability to assess the sign and magnitude of precipitation trends. The GPCPv2.3 database (Adler 
et al., 2017, 2018) exhibits an increase of 2.94 mm yr<sup>–1</sup> per decade over 1980–2019, principally due to the 
trends over the Indian ocean and in the tropical western Pacific (Figure 2.15f). The regional patterns of 
recent trends are consistent with the documented increase in precipitation over tropical wet regions and the 
decrease over dry areas, estimated through GPCP v2.2 data (Kao et al., 2017; Liu & Allan, 2013; Polson & 
Hegerl, 2017; Trammell et al., 2015). 
 
<figref>2.15</figref>
<tableref>2.6</tableref> 
 
In summary, globally averaged land precipitation has likely increased since the middle of the 20th century 
(medium confidence), with low confidence in trends prior to 1950. A faster increase in global land 
precipitation was observed since the 1980s (medium confidence), with large interannual variability and 
regional heterogeneity. Over the global ocean there is low confidence in the estimates of precipitation trends, 
linked to uncertainties in satellite retrievals, merging procedures and limited in situ observations. 
 
 
#### 2.3.1.3.5  Precipitation minus Evaporation 
AR5 concluded that the pattern of precipitation minus evaporation (P-E) over the ocean had been enhanced 
since the 1950s (medium confidence). Saline surface waters had become saltier, while the relatively fresh 
surface waters had become fresher. The inferred changes in P-E were consistent with the observed increased 
TCWV, although uncertainties in the available products prevented identifying robust trends. 
 
Estimating global-scale trends in P-E using direct observations alone is challenging due to limited 
evaporation measurements and inhomogeneities in satellite-derived precipitation and evaporation datasets 
(Hegerl et al., 2015; López et al., 2017). Hence, the assessment of global P-E trends is generally performed 
using reanalyses, although changes in the observing system imply considerable uncertainty (Skliris et al., 
2014a). Since the second half of the 20th century, several reanalyses and observational datasets have shown 
increases in P-E over global land, although 75% of land areas exhibit no significant changes and both 
internal variability and observational uncertainty are substantial (Greve et al., 2014; Robertson et al., 2016). 
The recently released ERA5 (Hersbach et al., 2020) showed improvements in the representation of tropical 
precipitation, although it overestimates global precipitation trends in comparison to ERA-Interim and GPCP 
(Nogueira, 2020), and suffers from temporal changes in the annual balance between precipitation and 
evaporation (Hersbach et al., 2020). The spatial pattern of P-E trends over 1980–2019 (Figure 2.16a) are 
largely consistent with the trends in the GPCP v2.3 precipitation dataset (Figure 2.15f, Section 2.3.1.3.4) and 
agrees in sign with the trends from other reanalyses such as JRA-55 and MERRA-2 (Yu L. et al., 2020).  
 
A variety of reanalysis products exhibit diverse temporal evolutions of P-E (Figure 2.16b-d). Globally 
MERRA-2, ERA20C and ERA20CM exhibit little change whereas JRA-55, ERA5 and 20CRv3 all imply 
long-term changes (Figure 2.16d). A potential limitation in estimating P-E from some reanalysis products is 
readily apparent when considering the temporal evolution of global P-E from CFSR and MERRA (Figure 
2.16d) which both exhibit strong discontinuities over the global ocean in the late 1990s. Over global land as 
a whole, precipitation exceeds evaporation (P-E > 0) for all the reanalysis products (Figure 2.16c), with 
decreasing trends in P-E for ERA5 and JRA-55 and increasing trends for MERRA-2 and CFSR. The P-E 
over the global ocean is negative (evaporation exceeding precipitation) for most reanalyses (Figure 2.16d), 
with declining trends in ERA5 and MERRA-2 dominated by trends in evaporation (Bosilovich et al., 2017; 
Hersbach et al., 2020) (Figure 2.16d). The recent increase in ocean evaporation was also documented for 
several reanalyses (Craig et al., 2017) and in satellite data (Andersson et al., 2011; Robertson et al., 2014), 
although with considerable differences between available estimates (Chandanpurkar et al., 2017, Yu L. et al., 
2020). An alternative indirect approach to estimate P-E changes is based on near-surface ocean salinity 
(Section 2.3.3.2), which is partially driven by the freshwater flux at the ocean surface. The near-surface 
salinity trends are more spatially coherent compared to those revealed by P-E estimates from reanalyses, 
with an intensification of the water cycle over oceans, especially in subtropical regions (Yu L. et al., 2020, 
Durack et al., 2012; Skliris et al., 2014). However, the precise rate of water cycle intensification implied by 
salinity trends is sensitive to methodological choices (e.g., Skliris et al., 2016; Zika et al., 2018). 
 
<figref>2.16</figref>
 
In conclusion, observational uncertainty yields low confidence in globally averaged trends in P-E over the 
20th century, with a spatial pattern dominated by precipitation changes over land and by evaporation 
increases over the ocean. Different reanalyses disagree on the sign of long-term changes in the global mean 
P-E. 
 
 
#### 2.3.1.3.6  Streamflow 
AR5 concluded that there was low confidence in a positive trend in global river discharge during the 20th 
century. It noted that many of the largest rivers with long term streamflow records have been impacted by 
non-climatic human influences such as dam construction or land-use change. 
 
River discharge is monitored widely, although gaps remain at a subcontinental scale over central Asia and 
Africa (Wei et al., 2020). Substantial recent efforts have been made to generate new global streamflow 
datasets, consolidating observations from many stream gauges to create streamflow indices (Do et al., 2018; 
Gudmundsson et al., 2018) and gridded products using neural networks (Barbarossa et al., 2018) or 
combinations between observations and reanalyses (Suzuki et al., 2018; Ghiggi et al., 2019).  
 
Human intervention on river discharge linked to increases in evapotranspiration and some reduction of intra-
annual streamflow variability (Jaramillo and Destouni, 2015, Chai et al., 2020) might affect the detection of 
trends in extreme daily streamflow events (Do et al., 2017; Gudmundsson et al., 2019). However, these 
activities have a minor impact on annual streamflow compared to climate variations (Dai et al., 2009; 
Alkama et al., 2013). Available global studies post-1950 generally concur that there have been more rivers 
experiencing decreases than increases in runoff (Do et al., 2017; Gudmundsson et al., 2019; X. Shi et al., 
2019; Su et al., 2018). Most of the rivers have not experienced statistically significant changes in streamflow, 
and when globally aggregated there is no significant change (Dai and Zhao, 2017). Global streamflow 
variability is strongly modulated by ENSO and PDV, with below-normal global streamflow as a response to 
El Niño events and vice-versa during La Niña episodes (Dai, 2016; Kim, 2019; Liang et al., 2016). The 
response of streamflow to changes in precipitation associated with ENSO and PDV has heterogeneous 
regional patterns at subcontinental scales (Section 8.3.2.9.1). No significant trends are found for reanalysis-
based discharge estimates over 1993 to 2015 (Chandanpurkar et al., 2017). Uncertainties in global 
streamflow trends arise predominantly from changes in instrumentation, gauge restoration, recalibration of 
rating curves, flow regulation or channel engineering (Alkama et al., 2011; Gudmundsson et al., 2018; 
Ghiggi et al., 2019).  
 
In summary, the sign of global streamflow trends remains uncertain, with slightly more globally gauged 
rivers experiencing significantly decreasing flows than significantly increasing flows since the 1950s (low 
confidence). 
 
 
### 2.3.1.4  Atmospheric circulation 
 
This section focuses on large-scale changes in a subset of components of the atmospheric circulation (Cross-
Chapter Box 2.2). Chapter 8 assesses large-scale as well as regional aspects of circulation components and 
their impact on the hydrological cycle, while Chapter 11 assesses the association of circulation changes and 
variability with extreme events. 
 
 
#### 2.3.1.4.1 The Hadley and Walker circulations

AR5 reported low confidence in trends in the strength of the Hadley circulation (HC) and the Walker 
circulation (WC) due to uncertainties in available reanalysis datasets and the large interannual-to-decadal 
variability of associated circulation patterns. However, AR5 indicated a likely widening of the tropical belt 
since the 1970s, albeit with large uncertainty in the magnitude of this change. There was high confidence that 
the post-1990s strengthening trends of the Pacific WC reversed its weakening observed from the mid-19th 
century to the 1990s. 
 
Paleo reconstructions of rainfall and trade winds extending over the last 100 kyr show an intensification of 
the NH HC concurrently with a weakening of the SH HC and a southward shift of the inter tropical 
convergence zone (ITCZ) during Heinrich stadials (Deplazes et al., 2013; McGee et al., 2018; Stríkis et al., 
2018; Wendt et al., 2019). An intensification of the HC associated with conditions similar to La Niña 
(northward migrations of both the ITCZ and the SH westerlies) was found in reconstructions for the MH 
(McGee et al., 2014; Mollier-Vogel et al., 2019). Changes in insolation from the mid to late Holocene 
favoured a southward migration in the position of the ITCZ and the descending branch of the HC in the NH, 
approaching its current width and position (Wirth et al., 2013a; Thatcher et al., 2020). Tree ring chronologies 
from the NH mid-latitudes over the last 800 years show that the northern edge of the HC tended to migrate 
southward during positive phases of ENSO and PDV, with northward shifts during negative phases (Alfaro-
Sánchez et al., 2018). Between 1400 and 1850 CE the HC over both hemispheres and the ITCZ were 
displaced southward, consistent with occurrence of drought conditions in several NH regions (Alfaro-
Sánchez et al., 2018; Burn and Palmer, 2014; Flores-Aqueveque et al., 2020; Lechleitner et al., 2017; Wirth 
et al., 2013). Moreover, several proxy records showed not only inter-hemispheric shifts in the ITCZ but a 
contraction of the tropical belt during 1400–1850 CE, which followed an expansion during 950–1250 CE 
(Denniston et al., 2016; Griffiths et al., 2016). 
 
From centennial-scale reanalyses, Liu et al. (2012) and D’Agostino and Lionello (2017) found divergent 
results on HC extent over the last 150 years, although with unanimity upon an intensification of the SH HC. 
A substantial discrepancy between HC characteristics in centennial-scale reanalyses and in ERA-Interim 
(D’Agostino and Lionello, 2017) since 1979 yields significant questions regarding their ability to capture 
changes in HC behaviour. Taken together with the existence of apparent non-climatic artefacts in the dataset 
(Nguyen et al., 2015), this implies low confidence in changes in the extent and intensity of HC derived from 
centennial-scale reanalyses. However, using multiple observational datasets and centennial-scale reanalyses, 
Bronnimann et al. (2015) identified a southward shift in the NH HC edge from 1945 to 1980 of about 0.25° 
latitude per decade, consistent with observed changes in global land monsoon precipitation (Section 
2.3.1.4.2). 
 
Since AR5 several studies based upon a range of metrics and different reanalyses products have suggested 
that the annual mean HC extent has shifted poleward at an approximate rate of 0.1°–0.5° latitude per decade 
over the last about 40 years (Allen & Kovilakam, 2017; Davis & Birner, 2017; Grise et al., 2018; Staten et 
al., 2020; Staten et al., 2018; Studholme & Gulev, 2018; Grise & Davis, 2020). The observed widening of 
the annual mean HC, revealed by a variety of metrics, is primarily due to poleward shift of the NH HC. 
There have been stronger upward trends in the NH extent of HC after 1992 (Figure 2.17a). The estimated 
magnitude of the recent changes based on modern-era reanalyses is not as large as that in AR5, due to 
apparent biases in older-generation reanalyses (Grise et al., 2019). Moreover, large interannual variability 
leads to uncertainties in estimates of long-term changes (Nguyen et al., 2013, Garfinkel et al., 2015b; 
Seviour et al., 2018; Staten et al., 2018), particularly for the NH given its zonal asymmetries (Staten et al., 
2020; Wang et al., 2020). These large-scale features of the HC based on reanalyses agree with estimates 
revealed from the Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive (IGRA) during 1979–2012 (Lucas & Nguyen, 
2015; Mathew et al., 2016). Recent trends based on reanalyses indicate a larger seasonal widening in the HC 
for summer and autumn in each hemisphere, although the magnitude of changes in HC extent is strongly 
dependent on dataset and metrics used (Grise et al., 2018; Hu Y. et al., 2018; Staten et al., 2018). The shifts 
in the HC position were accompanied by a narrowing ITCZ over the Atlantic and Pacific basins, with no 
significant change in its location and increases in the precipitation intensity (Byrne et al., 2018). 
 
Trends in the HC intensity since 1979 differ between reanalyses, although there is a tendency toward HC 
intensification (Figure 2.17b) (Nguyen et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014; D’Agostino and Lionello, 2017; 
Huang et al., 2019), which is more marked in the NH than the SH (Studholme and Gulev, 2018). However, 
the ability of reanalyses to represent the HC strength has been questioned due to inaccurate representation of 
latent heating distribution, which is directly related to tropical convection and influences the HC dynamics 
(Chemke and Polvani, 2019; Mathew and Kumar, 2019). 
 
<figref>2.17</figref>
 
Paleo evidence during the LGM indicates a weaker WC over the Indian Ocean (Windler et al., 2019, 
DiNezio et al., 2018), with a stronger Pacific WC (DiNezio and Tierney, 2013). During the Holocene, a 
transition from a strong WC located more westward during the Early-to-Mid Holocene towards a weak and 
eastward shifted WC during the late Holocene was inferred from proxy records from the Pacific Warm Pool 
and South-eastern Asia (Barr et al., 2019; Dang et al., 2020; Griffiths et al., 2020), in concurrence with 
changes in ENSO activity (section 2.4.2). Reconstructions for the CE showed weakened WC during 1000–
1250 and since 1850, with an intensified circulation during 1500–1850 CE (Deng et al., 2017; Xu et al., 
2016).  
 
Considering instrumental records, there is considerable interdecadal variability in the strength of the WC, 
resulting in time-period dependent magnitude and even sign of trends (Bordbar et al., 2017; Carilli et al., 
2015; Hou et al., 2018), with some studies reporting weakening over the 20th century (e.g. Liu et al., 2019; 
Power and Kociuba, 2011), while others reported strengthening (Li Z. et al., 2020), particularly over the last 
30-40 years (e.g. Hu et al., 2013; L’Heureux et al., 2013, Yim et al., 2017). Based on estimation of changes 
in mid-tropospheric velocity from changes in observed cloud cover, Bellomo and Clement (2015) suggest a 
weakening and eastward shift of the WC over 1920–2010, however the robustness of this signal is 
questionable due to high uncertainty in the ship reported cloud data records used before 1954. Using 
centennial-scale 20CR reanalysis Tseng et al. (2019) showed that the vertical westerly wind shear over the 
western Pacific does not indicate any long-term change during 1900–1980, but shows a marked increase 
since the 1980s that is not present in ERA-Interim and JRA-55, again calling into question the ability of 
centennial-scale reanalyses to capture tropical circulation changes. Recent strengthening together with a 
westward shift of the WC (Bayr et al., 2014; Ma & Zhou, 2016) was identified across several reanalysis 
products and observational datasets, and using different metrics for quantifying WC. Nevertheless, satellite 
observations of precipitation and analyses of upper tropospheric humidity suggest substantially weaker 
strengthening of the WC than implied by reanalyses (Chung et al., 2019). This recent strengthening in the 
WC is associated with enhanced precipitation in the tropical western Pacific, anomalous westerlies in the 
upper troposphere, strengthened downwelling in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, and anomalous 
surface easterlies in the western and central tropical Pacific (Dong and Lu, 2013; Choi et al., 2016, 
McGregor et al., 2014). Positive trends in sea level pressure over the eastern Pacific and concurrent negative 
trends over the Indonesian region result in a pattern implying a shift towards a La Niña-like WC regime, 
with strengthening of the Pacific Trade Winds mainly over 1979–2012 (England et al., 2014; L’Heureux et 
al., 2013; Sohn et al., 2016; Zhao & Allen, 2019). Seasonal assessment of the WC showed significant 
changes in the vertical westerly wind shear over the Pacific during the austral summer and autumn implying 
a strengthening (Clem et al., 2017). 
 
In summary, there has been a likely widening of the Hadley circulation since the 1980s, mostly due to its 
extension in the NH, although there is only medium confidence in the extent of the changes. This has been 
accompanied by a strengthening of the Hadley circulation, particularly in the NH (medium confidence). 
There is low confidence in the estimation of long-term trends in the strength of the Walker circulation, which 
are time period dependent and subject to dataset uncertainties. Trends since 1980 are better characterised and 
consistent with a very likely strengthening that resembles a La Niña-like Walker circulation and a westward 
shift of the Walker circulation, although with medium confidence in the magnitude of the changes, arising 
from the differences between satellite observations and reanalysis products. 
 
 
#### 2.3.1.4.2  Global monsoon changes 
AR5 reported a weakening of the global monsoon (GM) circulation as well as a decrease of global land 
monsoon rainfall over the second half of the 20th century. Nevertheless, there was low confidence in the 
observed circulation trends due to uncertainties in reanalysis products and in the definition of the monsoon 
area. From a paleo perspective, AR5 only assessed regional monsoon changes. 
 
New research based on high-resolution proxies reinforces previous findings on the influence of orbital cycles 
on GM variability on millennial time scales. The intensity of the monsoon systems is generally out of phase 
between hemispheres, being associated with the precession cycle (21–23 kyr) (An et al., 2015; Seth et al., 
2019; Wang P.X. et al., 2017), with intensified NH monsoon systems during precession minima (Toucanne 
et al., 2015; Wagner et al., 2019). The eccentricity forcing (about 100 kyr cycle) shows stronger GM during 
interglacial periods (An et al., 2015; Mohtadi et al., 2016; Wang P. X. et al., 2014; 2017). Changes in 
obliquity (about 41 kyr cycle) modify the strength of monsoon systems, with increased summer monsoon 
rainfall when obliquity is maximal (Liu Yi et al., 2015; Mohtadi et al., 2016). Millennial scale variability in 
GM during the LDT was also linked to the occurrences of Heinrich stadials, resulting in weakened NH 
monsoons and intensified SH monsoons (An et al., 2015; Margari et al., 2020; Wang P.X. et al., 2017).  
 
An intensification of the NH monsoons in the early to mid-Holocene with increased precipitation and 
regional expansions of rainfall areas identified through a variety of proxy records is shown by Biasutti et al., 
(2018) and  Wang P.X. et al. (2017). The response for the SH monsoons during this period indicates a 
weakening in both summer and winter precipitation (Sachs et al., 2018; Wang P.X. et al., 2014; 2017). A 
decline in GM precipitation and a retraction of the northern fringes of monsoon areas was inferred from the 
mid-Holocene onwards, with some regions experiencing wetter conditions during the mid to late Holocene 
compared with present and a strengthening of the SH monsoons (Sachs et al., 2018; Wang P.X. et al., 2014; 
2017). For the CE, GM reconstructions exhibit inter-hemispheric contrast during the period 950–1250 CE, 
with intensified NH monsoons and weakened SH monsoons, and the opposite pattern during 1400–1850 CE 
(An et al., 2015; Wang P. X. et al., 2014). 
 
Direct observations highlight that the GM land precipitation, particularly over the NH, experienced a slight 
increase from 1900 through the early 1950s, followed by an overall decrease from the 1950s to the 1980s, 
and then an increase to present (Huang X. et al., 2019; Kitoh et al., 2013; Wang B. et al., 2018; 2020). This 
highlights the existence of multidecadal variations in the NH monsoon circulation patterns and precipitation 
intensity (Monerie et al., 2019; Wang B. et al., 2013; Wang P.X. et al., 2014; 2017). An overall increase in 
monsoon precipitation during extended boreal summer (JJAS) over the NH since 1979 is revealed by GPCP 
(Deng et al., 2018; Han et al., 2019) and CMAP for 1980–2010 (Jiang et al. 2016). SH summer monsoon 
behaviour is dominated by strong interannual variability and large regional differences (Deng et al., 2018;  
Han et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2016; Kamae et al., 2017; Kitoh et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2014), with no 
significant trends reported by GPCP and CMAP (Deng et al., 2018). Uncertainty predominantly arises from 
the observed increase in tropical precipitation seasonality (Feng et al., 2013) and the estimation of GM 
precipitation over the ocean areas, leading to a large apparent spread across datasets (Kitoh et al., 2013b; 
Kamae et al., 2017).  
 
In summary, observed trends during the last century indicate that the GM precipitation decline reported in 
AR5 has reversed since the 1980s, with a likely increase mainly due to a significant positive trend in the NH 
summer monsoon precipitation (medium confidence). However, GM precipitation has exhibited large multi-
decadal variability over the last century, creating low confidence in the existence of centennial-length trends 
in the instrumental record. Proxy reconstructions show a likely NH monsoons weakening since the mid-
Holocene, with opposite behaviour for the SH monsoons.  
 
 
#### 2.3.1.4.3  Extratropical jets, storm tracks, and blocking 
AR5 reported a likely poleward shift of storm tracks and jet streams since the 1970s from different datasets, 
variables and approaches. These trends were consistent with the HC widening and the poleward shifting of 
the circulation features since the 1970s. There was low confidence in any large-scale change in blocking.  
 
Proxy records consistent with modelling results imply a southward shift of the storm tracks over the North 
Atlantic during the LGM (Raible et al., 2021). A variety of proxies are available for the changes in the 
position of the extratropical jets / westerlies during the Holocene. Recent syntheses of moisture-sensitive 
proxy records indicate drier-than-present conditions over mid-latitudes of western North America (Hermann 
et al., 2018; Liefert and Shuman, 2020) during the MH, which together with a weakened Aleutian Low 
(Bailey et al., 2018) implies that the winter North Pacific jetstream was shifted northward. A synthesis of 
lines of evidence from the SH indicates that the westerly winds were stronger over 14–5 ka, followed by 
regional asymmetry after 5 ka (Fletcher & Moreno, 2012). There is no consensus on the shifts of the SH 
westerlies with some studies implying poleward migrations (Lamy et al., 2010; Voigt et al., 2015; Turney et 
al., 2017; Anderson et al., 2018) and others suggesting an equatorward shift (Kaplan et al., 2016) in the MH. 

During 950–1400 CE, hydroclimate indicators suggest a northward shift of Pacific storm tracks over North 
America (McCabe-Glynn et al., 2013; Steinman et al., 2014) which was comparable in magnitude to that 
over 1979–2015 (Wang et al., 2017). Storm tracks over the North Atlantic-European sector shifted 
northward as indicated by multi-proxy indicators over the North Atlantic (Wirth et al., 2013; Orme et al., 
2017) and Mediterranean (Roberts et al., 2012). Reconstructed westerly winds in the SH suggest a poleward 
shift (Goodwin et al., 2014; Koffman et al., 2014; Lamy et al., 2010; Moreno et al., 2018; Schimpf et al., 
2011), with latitudinal change comparable to that during recent decades (Swart and Fyfe, 2012; Manney and 
Hegglin, 2018).  
 
Multiple reanalyses show that since 1979 the subtropical jet wind speeds have generally increased in winter 
and decreased in summer in both hemispheres, but the trends are regionally dependent (Pena-Ortiz et al., 
2013; Manney and Hegglin, 2018; Lee et al., 2019). Over NH mid-latitudes, the summer zonal wind speeds 
have weakened in the mid-troposphere (Francis and Vavrus, 2012; Coumou et al., 2014, 2015; Haimberger 
and Mayer, 2017). Meanwhile there are indications of enhanced jetstream meandering in boreal autumn at 
the hemispheric scale (Francis and Vavrus, 2015; Di Capua and Coumou, 2016), whereas the regional 
arrangement of meandering depends on the background atmospheric state (Cohen et al., 2020). These 
meandering trends, however, are sensitive to the metrics used (Cattiaux et al., 2016; Hassanzadeh et al., 
2014; Screen & Simmonds, 2013; Vavrus, 2018). Hypothesised links to Arctic warming are assessed in 
Cross-Chapter Box 10.1.  
 
Multiple reanalyses and radiosonde observations show an increasing number of extratropical cyclones over 
the NH since the 1950s (Chang & Yau, 2016; Wang X. L. et al., 2016). The positive trends are generally 
consistent among reanalyses since 1979, though with considerable spread (Tilinina et al., 2013; Wang X. L. 
et al., 2016). In recent decades the number of deep extratropical cyclones has increased over the SH (Reboita 
et al., 2015; Wang X. L. et al., 2016) (Section 8.3.2.8.1, Figure 8.12), while the number of deep cyclones has 
decreased in the NH in both winter and summer (Neu et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017, Chang et al., 2016; 
Coumou et al., 2015; Gertler & O’Gorman, 2019). The regional changes for different intensity extratropical 
cyclones are assessed in Section 8.3.2.8.1. The assessment of trends is complicated by strong interannual-
decadal variability, sensitivity to dataset choice and resolution (Tilinina et al., 2013; Lucas et al., 2014; 
Wang et al., 2016; Pepler et al., 2018; Rohrer et al., 2018) and cyclone identification / tracking methods (Neu 
et al., 2013; Grieger et al., 2018). Thus there is overall low confidence for recent changes in global 
extratropical storm tracks.  
 
A consistent poleward shift of the tropospheric extratropical jets since 1979 is reported by multiple 
reanalyses (Davis and Rosenlof, 2012; Davis and Birner, 2013; Pena-Ortiz et al., 2013; Manney and Hegglin, 
2018) (Figure 2.18), and radiosonde winds (Allen et al., 2012). This is generally consistent with the earlier 
reported shifts retrieved from satellite temperature observations (Fu and Lin, 2011; Davis and Rosenlof, 
2012). After the 1960s the magnitude of meridional shifts in extratropical jets over both the North Atlantic 
and North Pacific in August is enhanced compared to multi-century variability (Trouet et al., 2018). Despite 
some regional differences (Ma & Zhang, 2018; Melamed-Turkish et al., 2018; Norris et al., 2016; Wang J. et 
al., 2017a; Woollings et al., 2014; Xue & Zhang, 2018), overall poleward deflection of storm tracks in boreal 
winter over both the North Atlantic and the North Pacific was identified during 1979–2010 (Tilinina et al., 
2013). Over the SH extra-tropics there is a similarly robust poleward shift in the polar jet since 1979 (Pena-
Ortiz et al., 2013; Manney and Hegglin, 2018; WMO, 2018), although after 2000 the December-January-
February (DJF) tendency to poleward shift of the SH jet stream position ceased (Banerjee et al., 2020). The 
general poleward movement in midlatitude jet streams (Lucas et al., 2014) is consistent with the expansion 
of the tropical circulation (Section 2.3.1.4.1). The changes of extratropical jets and westerlies are also related 
to the annular modes of variability (Section 2.4, Annex IV). 
 
Robust trends in blocking have only been found in certain regions and specific seasons during recent 
decades. Increases in blocking frequency have occurred over low-latitude regions in the North Atlantic in 
boreal winter (Davini et al., 2012), the South Atlantic in austral summer (Dennison et al., 2016) and the 
southern Indian Ocean in austral spring (Schemm, 2018). Over the subpolar North Atlantic sustained periods 
of positive Greenland blocking were identified during 1870–1900 and from the late 1990s to 2015 (Hanna et 
al., 2015). Further analysis of association of Greenland blocking with the NAM is provided in Section 
2.4.1.1. Meanwhile, a reduced blocking frequency has been found over winter in Siberia (Davini et al., 2012) 
and the southwestern Pacific in austral spring (Schemm, 2018). Over Eastern European Russia and Western 
Siberia (40–100E) a tendency towards longer blocking events was reported by Luo et al. (2016) for 2000–
2013 and by Tyrlis et al. (2020) for 1979–2017. Inter-annual variance in the number of blocking events over 
the SH (Oliveira et al., 2014) and North Atlantic (Kim & Ha, 2015) has enhanced. Blocking events and their 
trends are sensitive to choice of datasets, calculation periods and methods (Barnes et al., 2014; Cheung et al., 
2013; Kononova & Lupo, 2020; Pepler et al., 2018; Rohrer et al., 2018; Woollings et al., 2018b). As a result, 
hemispheric and global trends in blocking frequency have overall low confidence.  
 
In summary, the total number of extratropical cyclones has likely increased since the 1980s in the NH (low 
confidence), but with fewer deep cyclones particularly in summer. The number of strong extratropical 
cyclones has likely increased in the SH (medium confidence). The extratropical jets and cyclone tracks have 
likely been shifting poleward in both hemispheres since the 1980s with marked seasonality in trends (medium 
confidence). There is low confidence in shifting of extratropical jets in the NH during the mid-Holocene and 
over 950–1400 CE to latitudes that likely were similar to those since 1979. There is low confidence in 
observed global-scale changes in the occurrence of blocking events.

#### 2.3.1.4.4  Surface wind and sea level pressure 
AR5 concluded that surface winds over land had generally weakened. The confidence for both land and 
ocean surface wind trends was low owing to uncertainties in datasets and measures used. Sea level pressure 
(SLP) was assessed to have likely decreased from 1979–2012 over the tropical Atlantic and increased over 
large regions of the Pacific and South Atlantic, but trends were sensitive to the period analysed.  
 
Terrestrial in situ wind datasets have been updated and the quality-control procedures have been improved, 
with particular attention to homogeneity and to better retaining true extreme values (Dunn et al., 2012; 2014; 
2016). Global mean land wind speed (excluding Australia) from HadISD for 1979–2018 shows a reduction 
(stilling) of 0.063 m s-1 per decade (Azorin-Molina et al., 2019). Trends are broadly insensitive to the subsets 
of stations used. Although the meteorological stations are unevenly distributed worldwide and scarce in 
South America and Africa, the majority exhibit stilling particularly in the NH (Figure 2.19). Regionally, 
strong decreasing trends are reported in central Asia and North America (–0.106 and –0.084 m s-1 per decade 
respectively) during 1979–2018 (McVicar et al., 2012; Vautard et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2018; Azorin-Molina 
et al., 2019). This stilling tendency has reversed after 2010 and the global mean surface winds have 
strengthened (Azorin-Molina et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2019), although the robustness of this reversal is 
unclear given the short period and interannual variability (Kousari et al., 2013; Kim and Paik, 2015; Azorin-
Molina et al., 2019). 
 
<figref>2.19</figref> 
 
Over the ocean, datasets demonstrate considerable disagreement in surface wind speed trends and spatial 
features (Kent et al., 2013). Global ocean surface winds from NOCv2.0 demonstrate upward trends of about 
0.11 m s-1 per decade (1979–2015) with somewhat smaller trends from WASwind for 1979–2011 (Azorin-
Molina et al., 2017, 2019). The datasets are consistent until 1998, but diverge thereafter. Both ERA5 and 
JRA-55 reanalyses show consistently increasing global marine wind speeds over 1979–2015, though 
flattening since 2000, whereas MERRA-2 agrees until 1998, but then exhibits increased variability and an 
overall decrease in the last two decades (Azorin-Molina et al., 2019). This agrees with estimates by Sharmar 
et al. (2021) showing upward ocean wind trends from 1979 to 2000 which are consistent in ERA-Interim, 
ERA5 and MERRA-2, but disagree with CFSR trends for the same period. Over 2000–2019 all reanalyses 
show diverging tendencies. An updated multiplatform satellite database (comprising data from altimeters, 
radiometers, and scatterometers) from 1985–2018 shows small increases in mean wind speed over the global 
ocean, with the largest increase observed in the Southern Ocean (Young & Ribal, 2019), consistent with 
signals in ERA-Interim, ERA5 and MERRA-2 (Sharmar et al., 2021). Overall, most products suggest 
positive trends over the Southern Ocean, western North Atlantic and the tropical eastern Pacific since the 
early 1980s.  
 
The modern era reanalyses exhibit SLP increases over the SH subtropics with stronger increases in austral 
winter over 1979–2018. Over the NH, SLP increased over the mid-latitude Pacific in boreal winter and 
decreased over the eastern subtropical and mid-latitude North Atlantic in boreal summer. Discrepancies in 
the low-frequency variations during the first half of the 20th century exist in the centennial-scale reanalysis 
products (Befort et al., 2016). Overall, modern reanalysis datasets support the AR5 conclusion that there is 
no clear signal for trends in the strength and position of the permanent and quasi-permanent pressure centres 
of action since the 1950s. Instead, they highlight multi-decadal variations. Large-scale SLP is strongly 
associated with the changes in modes of variability (Section 2.4, Annex IV). 
 
In summary, since the 1970s a worldwide weakening of surface wind has likely occurred over land, 
particularly marked in the NH, with low confidence in a recent partial recovery since around 2010. 
Differences between available wind speed estimates lead to low confidence in trends over the global ocean as 
a whole but with most estimates showing strengthening globally over 1980–2000 and over the last four 
decades in the Southern Ocean, western North Atlantic and the tropical eastern Pacific.  
 
 
#### 2.3.1.4.5  Stratospheric polar vortex and sudden warming events 
AR5 assessed changes in the polar vortices and reported a likely decrease in the lower-stratospheric 
geopotential heights over Antarctica in spring and summer at least since 1979.  
 
Multiple definitions for the polar vortex strength and sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events have been 
proposed and compared (Butler et al., 2015; Palmeiro et al., 2015; Waugh et al., 2017; Butler and Gerber, 
2018), and new techniques identifying daily vortex patterns and SSWs have been developed (Kretschmer et 
al., 2018; Mitchell et al., 2013a). Errors in reanalysis stratospheric winds were assessed and discrepancies in 
stratospheric atmospheric circulation and temperatures between reanalyses, satellites and radiosondes have 
been reported (Mitchell et al., 2013a; Duruisseau et al., 2017).  
 
The northern stratospheric polar vortex has varied seasonally and with altitude during recent decades. 
Multiple reanalysis and radiosonde datasets show that the midwinter lower stratospheric geopotential height 
(150 hPa) over the polar region north of 60N has increased significantly since the early 1980s (Bohlinger et 
al., 2014; Garfinkel et al., 2017). This signal extends to the middle and upper stratosphere. In January-
February zonal winds north of 60N at 10 hPa have been weakening (Kim et al., 2014; Kretschmer et al., 
2018). Daily atmospheric circulation patterns over the northern polar stratosphere exhibit a decreasing 
frequency of strong vortex events and commensurate increase in more-persistent weak events, which largely 
explains the observed significant weakening of the vortex during 1979–2015 (Kretschmer et al., 2018). The 
northern polar vortex has weakened in early winter but strengthened during late winter (Bohlinger et al., 
2014; Garfinkel et al., 2015a; 2017; Ivy et al., 2016; Kretschmer et al., 2018; Seviour, 2017). In the middle 
and upper stratosphere, a strengthening trend of the northern polar vortex during DJF has occurred since 
1998, contrasting the weakening trend beforehand (Hu et al., 2018). The position of the polar vortex also has 
long-term variations, exhibiting a persistent shift toward Northern Siberia and away from North America in 
February over the period 1979–2015 (Zhang J. et al., 2016, 2018). Multiple measures show similar location 
changes (Seviour, 2017).  
 
The SSW, a phenomenon of rapid stratospheric air temperature increases (sometimes by more than 50°C in 
1–2 days), is tightly associated with the reversal of upper stratospheric zonal winds, and a resulting collapse 
or substantial weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex (Butler et al., 2015; Butler and Gerber, 2018) and 
on average occurs approximately 6 times per decade in the NH winter (Charlton et al., 2007; Butler et al., 
2015). The SSW record from all modern reanalyses is very consistent. There is a higher occurrence of major 
midwinter SSWs in the 1980s and 2000s with no SSW events during 1990–1997 (Reichler et al., 2012, 
Butler et al., 2015). An assessment of multidecadal variability and change in SSW events is sensitive to both 
chosen metric and methods (Palmeiro et al., 2015). Due to the lack of assimilation of upper air data, the 
centennial-scale reanalyses do not capture SSW events, even for the most recent decades (Butler et al., 2015, 
2017) and hence cannot inform on earlier behaviour. There has been considerably less study of trends in the 
southern hemispheric stratosphere vortex strength despite the interest in the ozone hole and the likely impact 
of the southern hemispheric stratosphere vortex strength on it. The occurrence of SSW events in the SH is 
not as frequent as in the NH, with only 3 documented events in the last 40 years (Shen et al., 2020). 
 
In summary, it is likely that the northern lower stratospheric vortex has weakened since the 1980s in 
midwinter, and its location has shifted more frequently toward the Eurasian continent. The short record and 
substantial decadal variability yields low confidence in any trends in the occurrence of SSW events in the 
NH winter and such events in the SH are rare. 
 
 
## 2.3.2  Cryosphere 
 
This section focuses on large-scale changes in a subset of components of the cryosphere (Cross-Chapter Box 
2.2). Chapter 9 undertakes a holistic assessment of past and possible future changes at the process level in 
the cryosphere, including those at regional scales, integrating observations, modelling and theoretical 
understanding, while,  here in chapter 2, the focus is on past large-scale, observation-based cryospheric 
changes.  
 
 
### 2.3.2.1  Sea ice coverage and thickness 
 
#### 2.3.2.1.1  Arctic Sea Ice 
AR5 reported that the annual mean Arctic sea ice extent (SIE) very likely decreased by 3.5–4.1% per decade 
between 1979 and 2012 with the summer sea ice minimum (perennial sea ice) very likely decreasing by 9.4–
13.6% per decade. This was confirmed by SROCC reporting the strongest reductions in September (12.8 ± 
2.3% per decade; 1979–2018) and stating that these changes were likely unprecedented in at least 1 kyr 
(medium confidence). The spatial extent had decreased in all seasons, with the largest decrease for 
September (high confidence). AR5 reported also that the average winter sea ice thickness within the Arctic 
Basin had likely decreased by between 1.3 m and 2.3 m from 1980 to 2008 (high confidence), consistent with 
the decline in multi-year and perennial ice extent. SROCC stated further that it was virtually certain that 
Arctic sea ice had thinned, concurrent with a shift to younger ice. Lower sea ice volume in 2010–2012 
compared to 2003–2008 was documented in AR5 (medium confidence). There was high confidence that, 
where the sea ice thickness had decreased, the sea ice drift speed had increased.  
 
Proxy records are used in combination with modelling to assess Arctic paleo sea-ice conditions to the extent 
possible. For the Pliocene, limited proxy evidence of a reduced sea-ice cover compared to ‘modern’ winter 
conditions (Knies et al., 2014; Clotten et al., 2018) and model simulations of a largely ice-free Arctic Ocean 
during summer (Feng et al., 2019; Howell et al., 2016; Li F. et al., 2020) imply medium confidence that the 
Arctic Ocean was seasonally ice covered. Over the LIG, sparse proxy reconstructions (Stein et al., 2017; 
Kremer et al., 2018) and proxy evidence from marine sediment (Kageyama et al., 2021) provide medium 
confidence of perennial sea-ice cover.  
 
Over the past 13 kyr proxy records suggest extensive sea ice coverage during the Younger Dryas (at the end 
of the LDT), followed by a decrease in sea ice coverage during the Early Holocene, and increasing sea ice 
coverage from the MH to the mid-1400s (De Vernal et al., 2013; Belt et al., 2015; Cabedo-Sanz et al., 2016; 
Armand et al., 2017; Belt, 2018). There is limited evidence that the Canadian Arctic had less multiyear sea 
ice during the Early Holocene than today (Spolaor et al., 2016). For more regional details on paleo arctic sea 
ice see Section 9.3.1.1.  
 
Current pan-Arctic SIE conditions (annual means and late summer) are unprecedented since at least 1850 
(Brennan et al., 2020; Walsh et al., 2017; 2019, Figure 2.20a), while, as reported in SROCC, there remains 
medium confidence that the current September (late summer) Arctic sea ice loss is unprecedented during the 
past 1 kyr. Sea ice charts since 1850 (Walsh et al., 2017; 2019) suggest that there was no significant trend 
before the 1990s, but the uncertainty of these estimates is large and could mask a trend, a possibility 
illustrated by Brennan et al. (2020), who found a loss of Arctic sea ice between 1910 and 1940 in an estimate 
based on a data assimilation approach. 
 
There has been a continuing decline in SIE and Arctic sea ice area (SIA) in recent years (Figure 2.20a). To 
reduce grid-geometry associated biases and uncertainties (Notz, 2014; Ivanova et al., 2016; Meier and 
Stewart, 2019) SIA is used in addition to, or instead of SIE herein (see also section 9.3.1). A record-low 
Arctic SIA since the start of the satellite era (1979) occurred in September 2012 (Figure 2.20a). Decadal SIA 
means based on the average of three different satellite products decreased from 6.23–3.76 million km2 for 
September and 14.52–13.42 million km2 for March SIA (Figure 2.20a). Initial SIA data for 2020 (OSISAF) 
are within the range of these recent decadal means or slightly below (Figure 2.20a). SIA has declined since 
1979 across the seasonal cycle (Figure 9.13). Most of this decline in SIA has occurred after 2000, and is 
superimposed by substantial interannual variability. The sharp decline in Arctic summer SIA coincides with 
earlier surface melt onset (Mortin et al., 2016; Bliss et al., 2017), later freeze-up, and thus a longer ice retreat 
and open water period (Stammerjohn et al., 2012; Parkinson, 2014; Peng et al., 2018). 
 
<figref>2.20</figref> 
 
Over the past two decades, first-year sea ice has become more dominant and the oldest multiyear ice (older 
than 4 years) which in March 1985 made up 33% of the Arctic sea ice cover, has nearly disappeared, making 
up 1.2% in March 2019 (Perovich et al., 2020). The loss of older ice is indicative of a thinning overall of ice 
cover (Tschudi et al., 2016), but also the remaining older ice has become thinner (Hansen E. et al., 2013). 
Since in situ ice thickness measurements are sparse, information about ice thickness is mainly based on 
airborne and satellite surveys. Records from a combination of different platforms show for the central and 
western Arctic Ocean (Arctic Ocean north of Canada and Alaska) negative trends since the mid-1970s 
(Kwok, 2018; Lindsay & Schweiger, 2015), with a particularly rapid decline during the 2000s, which 
coincided with a large loss of multiyear sea ice. Direct observations from 2004 and 2017 indicate a decrease 
of modal ice thickness in the Arctic Ocean north of Greenland by 0.75 m, but with little thinning between 
2014 and 2017 (Haas et al., 2017). This agrees with data based on satellite altimetry and airborne 
observations, showing no discernible thickness trend since 2010 ( Kwok & Cunningham, 2015; Kwok, 2018; 
Kwok and Kacimi, 2018) (Figure 2.21). However, sea ice thickness derived from airborne and spaceborne 
data is still subject to uncertainties imposed by snow loading. For radar altimeters, insufficient penetration of 
radar signal into the snowpack results in overestimation of ice thickness (e.g., Ricker et al., 2015; King et al., 
2018a; Nandan et al., 2020). Negative trends in ice thickness since the 1990s are also reported from the Fram 
Strait in the Greenland Sea, and north of Svalbard (Hansen E. et al., 2013; King et al., 2018; Renner et al., 
2014; Rösel et al., 2018; Spreen et al., 2020). Thickness data collected in the Fram Strait originate from ice 
exported from the interior of the Arctic Basin and are representative of a larger geographical area upstream 
in the transpolar drift. A reduction of survival rates of sea ice exported from the Siberian shelves by 15% per 
decade has interrupted the transpolar drift and affected the long-range transport of sea ice (Krumpen et al., 
2019). The thinner and on average younger ice has less resistance to dynamic forcing, resulting in a more 
dynamic ice cover (Hakkinen et al., 2008; Spreen et al., 2011; Vihma et al., 2012; Kwok et al., 2013). 
 
<figref>2.21</figref> 
 
SROCC noted the lack of continuous records of snow on sea ice. Nevertheless in recent decades, more snow 
on sea ice has been observed in the Atlantic sector in the Arctic than in the Western Arctic Ocean (Webster 
et al., 2018). Previously, Warren et al. (1999) showed that over 1954–1991 there were weak trends towards 
declining snow depth on sea ice in the Pacific sector. Recent observations indicate a substantial thinning of 
the spring snowpack in the western Arctic (Cavalieri et al., 2012; Brucker and Markus, 2013; Kurtz et al., 
2013; Laxon et al., 2013; Webster et al., 2018). In contrast, thick snow over Arctic sea ice in the Atlantic 
sector north of Svalbard (snow thickness around 0.4 m or more) has been observed in the 1970s and since the 
1990s (Rösel et al., 2018), but data are too sparse to detect trends.  
 
In summary, over 1979–2019 Arctic SIA has decreased for all months, with the strongest decrease in 
summer (very high confidence). Decadal means for SIA decreased from the first to the last decade in that 
period from 6.23 to 3.76 million km2 for September, and from 14.52 to 13.42 million km2 for March. Arctic 
sea ice has become younger, thinner and faster moving (very high confidence). Snow thickness on sea ice has 
decreased in the western Arctic Ocean (medium confidence). Since the Younger Dryas at the end of the LDT, 
proxy indicators show that Arctic sea ice has fluctuated on multiple time scales with a decrease in sea ice 
coverage during the Early Holocene and an increase from the MH to the mid-1400s. Current pan-Arctic sea 
ice coverage levels (annual mean and late summer) are unprecedentedly low since 1850 (high confidence), 
and with medium confidence for late summer for at least the past 1 kyr.  
 
 
#### 2.3.2.1.2  Antarctic Sea Ice 
AR5 reported a small but significant increase in the total annual mean Antarctic SIE that was very likely in 
the range of 1.2–1.8% per decade between 1979 and 2012 (0.13–0.20 million km2 per decade) (very high 
confidence), while SROCC reported that total Antarctic sea ice coverage exhibited no significant trend over 
the period of satellite observations (1979–2018) (high confidence). SROCC noted that a significant positive 
trend in mean annual ice cover between 1979 and 2015 had not persisted, due to three consecutive years of 
below-average ice cover (2016–2018). SROCC stated also that historical Antarctic sea ice data from 
different sources indicated a decrease in overall Antarctic sea ice cover since the early 1960s, but was too 
small to be separated from natural variability (high confidence). 
 
There is only limited evidence from predominantly regional paleo proxies for the evolution of Southern 
Ocean sea ice before the instrumental record and estimates are not available for all proxy target periods 
(Section 9.3.2). Proxies from marine sediments for intervals preceding and following the MPWP indicate 
open water conditions with less sea-ice than modern conditions (Taylor-Silva and Riesselman, 2018; Ishino 
and Suto, 2020). During the LGM, proxies indicate that summer sea ice coverage reached the polar ocean 
front (e.g., Nair et al., 2019). More recently, sea ice coverage appears to have fluctuated substantially 
throughout the Holocene (e.g., for the western Amundsen Sea, Lamping et al., 2020). At the beginning of the 
CE, regional summer sea ice coverage in the north-western Ross Sea was lower than today (Tesi et al., 
2020). Crosta et al. (2021) suggest, based on different proxies, four different phases with 7–10 months 
periods of sea ice occurrence per year in the Antarctic region off Adelie Land during the CE, where each 
phase was several hundred years long.  
 
More recent sea ice reconstructions are based on diverse sources including whaling records (De La Mare, 
1997, 2009; Cotté and Guinet, 2007), old ship logbooks (Ackley et al., 2003; Edinburgh and Day, 2016), and 
ice core records (Curran et al., 2003; Abram et al., 2010; Sinclair et al., 2014), amongst other methods (e.g. 
Murphy et al., 2014). These reconstructions, in combination with recent satellite-based observations indicate: 
i) a decrease in summer SIE across all Antarctic sectors since the early- to mid-20th century; ii) a decrease in 
winter SIE in the East Antarctic, and Amundsen-Bellingshausen Seas sectors starting in the 1960s; and iii) 
small fluctuations in winter SIE in the Weddell Sea over the 20th century (Hobbs et al., 2016a,b). There are 
also ice-core indications that the pronounced Ross Sea increase dates back to the mid-1960s (Sinclair et al., 
2014; Thomas & Abram, 2016). While there is reasonable broad-scale concurrence across these estimates, 
the uncertainties are large, there is considerable interannual variability, and reconstructions require further 
validation (Hobbs et al., 2016a,b). New reconstructions (Thomas et al., 2019) from Antarctic land ice cores 
show that SIE in the Ross Sea had increased between 1900 and 1990, while the Bellingshausen Sea had 
experienced a decline in SIE; this dipole pattern is consistent with satellite-based observations from 1979 to 
2019 (Parkinson, 2019), but the recent rate of change then has been larger. Records of Antarctic SIE for the 
late 19th and early 20th centuries (Edinburgh and Day, 2016), show SIE comparable with the satellite era, 
although with marked spatial heterogeneity (e.g., Thomas et al., 2019). 
 
Early Nimbus satellite visible and infrared imagery from the 1960s (Meier et al., 2013; Gallaher et al., 2014) 
indicate higher overall SIE compared to 1979–2013 (Hobbs et al., 2016a,b), but with large uncertainties and 
poorly quantified biases (NA SEM, 2017). The continuous satellite passive-microwave record shows that 
there was a modest increase in overall Antarctic SIA of 2.5% ± 0.2% per decade (1 standard error over 
1979–2015 (Comiso et al., 2017). For overall ice coverage and for this period, positive long-term trends were 
most pronounced during austral autumn advance (Maksym, 2019), being moderate in summer and winter, 
and lowest in spring (Comiso et al., 2017; Hobbs et al., 2016a,b; Holland, 2014; Turner et al., 2015). Since 
2014, overall Antarctic SIE (and SIA) has exhibited major fluctuations from record-high to record-low 
satellite era extents (Comiso et al., 2017; Massonnet et al., 2015; Parkinson, 2019; Reid, and Massom, 2015; 
Reid et al., 2015). After setting record-high extents each September from 2012 through 2014, Antarctic SIE 
(and SIA) dipped rapidly in mid-2016 and remained predominantly below average through 2019 (Reid et al., 
2020). For the most recent decade of observations (2010–2019), the decadal means of three SIA products 
(Figure 2.20b) were 2.17 million km2 for February and 15.75 million km2 for September, respectively. The 
corresponding levels for the means for the first decade of recordings (1979–1988) were 2.04 million km2 for 
February and 15.39 million km2 for September indicating little overall change. Initial SIA data for 2020 
(OSISAF) show SIA for September above, and for February slightly below the recent decadal means (Fig. 
2.20b). The 2020 September level (OSISAF) remains below the levels observed over 2012–2014. 
 
In summary, Antarctic sea ice has experienced both increases and decreases in SIA over 1979–2019, and 
substantively lower levels since 2016, with only minor differences between decadal means of SIA for the 
first (for February 2.04 million km2, for September 15.39 million km2) and last decades (for February 2.17 
million km2, for September 15.75 million km2) of satellite observations (high confidence). There remains low 
confidence in all aspects of Antarctic sea ice prior to the satellite era owing to a paucity of records that are 
highly regional in nature and often seemingly contradictory. 
 
 
### 2.3.2.2  Terrestrial snow cover 
 
AR5 concluded that snow cover extent (SCE) had decreased in the NH, especially in spring (very high 
confidence). For 1967–2012, the largest change was in June and March-April SCE very likely declined. No 
trends were identified for the SH due to limited records and large variability. SROCC concluded with high 
confidence that Arctic June SCE declined between 1967 and 2018 and in nearly all mountain regions, snow 
cover declined in recent decades. 
 
Analysis of the combined in situ observations (Brown, 2002) and the multi-observation product (Mudryk et 
al. 2020) indicates that since 1922, April SCE in the NH has declined by 0.29 million km2 per decade, with 
significant interannual variability (Figure 2.22) and regional differences (Section 9.5.3.1). The limited pre-
satellite era data does not allow for a similar assessment for the entire spring-summer period. Assessment of 
SCE trends in the NH since 1978 indicates that for the October to February period there is substantial 
uncertainty in trends with the sign dependent on the observational product. Analysis using the NOAA 
Climate Data Record shows an increase in October to February SCE (Hernández-Henríquez et al., 2015; 
Kunkel et al., 2016) while analyses based on satellite borne optical sensors (Hori et al., 2017) or multi-
observation products (Mudryk et al., 2020) show a negative trend for all seasons (section 9.5.3.1, Figure 
9.23). The greatest declines in SCE have occurred during boreal spring and summer, although the estimated 
magnitude is dataset dependent (Rupp et al., 2013; Estilow et al., 2015; Bokhorst et al., 2016; Thackeray et 
al., 2016; Connolly et al., 2019).  
 
<figref>2.22</figref>
 
There has been a commensurate decrease in the snow-cover duration and persistence, particularly in higher 
latitudes due to earlier spring melt and, in some cases, later autumn onset of snow cover (Chen Xiaona et al., 
2015; Derksen et al., 2015; Hammond et al., 2018; Hori et al., 2017). Arctic snow-cover duration has 
decreased by 2–4 days per decade since the 1970s (Brown et al., 2017). Significant decreases in snow-cover 
duration have been documented over western Eurasia since 1978 (Hori et al., 2017).  
 
For the NH, maximum snow depth has generally decreased since the 1960s, with more robust trends for 
North America and greater uncertainty for Eurasia (Kunkel et al., 2016). Several satellite-based passive 
microwave and other products indicate general declines in pre-melt snow water equivalent since 1981 
although there is regional and inter-dataset variability (Brown et al., 2017; Jeong et al., 2017; Marty et al., 
2017; Mortimer et al., 2020; Mudryk et al., 2020; Pulliainen et al., 2020, Section 9.5.3).  
 
In summary, substantial reductions in spring snow cover extent have occurred in the NH since 1978 (very 
high confidence) with limited evidence that this decline extends back to the early 20th century. Since 1981 
there has been a general decline in NH spring snow water equivalent (high confidence). 
 
 
### 2.3.2.3  Glacier mass 
 
AR5 concluded with high confidence that, during the Holocene, glaciers were at times smaller than at the 
end of the 20th century. AR5 stated further with very high confidence that most glaciers had been shrinking 
since the mid-1800s, and the mass loss from all glaciers worldwide very likely increased from 1970 to 2009. 
SROCC reported a globally coherent picture of continued glacier recession in recent decades (very high 
confidence) based on in situ and satellite observations of changes in glacier area, length and mass, although 
there were considerable inter-annual and regional variations. Between 2006 and 2015 the global glacier mass 
change assessed by SROCC was –278 ± 113 Gt yr<sup>–1</sup>.  
 
Two recent global reviews on glaciers over the Holocene (Solomina et al., 2015) and the past 2 kyr 
(Solomina et al., 2016) summarize the chronologies of respectively 189 and 275 glaciers. The former shows 
that glaciers retreated during the LDT and retracted to their minimum extent between 8 ka and 6 ka. Except 
for some glaciers in the SH and tropics, glaciers expanded thereafter, reaching their maximum extent beyond 
their present-day margins during the mid-1400s to late-1800s CE. With few exceptions, glacier margins 
worldwide have retreated since the 19th century, with the rate of retreat and its global character since the late 
20th century being unusual in the context of the Holocene (Solomina et al., 2016, Figure 2.23a). However, 
the areal extents of modern glaciers in most places in the NH are still larger than those of the early and/or 
middle Holocene (Solomina et al., 2015). When considering Holocene and present glaciers extents, it is 
important to account for the relatively long adjustment time of glaciers (often referred to as response time; 
Section 9.5.1.3); the majority of modern glaciers are currently out of equilibrium with current climate, even 
without further global warming (Christian et al., 2018; Marzeion et al., 2018; Mernild et al., 2013; Zekollari 
et al., 2020). The size of glaciers during other periods warmer than the Early to Mid-Holocene, such as the 
MPWP and LIG, is largely unknown because the deposits marking previous extents were in almost all cases 
over-ridden by later glaciations. For Arctic glaciers, different regional studies consistently indicate that in 
many places glaciers are now smaller than they have been in millennia (Harning et al., 2016, 2018; Lowell et 
al., 2013; Miller et al., 2013, 2017; Pendleton et al., 2019; Schweinsberg et al., 2017, 2018)  
 
New glacier outline (RGI Consortium, 2017) and glacier mass compilations (Ciracì et al., 2020; Hugonnet et 
al., 2021; Zemp et al., 2019; 2020) improve, refine and update the quantification of glacier areal and mass 
changes based on observations from in situ and remote sensing data. Observations between the 1960s and 
2019 indicate that mass loss has increased over recent decades (Figure 2.23b). The overall global glacier 
mass loss rate has increased from 240 ± 9 Gt yr<sup>–1</sup> over 2000–2009 to 290 ± 10 Gt yr<sup>–1</sup> over 2010–2019 
(Hugonnet et al., 2021), confirming that the last decade exhibits the most negative glacier mass balance since 
the beginning of the observational record. Observations are in general consistent with trends revealed by 
global glacier mass change modelling for almost the entire 20th century (1901–1990) implying an estimated 
mass loss (without uncharted glaciers (Parkes and Marzeion, 2018) and excluding peripheral glaciers of 
Greenland and Antarctica) of very likely 210 ± 90 Gt yr<sup>–1</sup> and very likely 170 ± 80 Gt yr<sup>–1</sup> for the period 
1971–2019 (Marzeion et al., 2015; Section 9.5.1 and Table 9.5).  
 
<figref>2.23</figref> 
 
In summary, there is very high confidence that, with few exceptions, glaciers worldwide have retreated since 
the second half of the 19th century, and continue to retreat. The current global character of glacier mass loss 
is highly unusual (almost all glaciers simultaneously receding) in the context of at least the last 2 kyr 
(medium confidence). Glacier mass loss rates have increased since the 1970s (high confidence). Although 
many surveyed glaciers are currently more extensive than during the MH (high confidence), they generally 
are in disequilibrium with respect to current climate conditions and hence are committed to further ice loss.  

### 2.3.2.4 Ice sheet mass and extent 
 
During glacial periods, ice sheets were more extensive and the state of knowledge on their paleo-
reconstruction can be found in recent publications (e.g. Batchelor et al., 2019; Stokes et al., 2015). This 
section focuses only on the large-scale aspects of those ice sheets, Greenland and Antarctic, that still exist 
today.  
 
#### 2.3.2.4.1  Greenland Ice Sheet 
AR5 concluded the volume of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) was reduced compared to present during 
periods of the past few million years that were globally warmer than present (high confidence). It reported 
that the GrIS had lost ice during the prior two decades (very high confidence), that the ice loss had occurred 
in several sectors, and that high rates of mass loss had both expanded to higher elevations (high confidence) 
and very likely accelerated since 1992. SROCC concluded that it was extremely likely that ice loss increased 
through the early 21st century. SROCC also found that summer melting rate had increased since the 1990s to 
a rate unprecedented over the last 350 years (very high confidence), being two to five times greater than the 
pre-industrial rates (medium confidence). 
 
Details of the history of GrIS fluctuations during warm interglacials continue to be elucidated. Oscillations 
over the past 7.5 Myr, including the Pliocene and through the glacial - interglacial cycles of the Pleistocene 
are not well-constrained, but most studies indicate that Greenland was at least partially glaciated over this 
time with extended periods when it was predominantly deglaciated (Schaefer et al., 2016, Bierman et al., 
2016). Geological evidence and modelling studies suggest periods of glacial intensification during the 
Pliocene at 4.9 Myr, 4.0 Myr, 3.6 Myr and 3.3 Myr (De Schepper et al., 2014; Bierman et al., 2016; Bachem 
et al., 2017). Retreat of the GrIS occurred during the MPWP and GrIS extent was reduced compared to today 
with some studies suggesting that the ice sheet was limited to the highest elevations (Blake-Mizen et al., 
2019; De Schepper et al., 2014; Haywood et al., 2016; Koenig et al., 2015). There is apparent glacial 
intensification following the MPWP, 2.75–2.72 Myr (Nielsen and Kuijpers, 2013; De Schepper et al., 2014; 
Blake-Mizen et al., 2019; Knutz et al., 2019). Several studies agree that during the LIG the total GrIS extent 
was likely less than present day (Section 9.4.1, Figure 9.17) with the total mass loss ranging from 0.3–6.2 m 
sea level equivalent (SLE), although timing and magnitude of this mass loss are not well constrained (Clark 
et al., 2020; Goelzer et al., 2016; Helsen et al., 2013; Sinclair et al., 2016; Stone et al., 2013; Vasskog et al., 
2015; Yau et al., 2016). During the LGM, the GrIS reached a peak ice volume greater than present (2–5 m 
SLE), as revealed by limited number of available geological records (Lecavalier et al., 2014; Simpson et al., 
2009; Batchelor et al. 2019). 
 
Recent studies of marine and lake sediments, glacier ice, and geomorphic features show that the GrIS 
retreated rapidly during the early Holocene but halted periodically, with a complex ice-margin chronology 
(Briner et al., 2016; Carlson et al., 2014; Larsen et al., 2014, 2015; Young et al., 2020; Young & Briner, 
2015). It is probable that its total volume during 8–3 ka was smaller than today (Briner et al., 2016; Larsen et 
al., 2015; Young & Briner, 2015), but uncertainties exist regarding precisely when the minimum MH extent 
and volume was reached, due to uncertainties in reconstructions. The GrIS then re-advanced reaching its 
maximum extent in most places during 1450–1850 CE, although the timing and extent of this maximum 
differed by sector (Briner et al., 2016; Larsen et al., 2015). 
 
Greenland-wide estimates of mass change based on direct observations were limited prior to 1992 at the time 
of AR5 (Kjeldsen et al., 2015). Combined records based on airborne observations, model-based estimates 
and geodetic approaches indicate an average mass loss of 75 ± 29.4 Gt yr<sup>–1</sup> for 1900–1983 (Kjeldsen et al., 
2015). Integration of proxies and modelling indicates that the last time the rate of mass loss of GrIS was 
plausibly similar to 20th century rates was during the early Holocene (Briner et al., 2020; Buizert et al., 
2018). 
 
Since AR5, a combination of remote sensing, in situ observations and modelling has provided new insights 
regarding surface processes and their contribution to recent GrIS mass changes (AMAP, 2017; Bamber et al., 
2018; IMBIE Consortium, 2020; Khan et al., 2020; Mouginot et al., 2019; van den Broeke et al., 2017). 

Estimates of total ice loss during the post-1850 period (Kjeldsen et al., 2015) and recent observations show 
that the rate of loss has increased since the beginning of the 21st century (IMBIE Consortium, 2020; Sasgen 
et al., 2020; Velicogna et al., 2020) (Figure 2.24, Section 9.4.1.1 Figure 9.17).   
 
The GrIS lost 4890 [4140–5640] Gt (SLE 13.5 [11.4–15.6] mm) of ice between 1992 and 2020 (IMBIE 
Consortium, 2020) (Figure 2.24, Section 9.4.1). The ice sheet was close to mass balance in the 1990s, but 
increases in mass loss have occurred since (Bamber et al., 2018; WCRP Global Sea Level Budget Group, 
2018; Mouginot et al., 2019; IMBIE Consortium, 2020). The rate of ice sheet (including peripheral glaciers) 
mass loss rose from 120 [70 to 170] Gt yr<sup>–1</sup> (SLE 0.33 [0.18 to 0.47] mm yr<sup>–1</sup>) in 1901–1990 to 330 [290 to 
370] Gt yr<sup>–1</sup> (SLE 0.91 [0.79 to 1.02] mm yr<sup>–1</sup>) for 2006–2018 (Section 9.4.1, Table 9.5). 
 
<figref>2.24</figref> 
 
In summary, the GrIS was smaller than present during the MPWP (medium confidence), LIG (high 
confidence) and the MH (high confidence). GrIS mass loss began following a peak volume attained during 
the 1450–1850 period and the rate of loss has increased substantially since the turn of the 21st century (high 
confidence). 
 
 
#### 2.3.2.4.2  Antarctic Ice Sheet 
AR5 reported that there was high confidence that the AIS was losing mass. The average ice mass loss from 
Antarctica was 97 [58 to 135] Gt yr<sup>–1</sup> (GMSL equivalent of 0.27 [0.16 to 0.37] mm yr<sup>–1</sup>) over 1993–2010, 
and 147 [74 to 221] Gt yr<sup>–1</sup> (0.41 [0.20 to 0.61] mm yr<sup>–1</sup>) over 2005–2010. These assessments included the 
Antarctic peripheral glaciers. AR5 reported with high confidence that the volume of the West Antarctic Ice 
Sheet (WAIS) was reduced during warm periods of the past few million years. SROCC concluded that over 
2006–2015, the AIS lost mass at an average rate of 155 ± 19 Gt yr–1 (very high confidence). SROCC stated 
also that it is virtually certain that the Antarctic Peninsula and WAIS combined have cumulatively lost mass 
since widespread measurements began in 1992, and that the rate of loss has increased since around 2006. 
 
Process understanding and, to some extent, paleoclimate records show that changes in parts of the AIS can  
occur over multi-century time scales (<2kyr) (e.g. Dowdeswell et al., 2020; Sections 9.4.2.3 and 9.6.2). 
Based on physical understanding, paleo evidence and numerical simulations, it is very likely that the AIS has 
been smaller than today during at least some past warm climates (such as MCO and LIG), in particular the 
WAIS (de Boer et al., 2015; Deconto & Pollard, 2016; Golledge et al., 2014; Levy et al., 2016) (Figure 
9.18). Results from sediment studies suggest a smaller AIS during the MPWP compared with current levels, 
with main differences in the WAIS (SROCC, Bertram et al., 2018; Shakun et al., 2018, Section 9.6.2). 
Marine sediments indicate that during the Pleistocene repeated ungrounding and loss of large marine-based 
parts of the AIS occurred during interglacial periods, with at least seven transitions between floating and 
grounded ice in the Ross Sea during the last 780 kyr (McKay et al., 2012) and at least three reductions in ice 
volume in the Wilkes Basin during the last 500 kyr (Wilson et al., 2018). Proxies, modelling and process 
understanding (Rohling et al., 2019; Clark et al., 2020) indicate that the AIS was smaller during the LIG than 
present.  
 
Geological evidence has been used to reconstruct Holocene glacial fluctuations of the ice sheet margin and 
lowerings of its surface, which occurred at different times in different places, as recently reviewed by Noble 
et al. (2020). In West Antarctica, marine sediments below the ice sheet (Kingslake et al., 2018) corroborate a 
previous glacial isostatic adjustment modelling study (Bradley et al., 2015), which suggests that ice had 
retreated behind the present grounding line prior to about 10 ka, and then readvanced. Geophysical imaging 
indicates a readvance in this area around 6 ± 2 ka (Wearing and Kingslake, 2019). Other studies from the 
region conclude that ice sheet retreat and thinning was fastest from 9 to 8 ka (Johnson et al., 2014; McKay et 
al., 2016; Spector et al., 2017), or millennia later, during the MH (Hein et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2019), 
with indications of a subsequent readvance (Venturelli et al., 2020). In East Antarctica, rapid ice sheet 
thinning occurred between around 9 and 5 ka (Jones et al., 2015), consistent with previous work indicating 
that the ice sheet in many regions was at or close to its current position by 5 ka (Bentley et al., 2014). 
Overall, during the MH, the AIS was retreating, but remained more extensive than present, while some parts 
of the ice sheet might have been smaller than now (low confidence).  
 
Improved estimates of surface mass balance (SMB) in Antarctica from 67 ice core records do not show any 
substantial changes in accumulation rates over most of Antarctica since 1200 CE (Frezzotti et al., 2013). The 
SMB growth rate in Antarctica is estimated to be 7.0 ± 0.1 Gt per decade between 1800 and 2010 and 14.0 ± 
1.8 Gt per decade since 1900 (Thomas et al., 2017). For the period 1979–2000, an insignificant Antarctic-
wide negative SMB trend has been estimated (Medley and Thomas, 2019). The Antarctic Ice Sheet lost 2670 
[1800 to 3540] Gt  (SLE 7.4 [5.0 to 9.8] mm) of ice between 1992 and 2020. The rate of ice sheet (including 
peripheral glaciers) mass loss rose from 0 [–36 to 40] Gt yr<sup>–1</sup> (SLE 0.0 [–0.10 to 0.11] mm yr<sup>–1</sup>) in 1901–
1990 to 192 [145 to 239] Gt yr<sup>–1</sup> (SLE 0.54 [0.47 to 0.61] mm yr<sup>–1</sup>) for 2006–2018 (Figure 2.24, Section 
9.4.2, Table 9.5). Within quantified uncertainties, this estimate agrees with other recent estimates (Rignot et 
al., 2019; Smith et al., 2020; Velicogna et al., 2020). There is therefore very high confidence that the AIS has 
been losing mass over 1992–2020 (Figure 2.24, Section 9.4.2.1).  Major contributions to recent AIS changes 
arise from West Antarctica and Wilkes Land in East Antarctica (Rignot et al., 2019). For the East Antarctic 
most studies suggest that the mass balance is not significantly different from zero (Bamber et al., 2018; 
IMBIE Consortium, 2018; Mohajerani et al., 2018; Rignot et al., 2019). 
 
In summary, the AIS has lost mass between 1992 and 2020 (very high confidence), and there is medium 
confidence that this mass loss has increased. During the MPWP and LIG, the ice sheet was smaller than 
present (medium confidence). There is low confidence as to whether the total mass of the ice sheet was larger 
or smaller around 6 ka compared to now. 
 
 
### 2.3.2.5  Terrestrial permafrost 
 
AR5 concluded that in most regions and at most monitoring sites permafrost temperatures since the 1980s 
had increased (high confidence). Negligible change was observed at a few sites, mainly where permafrost 
temperatures were close to 0°C, with slight cooling at a limited number of sites. AR5 also noted positive 
trends in active layer thickness (ALT; the seasonally thawed layer above the permafrost) since the 1990s for 
many high latitude sites (medium confidence). SROCC concluded permafrost temperatures have increased to 
record high levels since the 1980s (very high confidence) with a recent increase by 0.29°C ± 0.12°C from 
2007 to 2016 averaged across polar and high mountain regions globally. 
 
Permafrost occurrence during the Pliocene has been inferred from pollen in lake sediments in NE Arctic 
Russia and permafrost-vegetation relationships which indicate that permafrost was absent during the MPWP 
in this region (Brigham-Grette et al., 2013; Herzschuh et al., 2016). Analysis of speleothem records in 
Siberian caves, indicates that permafrost was absent in the current continuous permafrost zone at 60°N at the 
start of the 1.5 Ma record, with aggradation occurring around 0.4 Ma (Vaks et al., 2020). There are 
indications of extensive permafrost thaw during subsequent interglacials especially further south in the 
current permafrost zone (Vaks et al., 2013). Reconstruction of permafrost distribution during the LGM 
indicates that permafrost was more extensive in exposed areas (Vandenberghe et al., 2014). In non-glaciated 
areas of the North American Arctic there is permafrost that survived the LIG (French and Millar, 2014). 
Trends and timing of permafrost aggradation and thaw over the last 6 kyr in peatlands of the NH were 
recently summarized (Hiemstra, 2018; Treat and Jones, 2018a). Three multi-century periods (ending 1000 
Before the Common Era (BCE), 500 CE and 1850 CE) of permafrost aggradation, associated with 
neoglaciation periods are inferred resulting in more extensive permafrost in peatlands of the present-day 
discontinuous permafrost zone, which reached a peak approximately 250 years ago, with thawing occurring 
concurrently with post 1850 warming (Treat and Jones, 2018b). Although permafrost persists in peatlands at 
the southern extent of the permafrost zone where it was absent prior to 3 ka, there has been thawing since the 
1960s (Holloway & Lewkowicz, 2020; James et al., 2013; Jones et al., 2016). 
 
Records of permafrost temperature measured in several boreholes located throughout the northern polar 
regions indicate general warming of permafrost over the last 3–4 decades (Figure 2.25), with marked 
regional variations (Romanovsky et al., 2017a,b; 2020; Biskaborn et al., 2019). Recent (2018–2019) 
permafrost temperatures in the upper 20–30 m layer (at depths where seasonal variation is minimal) were the 
highest ever directly observed at most sites (Romanovsky et al., 2020), with temperatures in colder 
permafrost of northern North America being more than 1°C higher than they were in 1978. Increases in 
temperature of colder Arctic permafrost are larger (average 0.4°C–0.6°C per decade) than for warmer 
(temperature >–2C) permafrost (average 0.17°C per decade) of sub-Arctic regions (Figures 2.25, 9.22).  
 
<figref>2.25</figref> 
 
Increases in permafrost temperature over the last 10–30 years of up to 0.3°C per decade have been 
documented at depths of about 20 m in high elevation regions in the NH (European Alps, the Tibetan Plateau 
and some other high elevation areas in Asia; Biskaborn et al., 2019; Cao et al., 2018; Liu G. et al., 2017; 
Noetzli et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020). In Antarctica, where records are limited and short (most < 10 years) 
trends are less evident (Noetzli et al. 2019). 
 
Assessment of trends in ALT is complicated by considerable ALT interannual variability. For example, in 
north-western North America during the extreme warm year of 1998, ALT was greater than in prior years. 
Although ALT decreased over the following few years, it has generally increased again since the late 2000s 
(Duchesne, et al. 2015; Romanovsky et al., 2017b; 2020). However, at some sites there has been little change 
in ALT due to ground subsidence that accompanies thaw of ice-rich permafrost (Streletskiy et al., 2017; 
O’Neill et al., 2019). In the European and Russian Arctic there has been a broad-scale increase in ALT 
during the 21st century (Streletskiy et al., 2015; Romanovsky et al., 2020). In high elevation areas in Europe 
and Asia, increases in ALT have occurred since the mid-1990s (Cao et al., 2018; Liu, Y. et al., 2017; Noetzli 
et al., 2019; 2020; Zhao et al., 2020). Limited and shorter records for Antarctica show marked interannual 
variability and no apparent trend with ALT being relatively stable or decreasing at some sites since 2006 
(Hrbáček et al., 2018). 
 
Observations of ground subsidence and other landscape change (e.g. thermokarst, slope instability) since the 
middle of the 20th century in the Arctic associated with ground ice melting have been documented in several 
studies and provide additional indications of thawing permafrost (Borge et al., 2017; Derksen et al., 2019; 
Farquharson et al., 2019; Kokelj et al., 2017; Lewkowicz & Way, 2019; Liljedahl et al., 2016; Nitze et al., 
2017; O’Neill et al., 2019; Séjourné et al., 2015; Streletskiy et al., 2017; Section 9.5.2.1). In mountain areas, 
destabilization and acceleration of rock glacier complexes that may be associated with warming permafrost 
have also been observed (Eriksen et al., 2018; Marcer et al., 2019). 
 
In summary, increases in permafrost temperatures in the upper 30 m have been observed since the start of 
observational programs over the past three to four decades throughout the permafrost regions (high 
confidence). Limited evidence suggests that permafrost was less extensive during the MPWP (low 
confidence). Permafrost that formed after 3ka still persists in areas of the NH, but there are indications of 
thaw after the mid-1800s (medium confidence). 


## 2.3.3  Ocean 
 
This section focuses on large-scale changes in a subset of physical components of the ocean (Cross-Chapter 
Box 2.2). Chapter 7 assesses the role of the ocean in Earth system heating and evaluates the Earth’s energy 
budget. Chapter 9 undertakes a holistic assessment of changes in the ocean integrating observations, 
modelling and theoretical understanding. Chapter 11 assesses extremes such as marine heat waves and storm 
surges. SSTs are assessed in Section 2.3.1.1 as they constitute a critical component of GMST estimation.  
 
 
### 2.3.3.1  Ocean temperature, heat content and thermal expansion 
 
AR5 assessed that since 1971, global ocean warming was virtually certain for the upper 700 m and likely for 
the 700–2000 m layer. SROCC reported linear warming trends for the 0–700 m and 700–2000 m layers of 
the ocean of 4.35 ± 0.8 and 2.25 ± 0.64 ZJ yr<sup>–1</sup> over 1970-2017; 6.28 ± 0.48 and 3.86 ± 2.09 ZJ yr<sup>–1</sup> over 
1993–2017; and 5.31 ± 0.48 and 4.02 ± 0.97 ZJ yr<sup>–1</sup> over 2005–2017. Both AR5 and SROCC assessed that 
the ocean below 2000 m had likely warmed since 1992. SROCC reported global mean thermosteric sea level 
(ThSL) rise, associated with thermal expansion of the ocean, with a trend of 0.89 ± 0.05 mm yr<sup>–1</sup> for 1970–
2015; 1.36 ± 0.40 mm yr<sup>–1</sup> for 1993–2015; and 1.40 ± 0.40 mm yr<sup>–1</sup> for 2006–2015, and also reported that the 
rate of ocean warming over 1993-2017 had likely more than doubled since 1969–1992. 
 
New ocean heat content (OHC) reconstructions derived from paleo proxies (Baggenstos et al., 2019; Bereiter 
et al., 2018; Gebbie, 2021; Shackleton et al., 2019) indicate that the global ocean warmed by 2.57°C ± 
0.24°C, at an average rate of ~0.3°C ka-1 (equivalent to an OHC change rate of 1.3 ZJ yr<sup>–1</sup>) from the LGM 
(∼20 ka) to the early Holocene (∼10 ka) (Figure 9.9, Section 9.2.2.1). Over the LDT, ocean warming 
occurred in two stages, offset by some heat loss during the Antarctic Cold Reversal (14.58–12.75 ka). Only 
during a short period of rapid warming at the end of the Younger Dryas (12.75–11.55 ka) were rates 
comparable to those observed since the 1970s (Bereiter et al., 2018; Shackleton et al., 2019). Ice cores imply 
a small decrease in the global mean ocean temperature during the early Holocene (<0.4°C) (Baggenstos et 
al., 2019; Bereiter et al., 2018). Sediment cores from the equatorial Pacific and Atlantic Ocean (0–1000 m) 
indicate a stronger regional cooling (compared to mean ocean temperature) of 1.0°C ± 0.7°C to 1.8°C ± 
0.4°C from the early/mid-Holocene to ca.1750 CE (Kalansky et al., 2015; Morley et al., 2014; Rosenthal et 
al., 2017; 2013). Sediment cores from the western equatorial Pacific suggest 0.8°C ± 0.1°C higher 
temperatures in the upper 700 m of the ocean during 950–1100 CE compared to 1400–1750 CE. These 
changes are consistent with a global estimate derived from combined surface and subsurface ocean 
temperature proxy records (McGregor et al., 2015; PAGES 2k Consortium, 2013). A combined study of 
model and observational data further confirmed these results, treating temperature as a passive tracer 
(Gebbie & Huybers, 2019) and addressing the role of circulation dynamics (Scheen and Stocker, 2020). 
Collectively, the proxy records indicate a global OHC decrease of ~400 ± 70 ZJ (~170 ± 100 ZJ in the 
Pacific) in the upper 700 m between 950–1100 CE and 1400–1750 CE, and also suggest that the deep Pacific 
is still adjusting to this cooling (Rosenthal et al., 2013), partially offsetting the global increase since 1750 CE 
(Gebbie & Huybers, 2019; Gebbie, 2021). 
 
For the instrumental era, since AR5 and SROCC, new and updated OHC (and ThSL) observation-based 
analyses (Johnson et al., 2020; von Schuckmann et al., 2020) enhance an existing large ensemble of direct 
and indirect OHC estimates (Figure 2.26), although some rely to varying degrees upon information from 
ocean-climate models. Direct estimates benefit from improved: bias adjustments (e.g. Bagnell & DeVries, 
2020; Cheng et al., 2018; Gouretski & Cheng, 2020; Leahy et al., 2018; Palmer et al., 2018; Ribeiro et al., 
2018; Wang et al., 2018); interpolation methods (Kuusela & Stein, 2018; Su et al., 2020); and 
characterization of sources of uncertainty (e.g.(Allison et al., 2019; Garry et al., 2019; Good, 2017; 
Meyssignac et al., 2019; Palmer et al., 2021; Wunsch, 2018), including those originating from forced and 
intrinsic ocean variability (Penduff et al. 2018). After 2006 direct OHC estimates for the upper 2000 m layer 
benefit from the near-global ARGO array with its superior coverage over 60S–60N (Roemmich et al., 
2019). Indirect estimates include OHC and ThSL series inferred from satellite altimetry and gravimetry since 
2003 (Meyssignac et al., 2019), the passive uptake of OHC (ThSL) at centennial timescales inferred from 
observed SST anomalies, and time-invariant circulation processes from an ocean state estimation (e.g. Zanna 
et al., 2019). Resplandy et al. (2019) estimate the rate of global OHC uptake over 1991–2016 from changes 
in atmospheric composition and physical relationships based on CMIP5 model simulations. The uncertainties 
are broader than from direct estimates but the estimate is qualitatively consistent. 
 
Collectively, the new and updated analyses strengthen AR5 and SROCC findings of a sustained increase in 
global OHC (Figure 2.26, Table 2.7) and associated ThSL rise. Larger warming rates are observed in the 
upper 700 m compared to deeper layers, with more areas exhibiting significant warming than significant 
cooling (Johnson & Lyman, 2020). There is an improved consistency among available estimates of OHC 
rates in the upper 2000 m since 2006. Cheng et al. (2020), von Schuckmann et al. (2020) and Johnson et al. 
(2020) have further confirmed that the central estimates of rates of OHC change in the upper 2000 m depths 
have increased after 1993 and particularly since 2010 (Section 3.5.1.3, Figures 2.26, 3.26), although 
uncertainties are large (Table 2.7). Ocean reanalyses support findings of continued upper ocean warming 
(Balmaseda et al., 2013; Meyssignac et al., 2019; von Schuckmann et al., 2018), albeit with higher spread 
than solely observational estimates, particularly in the poorly sampled deep ocean below 2000 m (Palmer et 
al., 2018; Storto et al., 2017).  
 
In summary, current multidecadal to centennial rates of OHC gain are greater than at any point since the last 
deglaciation (medium confidence). At multi-centennial timescales, changes in OHC based upon proxy 
indicators demonstrate a tight link with surface temperature changes during the last deglaciation (high 
confidence), as well as during the Holocene and CE (low confidence). It is likely the global ocean has 
warmed since 1871, consistent with the observed increase in sea surface temperature. It is virtually certain 
that OHC increased between 1971 and 2018 in the upper 700 m and very likely in the 700–2000 m layer, 
with high confidence since 2006. It is likely the OHC below 2000 m has increased since 1992. Confidence in 
the assessment of multidecadal OHC increase is further strengthened by consistent closure of both global sea 
level and energy budgets (Section 7.2.2.2, Box 7.2, Cross-Chapter Box 9.1).

### 2.3.3.2  Ocean salinity  
 
AR5 concluded that subtropical regions of high salinity (where evaporation dominates over precipitation) 
had become more saline, while regions of low salinity (mostly in the tropics and high latitudes) had very 
likely become fresher since the 1950s, both at the near-surface, and in the ocean interior along ventilation 
pathways. From 1950 to 2008, the mean surface contrast between high- and low-salinity regions increased 
by 0.13 [0.08 to 0.17] (PSS-78, Unesco, 1981). Across basins, the Atlantic Ocean had become saltier and the 
Pacific and Southern Oceans had freshened (very likely).  
 
Prior to the instrumental record, reconstructions of near-surface salinity change are accomplished by 
combining isotopic and elemental proxy data from microfossil plankton shells and skeletons preserved in 
deep-sea sediments. These data highlight changes in the salinity contrast between the Pacific and Atlantic 
oceans during past ice ages (Broecker, 1989; Keigwin and Cook, 2007; Costa et al., 2018) and for repeated 
episodes of increased subtropical salinity (Schmidt et al., 2004, 2006) and subpolar freshening (Cortijo et al., 
1997; Thornalley et al., 2011) in the North Atlantic ocean. These episodes were associated with disruptions 
to the large-scale deep ocean circulation (Buizert et al., 2015; Henry et al., 2016; Lynch-Stieglitz, 2017). 
Further quantification of paleo salinity changes is complicated by incomplete understanding on how proxy-
salinity relationships and the relative influence of atmospheric and ocean processes vary across regions and 
paleo periods (Conroy et al., 2017; Holloway et al., 2016; LeGrande & Schmidt, 2011; Rohling, 2007). 
 
Since AR5, new and extended multidecadal analyses have strengthened the observational support for 
increased contrast between high and low near-surface salinity regions and inter-basin contrast since the mid-
20th century (Section 9.2.2.2; Aretxabaleta et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2020; Durack & Wijffels, 2010; Good 
et al., 2013; Skliris et al., 2014). These analyses employ different statistical algorithms for interpolation, and 
only Cheng et al., (2020) use CMIP5 model simulations to constrain observation-based signals in data-sparse 
regions. 
 
The 1950–2019 trends reveal near-surface freshening of the northern and western Warm (and fresh) Pool of 
the Pacific and increased salinity maxima in the subtropical Atlantic, strengthening the inter-basin contrast 
(Figure 2.27a). There are indications that the subpolar freshening and subtropical salinification of the 
Atlantic ocean may extend back to at least 1896 (Friedman et al., 2017). Over recent decades, new 
observations from Argo floats and ocean reanalyses provide general support that changes in the global 
patterns of near-surface salinity contrast are broadly associated with an intensification of the hydrological 
cycle (Sections 2.3.1.3.5; 8.3.1.1). However, this assessment is complicated by changing observational 
techniques (Section 1.5.1), temporally and spatially inhomogeneous sampling and uncertainties in 
interpolation algorithms and the substantial influence of modes of natural variabiltity and ocean circulation 
processes over interannual timescales (Aretxabaleta et al., 2017; Durack, 2015; Grist et al., 2016; Liu et al., 
2020; Skliris et al., 2014; Vinogradova & Ponte, 2017). Following AR5, based on the updated analysis from 
Durack and Wijffels (2010) which infills in situ gaps to recover large-scale patterns the mean salinity 
contrast between high- and low- near-surface salinity regions increased by 0.14 [0.07 to 0.20] from 1950 to 2019. 
 
Changes in the global patterns of near-surface salinity contrast are transferred to the ocean interior via 
ventilation pathways (Figure 2.27b). Large scale similarities in subsurface salinity changes across 
observational estimates point to decreasing (increasing) salinity in regions where salinity is lower (higher) 
than the global average, with freshening in subpolar regions and salinification in the subtropical gyres 
(Aretxabaleta et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2020; Durack, 2015; Durack & Wijffels, 2010; Good et al., 2013; 
Skliris et al., 2014). Regional changes in salinity are assessed in Section 9.2.2.2. 
 
In summary, it is virtually certain that since 1950 near-surface high salinity regions have become more 
saline, while low salinity regions have become fresher, and it is very likely that this extends to the ocean 
interior along ventilation pathways. Across basins, it is very likely that the Atlantic has become saltier and 
the Pacific and Southern oceans have freshened. The differences between high-salinity and low-salinity 
regions are linked to an intensification of the hydrological cycle (medium confidence).

### 2.3.3.3  Sea level 

AR5 concluded based on proxy and instrumental data that the rate of global mean sea level (GMSL) rise 
since the mid-19th century was larger than the mean rate during the previous two millennia (high confidence). 
SROCC reported with high confidence that GMSL increases were 1.5 [1.1 to 1.9] mm yr -1 for 1902–2010 
(with an acceleration rate between -0.002–0.019 mm yr -2), 2.1 [1.8 to 2.3] mm yr -1 for 1970–2015, 3.2 [2.8 
to 3.5] mm yr -1 for 1993–2015 and 3.6 [3.1 to 4.1] mm yr -1 for 2006–2015. AR5 reported that GMSL 
during the LIG was, over several thousand years, between 5 and 10 m higher than 1985–2004 (medium 
confidence) whereas SROCC concluded it was virtually certain that GMSL exceeded current levels (high 
confidence), and reached a peak that was likely 6–9 m higher than today, but did not exceed 10 m (medium 
confidence). AR5 concluded with high confidence that there were two intra-LIG GMSL peaks and that the 
millennial-scale rate during these periods exceeded 2mm yr<sup>–1</sup>. AR5 had high confidence that GMSL during 
the MPWP did not exceed 20 m above present. Based on new understanding, SROCC placed the upper 
bound at 25 m but with low confidence. 
 
The Earth was largely ice free during the EECO (Cramer et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2020, Section 9.6.2), and  
complete loss of current land ice reservoirs would raise GMSL by 65.6 ± 1.8 m (Farinotti et al., 2019; 
Morlighem et al., 2017; 2020). Given that GMSL change must be due to some combination of transient land 
ice growth and changes in terrestrial water storage, additional global mean thermosteric sea-level increase of 
7 ± 2 m (Fischer et al., 2018) implies a peak EECO GMSL of 70–76 m (low confidence). Changes in ocean 
basin size driven by plate tectonics contributed a comparable amount to global mean geocentric sea level in 
the Eocene, but are definitionally excluded from GMSL assessment (Wright et al., 2020). 
 
For the MPWP, several studies of coastal features have provided additional quantitative sea-level estimates 
of: 5.6–19.2 m from Spain (Dumitru et al., 2019), approximately 14 m from South Africa (Hearty et al., 
2020), 15 m from the United States (Moucha and Ruetenik, 2017), and 25 m from New Zealand (Grant et al., 
2019). Thus, consistent with SROCC, GMSL during the MPWP was higher than present by 5–25 m (medium 
confidence). 
 
Reconstructions of GMSL from marine oxygen isotopes in foraminifera shells show variations of more than 
100 m over intervals of 10–100 kyr during glacial-interglacial cycles of the Quaternary (McManus et al., 
1999; Miller et al., 2020; Shackleton, 1987; Waelbroeck et al., 2002). Correction for past temperatures and a 
calibration for ice-volume changes implies uncertainty estimates of ± 10–13 m (1 SD) (Grant et al., 2014; 
Shakun et al., 2015; Spratt & Lisiecki, 2016). A recent marine oxygen-isotope-based GMSL reconstruction 
(Spratt and Lisiecki, 2016) agrees with previous reconstructions, while focusing on the past 800 kyr (Figure 
2.28). It shows that GMSL during the Holocene was among the highest over this entire interval, and was 
surpassed only during the LIG (Marine Isotope Stage (MIS 5e)) and MIS 11 (medium confidence); however, 
relatively brief (about 2 kyr) highstands during other interglacial periods might be obscured by dating 
limitations. 
 
Few sites globally have well-preserved MIS 11 sea-level indicators (Dutton et al., 2015). As reported in 
AR5, Raymo and Mitrovica (2012) used glacial isostatic adjustment models to correct the elevation of MIS 
11 sea-level proxies from Bermuda and Bahamas to estimate a peak MIS 11 GMSL between 6 and 13 m 
above present-day. This agrees with the elevation of 13 ± 2 m for the MIS 11 subtidal–intertidal transition in 
South Africa (Roberts et al., 2012). A revised glacial isostatic adjustment at this location resulted in a peak 
GMSL estimate of 8–11.5 m (Chen et al., 2014). In light of these data, and the review by Dutton et al. 
(2015), the AR5 estimate of 6–13 m for MIS 11 remains the best available (medium confidence). 
 
Recent studies have highlighted uncertainties in estimates of GMSL during the LIG, including the extent of 
GMSL variability (Capron et al., 2019). Vertical land motions (Austermann et al., 2017) are starting to be 
considered quantitatively (e.g., Stephenson et al., 2019), but are still bounded by large uncertainties. The 
distribution and thickness of pre-LIG ice sheets (Dendy et al., 2017; Rohling et al., 2017) and isostasy driven 
by sediment loading since the LIG (Pico, 2020) add further uncertainty. In light of these recent studies and 
previous assessments, there is medium confidence that peak GMSL during the LIG was likely between 5 and 
10 m higher than modern. Relative sea-level estimates from some sites (e.g., Bahamas and Seychelles) report 
ephemeral, metre-scale fluctuations (Vyverberg et al., 2018). Different generations of LIG reef growth at 
other sites (e.g., Yucatan Peninsula, Western Australia) suggest the occurrence of sudden accelerations in 
GMSL change (Blanchon et al., 2009; O’Leary et al., 2013). However, other sites (e.g., South Australia, 
Mediterranean), indicate that LIG sea level was substantially stable (Pan, Y-T. et al., 2018; Polyak et al., 
2018). In addition, there are uncertainties in the interpretation of local relative sea level from some GMSL 
reconstructions (Barlow et al., 2018). Therefore, low confidence is assigned to any GMSL rate of change 
estimated within the LIG. 
 
New geological proxies and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) modelling studies confirm that, at the LGM, 
GMSL was 125–134 m below present (Lambeck et al., 2014; Yokoyama et al., 2018). During the LDT, 
GMSL rose from approximately -120 m to -50 m, implying an average rate of about 10 mm yr<sup>–1</sup> (Lambeck et 
al., 2014). The fastest rise occurred during Meltwater Pulse 1A, at about 14.6–14.3 ka ( Deschamps et al., 
2012; Sanborn et al., 2017), when GMSL rose by between 8 m and 15 m (medium confidence) (Liu J. et al., 
2016) at an average rate of 24–44 mm yr<sup>–1</sup>.  
 
Recent GIA modelling studies tuned to both near- and far-field relative sea level (RSL) data yield MH 
GMSL estimates of -3.8 to -1.0 m (Lambeck et al., 2014; Peltier et al., 2015; Bradley et al., 2016; Roy and 
Peltier, 2017). Estimates from relatively stable locations where the effects of GIA are small and relatively 
insensitive to parameters defining Earth rheology, and where RSL is expected to approximate GMSL to 
within about 1 m (e.g., Milne & Mitrovica, 2008), suggest that RSL was between about -6 to 1.5 m at around 
6 ka at multiple locations (Braithwaite et al., 2000; Camoin et al., 1997; Frank et al., 2006; Hibbert et al., 
2018; Khan et al., 2017; Montaggioni & Faure, 2008; Vacchi et al., 2016). The assessment of GMSL change 
at 6 kyr is challenging considering the proportionately large GIA effect (Kopp et al., 2016a), insufficient 
resolution of marine geochemical proxies (δ18O, Mg/Ca) and uncertainties in the contribution of the 
Antarctic Ice Sheet during the MH (Section 2.3.2.4). The possibility that GMSL was at least somewhat 
higher than present cannot be excluded. 
 
For the last 3 kyr, GMSL has been estimated from global databases of sea-level proxies, including numerous 
densely-sampled high-resolution salt-marsh records with decimetre scale vertical resolution and sub-
centennial temporal resolution (Kopp et al., 2016b; Kemp et al., 2018a). Over the last about 1.5 kyr, the most 
prominent century-scale GMSL trends include average maximum rates of lowering and rising of -0.7 ± 0.5 
mm yr<sup>–1</sup> (2 SD) over 1020–1120 CE, and 0.3 ± 0.5 (2 SD) over 1460–1560, respectively. Between 1000 and 
1750 CE, GMSL is estimated to have been within the range of about -0.11–0.09 m relative to 1900 (Kemp et 
al., 2018b). This was followed by a sustained increase of GMSL that began between 1820 and 1860 and has 
continued to the present day. New analyses demonstrate that it is very likely that GMSL rise over the 20th 
century was faster than over any preceding century in at least 3 kyr (Kopp et al., 2016a; Kemp et al., 2018a) 
(Figure 2.28).  
 
<figref>2.28</figref> 
 
Since SROCC, two new tide gauge reconstructions of 20th century GMSL change  have been published, 
although both rely upon CMIP models to varying degrees (Figure 2.28). Frederikse et al (2020) used a 
“virtual station” method and a probabilistic framework to estimate GMSL change and its uncertainties since 1900.
Dangendorf et al (2019) combined a Kalman Smoother (Hay et al., 2015) with Reduced Space 

Optimal Interpolation (Church & White, 2011; Ray & Douglas, 2011) in an effort to better represent both the 
long-term GMSL change while preserving information on sea-level variability. In addition, new ensemble-
based methods for quantifying GMSL change have been presented that account for both structural and 
parametric uncertainty (Palmer et al., 2021). Altimeter timeseries of GMSL change (Figure 2.28) have been 
extended to 2019/2020 but bias adjustments (Ablain et al., 2019; Beckley et al., 2017; Dieng et al., 2017; 
Legeais et al., 2020; Watson et al., 2015) did not change since SROCC.  
 
Based on the ensemble approach of Palmer et al (2021) and an updated WCRP (2018) assessment (Figure 
2.28) GMSL rose at a rate of 1.35 [0.78 to 1.92] mm yr<sup>–1</sup> for the period 1901–1990 and 3.25 [2.88 to 3.61] 
mm yr<sup>–1</sup> for 1993–2018 (high confidence). The average rate for 1901–2018 was 1.73 [1.28 to 2.17] mm yr<sup>–1</sup> 
with a total rise of 0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m (Table 9.5). The acceleration rate very likely is 0.094 [0.082 to 
0.115] mm yr–2 for 1993–2018 (WCRP, 2018, updated), consistent with other estimates (Ablain et al., 2019; 
Chen X. et al., 2017; Legeais et al. 2020; Nerem et al., 2018; Watson et al., 2015; WCRP, 2018). For the 
period 1902–2010 the updated tide gauge reconstructions published since the SROCC also show a robust 
acceleration over the 20th century and the ensemble estimate of Palmer et al (2021) gives a value of 0.0053 
[0.0042 to 0.0073] mm yr-2, based on an unweighted quadratic fit. 
 
In summary, GMSL is rising, and the rate of GMSL rise since the 20th century is faster than over any 
preceding century in at least the last three millennia (high confidence). Since 1901, GMSL has risen by 0.20 
[0.15 to 0.25] m at an accelerating rate. Further back in time, there is medium confidence that GMSL was 
within –3.5–0.5 m (very likely range) of present during the MH, 5–10 m higher (likely range) during the LIG, 
and 5–25 m higher (very likely range) during the MPWP. 
 
 
### 2.3.3.4  Ocean circulation 
 
#### 2.3.3.4.1  Atlantic Meridional Overturning circulation (AMOC) 
AR5 concluded that there was no evidence of a trend in the AMOC during the period of instrumental 
observations. However, AR5 also stressed insufficient evidence to support a finding of change in the heat 
transport of the AMOC. SROCC assessed that there was emerging evidence in sustained observations, both 
in situ (2004–2017) and revealed from SST-based reconstructions, that the AMOC had weakened during the 
instrumental era relative to 1850–1900 (medium confidence), although there were insufficient data to 
quantify the magnitude of the weakening. SROCC also concluded with low confidence an increase of the 
Southern Ocean upper cell overturning circulation. SROCC also reported with medium confidence that the 
production of Antarctic Bottom Water had decreased since the 1950s consistent with a decreased lower cell 
overturning circulation, and potentially modulating the strength of the AMOC. 
 
On multi-millennial timescales, proxy evidence indicates that the AMOC varied repeatedly in strength and 
vertical structure. During the last glacial period, particularly around the LGM, AMOC was estimated to be 
shallower than present, although there is continued debate about the magnitude of the shoaling (Gebbie, 
2014; Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 2007), and whether this change was associated with a weaker overturning (Ritz 
et al., 2013; Menviel et al., 2017; Muglia et al., 2018). There are indications that substantial variations in 
AMOC were associated with abrupt climate changes during the glacial intervals, including Dansgaard-
Oeschger and Heinrich events (14–70 ka) (Böhm et al., 2015; Henry et al., 2016; Lynch-Stieglitz, 2017; 
McManus et al., 2004). During these millennial-scale oscillations, weakened AMOC was associated with 
dramatic cooling in the northern hemisphere and warming in the southern hemisphere (Buizert et al., 2015; 
Henry et al., 2016), while hemispheric changes of opposite sign accompanied strengthened AMOC. After the 
final demise of the Laurentide ice sheet about 8 ka, the mean overall strength of AMOC has been relatively 
stable throughout the rest of the Holocene compared to the preceding 100 kyr (Hoffmann et al., 2018; 
Lippold et al., 2019). There are however indications of episodic variations in AMOC during the Holocene 
(Bianchi and McCave, 1999; Oppo et al., 2003; Thornalley et al., 2013; Ayache et al., 2018), and past 
interglacial intervals (Galaasen et al., 2014, 2020; Hayes et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2020; Mokeddem et al., 
2014). Over the last 3 kyr, there are indications that AMOC variability was potentially linked to decreasing 
production of Labrador Sea Water (LSW), one of the water masses contributing to AMOC (Alonso-Garcia et 
al., 2017; McClymont et al., 2020; Moffa-Sánchez et al., 2019; Moffa-Sánchez & Hall, 2017). 
 
Numerous proxy records collectively imply that AMOC is currently at its weakest point in the past 1.6 ka 
(Caesar et al., 2018, 2021; Rahmstorf et al., 2015; Thibodeau et al., 2018; Thornalley et al., 2018). Caesar et 
al. (2021) analyse a compilation of various available indirect AMOC proxies from marine sediments, in situ-
based reconstructions and terrestrial proxies, which show a decline beginning in the late 19th century and 
over the 20th century superimposed by large decadal variability in the second half of the 20th century. 
Indirect reconstructions of AMOC components based on coastal sea level records in the western North 
Atlantic (Ezer, 2013; McCarthy et al., 2015; Piecuch, 2020) show an AMOC decline since the late 1950s, 
with only a short period of recovery during the 1990s. 
 
However, other studies highlight that proxy records do not show such clear signals (Moffa-Sánchez et al., 
2019), and the use of SST- and coastal sea level-based  proxies of AMOC places uncertainties on these 
results (Jackson & Wood, 2020; Little et al., 2019; Menary et al., 2020). For instance, SSTs are additionally 
influenced by atmospheric and non-AMOC related ocean variability (Josey et al., 2018; Keil et al., 2020; 
Menary et al., 2020), while sea level responds to a variety of factors (e.g. atmospheric pressure and local 
winds) independent of the AMOC (Woodworth et al., 2014; Piecuch and Ponte, 2015; Piecuch et al., 2016). 
Finally, large decadal variability is present in many reconstructions and obscures estimation of the long-term 
trend over the 20th century (Caesar et al., 2021; Ezer, 2013; McCarthy et al., 2015; Thornalley et al., 2018; 
Yashayaev & Loder, 2016). It is also noted that the proxy reported AMOC decline, beginning in the late 19th 
century, is not supported by model-based evidence (Sections 3.5.4.1. and 9.2.3.l). 
 
Since the 1980s, multiple lines of observational evidence for AMOC change exist. Ship-based hydrographic 
estimates of AMOC as far back as the 1980s show no overall decline in AMOC strength (Fu et al., 2020; 
Worthington et al., 2020). Direct indications from in-situ observations report a –2.5 ± 1.4 Sv change between 
1993 and 2010 across the OVIDE section, superimposed on large interannual to decadal variability (Mercier 
et al., 2015). At 41°N and 26°N, a decline of –3.1 ± 3.2 Sv per decade and –2.5 ± 2.1 Sv per decade 
respectively has been reported over 2004–2016 (Baringer et al., 2018; Smeed et al., 2018). However, Moat et 
al. (2020) report an increase in AMOC strength at 26°N over 2009–2018. Recent time series of moored 
observations at 11ºS (Hummels et al., 2015), 34ºS (Meinen et al., 2018; Kersalé et al., 2020), and between 57 
and 60ºN (Lozier et al., 2019a) are currently too short to permit robust conclusions about changes. The 
directly observed AMOC weakening since 2004, while significant, is over too short a period to assess 
whether it is part of a longer term trend or dominated by decadal‐scale internal variability (Smeed et al., 
2014; Collins et al., 2019; Moat et al., 2020). Notably an increase and subsequent decline in the 1990s is 
present in estimates of AMOC and associated heat transport constructed from reanalyses or auxiliary data 
(Frajka-Williams, 2015; Jackson & Wood, 2020; Jackson et al., 2016; Trenberth & Fasullo, 2017) (Section 
9.2.3.1). 
 
Repeated full depth in situ measurements report that deep convection - a major driver for AMOC - has 
recently returned to the Labrador Sea (particularly in 2015; Rhein et al., 2017; Yashayaev & Loder, 2016), 
and Irminger Sea (de Jong et al., 2018; de Jong & de Steur, 2016; Gladyshev et al., 2016) following an 
extended period with weak convection since 2000. An associated strengthening of the outflow from the 
Labrador Sea has not been observed (Zantopp et al., 2017; Lozier et al., 2019b), while strengthening of the 
AMOC is tentative (Desbruyères et al., 2019; Moat et al., 2020). A long-term increase of the upper 
overturning cell in the Southern Ocean since the 1990s can be assessed with low confidence, and there is 
medium confidence of a decrease in Antarctic bottom water (AABW) volume and circulation, which has 
potential implications for the strength of the AMOC (Section 9.2.3.2). 
 
In summary, proxy-based reconstructions suggested that the AMOC was relatively stable during the past 8 
kyr (medium confidence), with a weakening beginning since the late 19th century (medium confidence), but 
due to a lack of direct observations, confidence in an overall decline of AMOC during the 20th century is 
low. From mid-2000s to mid-2010s, the directly observed weakening in AMOC (high confidence) cannot be 
distinguished between decadal-scale variability or a long-term trend (high confidence). 


#### 2.3.3.4.2  Western boundary currents and inter-basin exchanges 
Both AR5 and SROCC reported that western boundary currents (WBCs) have undergone an intensification, 
warming and poleward expansion, except for the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio, but did not provide 
confidence statements. AR5 reported with medium to high confidence intensification of the North Pacific 
subpolar gyre, the South Pacific subtropical gyre, and the subtropical cells, along with an expansion of the 
North Pacific subtropical gyre since the 1990s. It was pointed out that these changes are likely predominantly 
due to interannual-to-decadal variability, and in the case of the subtropical cells represent a reversal of earlier 
multi-decadal change. SROCC concluded that it was unlikely that there has been a statistically significant net 
southward movement of the mean Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) position over the past 20 years, in 
contrast to AR5, where this change had been assessed with medium confidence.  
 
The intensity of the Kuroshio current system in the northwest Pacific varied in conjunction with the 
glaciation cycles over the last 1 Myr, with some limited glacial-interglacial variability in position (Jian et al., 
2000; Gallagher et al., 2015). The Agulhas current has strengthened substantially during the warming 
associated with deglaciations of the past 1 Myr (Peeters et al., 2004; Bard and Rickaby, 2009; Martínez-
Méndez et al., 2010; Marino et al., 2013; Ballalai et al., 2019). According to sediment core analyses, the 
Agulhas leakage varied by about 10 Sv during major climatic transitions over the past 640 kyr (Caley et al., 
2014). Available data suggests that there was relatively little change in the net flow of the ACC in the LGM, 
with no consensus on the sign of changes (Lamy et al., 2015; Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 2016; McCave et al., 
2013), except at one location at the northern edge of the Drake Passage where a 40% decrease of transport 
had been reported (Lamy et al., 2015). Longer time series from the northern entrance to Drake Passage 
suggest a consistent transport variability of 6–16% through glacial climate cycles, with higher current speeds 
during interglacial times and reduced current speeds during glacial intervals (Toyos et al., 2020). Inferred 
variability in the size and strength of the North Atlantic subpolar gyre was substantial, and included rapid 
changes on millennial time scales during both interglacial and glacial intervals over the last 150 kyr (Born 
and Levermann, 2010; Mokeddem et al., 2014b; Irvalı et al., 2016; Mokeddem and McManus, 2016). North 
Atlantic – Arctic exchange has also varied in the past, with indications of an increasing inflow of Atlantic 
waters into the Arctic during the late Holocene (Ślubowska et al., 2005) with an acceleration to the recent 
inflow that is now the largest of the past 2 kyr (Spielhagen et al., 2011). 
 
A latitudinal shift of subtropical/subpolar gyres on the order of 0.1 ± 0.04 per decade is derived by an 
indirect method using remote sensing data during 1993–2018 (Yang H. et al., 2020). Direct observations 
show a systematic poleward migration of WBCs (Bisagni et al., 2017; Wu L. et al., 2012; Yang H.  et al., 
2016, 2020). However, they do not support an intensification of WBCs, with a weakening, broadening, or 
little change reported for the Kuroshio (Collins et al., 2019; Wang & Wu, 2018; Wang et al., 2016), Gulf 
Stream (Andres et al., 2020; Collins et al., 2019; Dong et al., 2019; McCarthy et al., 2018), Agulhas (Beal 
and Elipot, 2016; Elipot and Beal, 2018) and East Australian (Sloyan and O’Kane, 2015) currents. The Gulf 
Stream has recently reversed a long-term poleward migration (Bisagni et al., 2017). Multidecadal variability 
of the strength and position of WBCs (Bisagni et al., 2017; Hsin, 2015; McCarthy et al., 2018) and short 
records from direct observations obscure the detection of any long-term trends (Yang H. et al., 2020). 
 
The Pacific to Arctic exchange at the Bering Strait plays a minor role in the total Arctic exchange with the 
global ocean, which has increased from 0.8 Sv to 1.0 Sv over 1990–2015 (Woodgate, 2018). For Atlantic-
Arctic exchange, major branches of Atlantic Water inflow from the North Atlantic into the Arctic across the 
Greenland-Scotland Ridge have remained stable since the mid-1990s (Berx et al., 2013; Hansen et al., 2015; 
Jochumsen et al., 2017; Østerhus et al., 2019), with only the smaller pathway of Atlantic Water north of 
Iceland showing a strengthening trend during 1993–2018 (Casanova-Masjoan et al., 2020), but with 
associated heat transport strengthening through the 1990s (Rossby et al., 2020; Tsubouchi et al., 2021). The 
Arctic outflow remained broadly stable from the mid-1990s to the mid 2010 (Osterhus et al., 2019). The heat 
and mass transport of the Indonesian throughflow (ITF) shows substantial variability at seasonal to decadal 
time scales (Feng M. et al., 2017, 2018; Li M. et al., 2018; Liu Q.-Y. et al., 2015; Sprintall et al., 2019; 
Susanto & Song, 2015; Xie T. et al., 2019; Zhuang et al., 2013). Liu et al. (2015) reported an increasing 
trend in the ITF geostrophic transport of 1 Sv per decade over 1984–2013, consistent with direct estimates 
(Sprintall et al., 2014), and results from reanalyses (Li et al., 2018), and this appears to be linked to multi-
decadal scale variability rather than a long-term trend (England et al., 2014; Kosaka & Xie, 2013; Lee S.-K. 
et al., 2015). Southern Ocean circulation changes are assessed in SROCC (Meredith et al., 2019), and are 
confirmed and synthesized in Section 9.2.3.2 which shows that there is no indication of ACC transport 
change, and that it is unlikely that the mean meridional position of the ACC has moved southward in recent 
decades. 
 
In summary, over the past 3–4 decades, the WBC strength is highly variable (high confidence), and WBCs 
and subtropical gyres have shifted poleward since 1993 (medium confidence). Net Arctic Ocean volume 
exchanges with the other ocean basins remained stable over the mid-1990s to the mid-2010s (high 
confidence). There is high confidence that the ITF shows strong multi-decadal scale variability since the 
1980s. 
 
 
### 2.3.3.5  Ocean pH 
 
AR5 assessed with high confidence that the pH of the ocean surface has decreased since preindustrial times, 
primarily as a result of ocean uptake of CO₂. SROCC concluded that the global ocean absorbed 20–30% of 
total CO₂ emissions since the 1980s, with virtually certain ocean surface pH decline. The SROCC assessed a 
rate of surface pH decline of 0.017–0.027 pH units per decade across a range of time series of pH 
observations longer than 15 years. The decline in surface open ocean pH was assessed by SROCC as having 
very likely already emerged from background natural variability for more than 95% of the global surface 
open ocean. 
 
Understanding of changes in surface pH at paleo time-scales has increased since AR5 (Anagnostou et al., 
2020; Clarkson et al., 2015; Foster & Rae, 2016; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Harper et al., 2020; Henehan et al., 
2019; Müller et al., 2020; Sosdian et al., 2018; Zeebe et al., 2016). Over the last 65 million years there have 
been several intervals when the pH of surface waters varied concurrently with climate change such as during 
the PETM, EECO, and MCO (Figure 2.29a) (Section 5.3.1.1). However, only during the PETM is the change 
sufficiently well-constrained to allow for a direct comparison with recent and current trends (Turner, 2018). 
This event was associated with profound perturbations of the global carbon cycle, ocean warming, 
deoxygenation and a surface ocean pH decrease likely ranging from 0.15 to 0.30 units (Penman et al., 2014; 
Gutjahr et al., 2017; Babila et al., 2018) - a rate that was likely at least an order of magnitude slower than 
today (Cui et al., 2011; Bowen et al., 2015; Frieling et al., 2016; Zeebe et al., 2016; Gutjahr et al., 2017; 
Kirtland Turner, 2018; Gingerich, 2019). 
 
<figref>2.29</figref> 
 
Paleo evidence suggests that surface ocean pH has gradually increased over the last 50 Myr (Anagnostou et 
al., 2016; 2020; Sosdian et al., 2018) (Figure 2.29a). Global mean surface pH values as low as observed 
during recent decades are uncommon in the last 2 Myr (Figure 2.29b) (Chalk et al., 2017; Dyez et al., 2018; 
Martínez-Botí et al., 2015a; Sosdian et al., 2018), and have not been experienced in at least the last 25 kyr 
(Figure 2.29c) (Ezat et al., 2017; Foster, 2008; Gray et al., 2018; Henehan et al., 2013; Kirschke et al., 2013; 
Martínez-Botí et al., 2015a; Naik et al., 2015; Palmer et al., 2010; Palmer & Pearson, 2003; Shao et al., 
2019). The magnitude of pH change during the Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles was 0.1–0.15 pH units - similar to recent changes in the modern era (Figure 2.29c) (Hönisch et al., 2009; Chalk et al., 2017; Shao et 
al., 2019) (Section 5.3.1.2). Maximum rates of pH change during the LDT, inferred from changes in 
atmospheric CO₂ recorded in ice cores (Marcott et al., 2014b) and the established relationships between pH 
and CO₂ changes and the boron isotope proxy (Hain et al. 2018), reached -0.02 pH units per century at about 
11.7 ka, about 14.8 ka and about 16.3 ka, as previously sequestered CO₂ was transferred from the ocean 
interior to the subsurface ocean (Jaccard et al., 2016; Martínez-Botí et al., 2015a; Rae et al., 2018). 
 
Since the 1980s, the global ocean has experienced a decline in surface pH of 0.016 ± 0.006 pH units per 
decade based on indirect pH products (Figure 2.29d) (Gehlen et al., 2020; Hurd et al., 2018; IPCC, 2019; 
Lauvset et al., 2015) that agrees with the decline of 0.017–0.025 pH units per decade assessed in SROCC 
from direct time-series measurements of pH. Section 5.3.2.2 assesses a decline that ranges from 0.01 to 
0.026 pH units per decade for the tropical and subtropical open ocean areas, and 0.003–0.026 pH units per 
decade for the polar and subpolar open ocean regions by using time series and ship-based datasets from the 
surface ocean CO₂ measurement network (Bakker et al., 2016; Gehlen et al. 2020; Gregor & Gruber, 2021). 
There is general consensus that global surface ocean pH trends over the past two decades have exceeded the 
natural background variability (Bindoff et al., 2019; Gehlen et al., 2020; Lauvset et al., 2015). However, for 
some areas sparse data coverage, and large year-to-year variations hinders the detection of long-term surface 
ocean pH trends; for example in the Southern Ocean (Bindoff et al., 2019; Lauvset et al., 2015) and in the 
Arctic Ocean (Bindoff et al., 2019; Lauvset et al., 2015; Meredith et al., 2019). 
 
For subsurface pH changes, estimates arise from direct ship measurements from repeated hydrography 
programs (Carter et al., 2019), indirect estimates of pH through calcite and aragonite saturation horizons 
(Osborne et al., 2020; Ross et al., 2020), and the very recent biogeochemical Argo floats equipped with pH 
sensors (Claustre et al., 2020). Global subsurface pH has decreased over the past 20–30 years, with signals 
observed to at least 1000 m depths (Lauvset et al., 2020). Global findings are supplemented by regional 
findings from the Pacific Ocean (Carter et al., 2019; Ross et al., 2020); the South Atlantic (Salt et al., 2015) 
and Southern Ocean (Jones et al., 2017); the North Atlantic Ocean and along the AMOC (Woosley et al., 
2016; Perez et al., 2018), the Arctic Ocean (Qi et al., 2017) and marginal seas (Chen C.-T. A. et al., 2017). 
Further details are given in Section 5.3.3.1. 
 
To conclude, it is virtually certain that surface open ocean pH has declined globally over the last 40 years by 
0.003–0.026 pH per decade, and a decline in the ocean interior has been observed in all ocean basins over the 
past 2–3 decades (high confidence). A long-term increase in surface open ocean pH occurred over the past 50 
Myr (high confidence), and surface open ocean pH as low as recent times is uncommon in the last 2 Myr 
(medium confidence). There is very high confidence that open ocean surface pH is now the lowest it has been 
for at least 26 kyr and current rates of pH change are unprecedented since at least that time.  
 
 
### 2.3.3.6  Ocean deoxygenation 
 
SROCC concluded that there has very likely been a net loss of oxygen over all ocean depths since the 1960s 
linked to global ocean deoxygenation at a range of 0.3–2.0%, and that the oxygen levels in the global upper 
1000 m of the ocean had decreased by 0.5–3.3% during 1970–2010 (medium confidence), alongside an 
expansion of oxygen minimum zones (OMZ) by 3–8%. For the surface ocean (0–100 m) and the thermocline 
at 100–600 m, the very likely range of oxygen decline was assessed to be 0.2–2.1% and 0.7–3.5%, 
respectively. Multidecadal rates of deoxygenation showed variability throughout the water column and 
across ocean basins (high confidence). 
 
Since AR5 evidence for changes in oxygen content based on new proxy reconstructions has increased 
(Anderson et al., 2019; Gottschalk et al., 2016, 2020; Hoogakker et al., 2015, 2018). Paleo records point to 
past periods of reduced oceanic oxygen levels during the late Permian (about 250 Ma), the Jurassic and 
Cretaceous (180–100 Ma), alongside associated global scale disturbances of the global carbon cycle. 
Emerging studies for the Cenozoic Era suggest more stable ocean oxygenation conditions throughout the 
interval on million-year time scales (Wang X. et al., 2016). Sedimentary proxy data indicate, however, that 
the seemingly stable Cenozoic was punctuated by transient, widespread deoxygenation during the PETM 
(Dickson et al., 2012; Winguth et al., 2012; Remmelzwaal et al., 2019), with parts of the ocean reaching 
anoxic levels (Yao et al., 2018) (Section 5.3.1.1). Since the LGM, there was an overall emergence and 
expansion of low-oxygen waters into the ocean intermediate depths as a result of rapid warming and a 
reorganization of the global overturning circulation (Galbraith and Jaccard, 2015). The maximum expansion 
of oxygen-depleted waters during the LDT occurred coincidently with rapid warming in the NH at 14.7–12.9 
ka (Hoogakker et al., 2018; Jaccard & Galbraith, 2012; Moffitt et al., 2015). Deep (> 1500m) ocean oxygen 
levels increased by 100–150 µmol kg-1 since the LGM, reaching modern oxygen levels at about 10 ka 
(Anderson et al., 2019; Gottschalk et al., 2016; Hoogakker et al., 2015) (Section 5.3.1.2).  
 
New findings for ocean oxygen content since SROCC are limited to regional scale assessments. The 
magnitude of change is difficult to compare across regions to arrive at a global assessment due to differences 
in depth range, time period, baseline climatology, methodology, and particularly the use of different units. 
To facilitate comparisons, data are presented as change per decade, and conversions of the SROCC global 
mean percentage of oxygen decline estimates are provided as a loss of 3.2 μmol kg−1 in the upper 1000 m of 
the global ocean (1.93%), and 2.0 μmol kg−1 (0.8 μmol kg−1 per decade) in the upper 1000 m of the global 
ocean (1.93%), and 2.0 μmol kg−1 (0.5 μmol kg−1 per decade) in the entire water column (1.15%) between 
1970 and 2010 (Bindoff et al., 2019). Oxygen change also shows decadal variability (Ito et al., 2016; 
Stramma et al., 2020) that can influence estimates of trends.  
 
Subsurface (100–400 m) oxygen in the California Current system is estimated to have declined by 24  2 
μmol kg−1 (1.0 μmol kg−1 per decade) between 1993 and 2018, a rate similar to the global upper 1000 m 
average (Bindoff et al. 2019). In some locations, however, the magnitude of oxygen loss substantially 
exceeds global averages (Queste et al., 2018; Bronselaer et al., 2020; Cummins and Ross, 2020; Stramma et 
al., 2020). For example, a decline in oxygen content of 11.7 ± 3.5% in the upper 4000 m, including a decline 
of 20.4 ± 7.2% in the upper 1550 m, is reported in the North Pacific over the period 1958–2018 (Cummins 
and Ross, 2020) (equivalent to 2.3 μmol kg−1 per decade in the upper 1550 m and 2.0 μmol kg−1 decade− 1 
throughout the 4000 m water column). In some regions of the Southern Ocean south of 65°S oxygen in the 
upper 2000 m has declined by 60 μmol kg−1 (~52 μmol kg−1 per decade) based on comparisons of 2014–2019 
and 1985–2005 observations (Bronselaer et al., 2020). Within some OMZs regions of the Indian ocean, 
oxygen has declined from 6–12 to < 2 μmol kg−1 between the 1960s and 2015–2016 (Bristow et al., 2017; 
Naqvi et al., 2018; Queste et al., 2018). 
 
Findings since SROCC provide further support that the volume of severely oxygen-depleted water has 
expanded in some locations of the global ocean (Section 5.3.3.2). For example, vertical expansion of low 
oxygen zones is reported in the North Pacific at a rate of 3.1 ± 0.5 m yr<sup>–1</sup> (Ross et al., 2020), and suboxic 
waters have increased by 20% at a rate of about 19 m per decade from 1982–2010 in the Arabian Sea (Naqvi 
et al., 2018; Lachkar et al., 2019), and expanded off the coast of Mexico (Sánchez-Velasco et al., 2019). 
  
In summary, episodes of widespread and long-lasting (100 ka scales) open-ocean deoxygenation were related 
to warm climate intervals of the Permian-Cretaceous, with conditions becoming generally better oxygenated 
as the climate cooled over the course of the Cenozoic (high confidence). The largest expansions of oxygen 
depleted waters over the past 25 ka were strongly linked to rapid warming rates (medium confidence). Open-
ocean deoxygenation has occurred in most regions of the open ocean during the mid- 20th to early 21st 
centuries (high confidence), and shows decadal variability (medium confidence). Evidence further confirms 
SROCC that OMZs are expanding at many locations (high confidence). 
 
 
## 2.3.4  Biosphere 
 
This section is limited to a few biological indicators to demonstrate the close links between the biosphere 
and physical forcing. In selecting the indicators, we focussed on those (i) that are observable at large (global) 
spatial scales and over long (two decades or more) temporal scales, using standardised and consistent 
procedures; and (ii) those that are illustrative of the influence of the physical system on the biological 
realm. Chapters 2 and 3 of WGII AR6 undertake a more holistic assessment of biospheric impacts. 

### 2.3.4.1  Seasonal Cycle of CO₂ 
 
AR5 noted that because CO₂ uptake by photosynthesis occurs only during the growing season, the greater 
land mass in the NH imparts a characteristic ‘sawtooth’ seasonal cycle in atmospheric CO₂. SRCCL 
similarly stated that due to strong seasonal patterns of growth, NH terrestrial ecosystems are largely 
responsible for the seasonal variations in global atmospheric CO₂ concentrations. Neither AR5 nor SRCCL 
made a confidence statement about observed changes in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of CO₂.  
 
In situ observations of CO₂ generally depict a rising amplitude of the seasonal cycle over the past half 
century, especially north of about 45°N (Figure 2.30). For example, an amplitude increase of 6 ± 2.6% per 
decade has been observed at the Barrow surface observatory in Alaska over 1961–2011 (Graven et al., 
2013), with slightly slower increases thereafter. Aircraft data north of 45°N exhibit an amplitude increase of 
57 ± 7% at 500 mb versus an increase of 26 ± 18% for 35°N–45°N between field campaigns in 1958–1961 
and 2009–2011  (Graven et al., 2013b). Increases in amplitude for the period 1980–2012 are apparent at 
eight surface observatories north of 50°N (Piao et al., 2018), related primarily to a larger drawdown in June 
and July. Trends in seasonal cycle amplitude at lower latitudes are smaller (if present at all); for instance, the 
increase at the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii since the early 1960s is only about half as large as at 
Barrow (Graven et al., 2013a), and only one other low-latitude observatory has a significant increase from 
1980–2012 (Piao et al., 2018). There is a weak signal of an increase in amplitude at the Sinhagad 
observatory in western India in recent years (Chakraborty et al., 2020). Generally speaking, larger increases 
in the Arctic and boreal regions are indicative of changes in vegetation and carbon cycle dynamics in 
northern ecosystems (Forkel et al., 2016), though increased carbon uptake can also result from other factors 
such as warmer- and wetter-than-normal conditions.  
 
Recent satellite-based, global-scale estimates of seasonal variations in atmospheric CO₂ for the period 2003–
2018 show that the seasonal variations in the SH are out of phase with those in the NH (Reuter et al., 2020), 
which is consistent with the phenological shifts in primary productivity between hemispheres. The net effect 
of the phase shift between the two hemispheres is to dampen the amplitude of the global average seasonal 
cycle. These integrated results also show that the amplitude of the oscillations has been increasing in the SH, 
from about 2009, but comparison with data from Baring head suggests that periods of high seasonal 
oscillation had occurred at that location in the SH prior to 1995. 
 
<figref>2.30</figref> 
 
In summary, there is very high confidence that the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO₂ has 
increased at mid-to-high NH latitudes since the early 1960s. The observed increase is generally consistent 
with greater greening during the growing season and an increase in the length of the growing season over the 
high northern high latitudes. Similarly, globally-integrated results from the SH also show an increase in 
seasonal amplitude of atmospheric CO₂ signal, from around 2009 to 2018 (low confidence). 
 
 
### 2.3.4.2  Marine biosphere 
 
#### 2.3.4.2.1  Large-scale distribution of marine biota 

SROCC pointed out that long-term global observations of many key ocean variables, including 
phytoplankton, have not reached the density and accuracy necessary for detecting change. But SROCC noted 
the good comparability between short time-scale single-sensor ocean-colour products and a longer time-
scale, climate-quality time series of multi-sensor, inter-sensor-bias-corrected, and error characterised, global 
data on chlorophyll-a concentration in the surface layers of the ocean. With respect to oligotrophic gyres, 
AR5 WGII concluded that the oligotrophic subtropical gyres of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are 
expanding and that they indicate declining phytoplankton stocks in these waters (limited evidence, low 
agreement). With respect to distributions of marine organisms, AR5 WGII reported range shifts of benthic, 
pelagic, and demersal species and communities (high confidence), though the shifts were not uniform.  
 
Phytoplankton are responsible for marine primary production through photosynthesis; they are a major 
player in the ocean carbon cycle. They have a high metabolic rate, and respond fast to changes in 
environmental conditions (light, temperature, nutrients, mixing), and as such, serve as a sentinel for change 
in marine ecosystems. Concentration of chlorophyll-a, the major photosynthetic pigment in all 
phytoplankton, is often used as a measure of phytoplankton biomass. As primary producers, they are also 
food for organisms at higher trophic levels. The multi-sensor time series of chlorophyll-a concentration has 
now been updated (Sathyendranath et al., 2019) to cover 1998–2018. Figure 2.31 shows that global trends in 
chlorophyll-a for the last two decades are insignificant over large areas of the global ocean (von Schuckmann 
et al., 2019), but some regions exhibit significant trends, with positive trends in parts of the Arctic and the 
Antarctic waters (>3% yr<sup>–1</sup>), and both negative and positive trends (within ± 3% yr<sup>–1</sup>) in parts of the tropics, 
subtropics and temperate waters. The interannual variability in chlorophyll-a data in many regions is strongly 
tied to indices of climate variability (Section 2.4, Annex IV) and changes in total concentration are typically 
associated with changes in phytoplankton community structure (e.g., Brewin et al., 2012; Racault et al., 
2017a). Variability in community structure related to El Niño has, in turn, been linked to variability in 
fisheries, for example in the catch of anchovy (Engraulis ringens) in the Humboldt current ecosystem 
(Jackson et al., 2011). 
 
<figref>2.31</figref> 
 
Since AR5 WGII, analysis of a longer time series of ocean-colour data (1998–2012) has shown (Aiken et al., 
2017) that the expansion of the low nutrient part of the North Atlantic oligotrophic gyre was significant, at 
0.27 x 106 km2 per decade, but that the rate was much lower than that reported earlier by Polovina et al. 
(2008). Furthermore, Aiken et al. (2017) reported no significant trend in the oligotrophic area of the South 
Atlantic Gyre. With the time series extended to 2016, von Schuckmann et al. (2018) reported that since 
2007, there was a general decreasing trend in the areas of the North and South Pacific oligotrophic Gyres, 
while the North and South Atlantic oligotrophic Gyres remained stable, with little change in area, consistent 
with Aiken et al. (2017). The changing sign of trends in the areal extent of the oligotrophic gyres with 
increase in the length of the time series raises the possibility that these changes arise from interannual to 
multi-decadal variability. The time series of ocean-colour data is too short to discern any trend that might be 
superimposed on such variability.  
 
Similarly, there is limited consistent and long-term information on large-scale distributions of marine 
organisms at higher trophic levels. But there are increased indications since AR5 and SROCC that the 
distributions of various higher trophic-level organisms are shifting both polewards and to deeper levels 
(Atkinson et al., 2019; Edwards et al., 2016; Haug et al., 2017; Lenoir et al., 2020; Pinsky et al., 2020), 
mostly consistent with changes in temperature. However observations also show a smaller set of counter-
intuitive migrations towards warmer and shallower waters, which could be related to changes in phenology 
and in larval transport by currents (Fuchs et al., 2020). There are also strengthening indications of greater 
representation by species with warm-water affinity in marine communities, consistent with expectations 
under observed warming (Burrows et al., 2019). There are indications that pre-1850 CE plankton 
communities are different from their modern counterparts globally (Jonkers et al., 2019). Indicators of 
geographical distributions of species (mostly from coastal waters) suggest that the rates at which some 
species are leaving or arriving at an ecosystem are variable, leading to changes in community composition 
(Blowes et al. 2019), with likely greater representation of warm-water species in some locations (Burrows et 
al., 2019).  
 
In summary, there is high confidence that the latitudinal and depth limits of the distribution of various 
organisms in the marine biome are changing. There is medium confidence that there are differences in the 
responses of individual species relative to each other, such that the species compositions of ecosystems are 
changing. There is medium confidence that chlorophyll concentration in the surface shows weak negative 
and positive trends in parts of low and mid latitudes, and weak positive trends in some high-latitude areas. 
There is medium confidence that the large-scale distribution of the oligotrophic gyre provinces is subject to 
significant inter-annual variations, but low confidence in the long-term trends in the areal extent of these 
provinces because of insufficient length of direct observations. 
 
 
#### 2.3.4.2.2  Marine Primary production 
SROCC expressed low confidence in satellite-based estimates of trends in marine primary production, citing 
insufficient length of the time series and lack of corroborating in situ measurements and independent 
validation time series. The report also cites significant mismatches in absolute values and decadal trends in 
primary production when different satellite-based products are compared. 
 
Recent model-based results with assimilation of satellite data (Gregg and Rousseaux, 2019), show global 
annual mean marine primary production of around 38 (±1.13) PgC yr<sup>–1</sup> over 1998–2015. This new result lies 
towards the low end of values reported in earlier, satellite-based, studies (range 36.5–67 PgC yr<sup>–1</sup>, reported in 
Sathyendranath et al., 2020). Reconciling the results of Gregg & Rousseaux (2019) with earlier satellite-
based studies leads to a mean of 47 (±7.8) PgC yr<sup>–1</sup>. There is a strong correlation between interannual 
regional variability in marine primary production and climate variability (Gregg & Rousseaux, 2019; Racault 
et al., 2017b). The increase in primary production in the Arctic has been associated with retreating sea ice 
and with increases in nutrient supply and chlorophyll concentration (Lewis et al., 2020). Gregg and 
Rousseaux (2019) reported a decreasing trend in marine primary production, of -0.8 PgC (-2.1%) per decade 
globally. There is low confidence in this trend because of the small number of studies and the short length of 
the time series (<20 years). 
 
In conclusion, there is low confidence because of the small number of recent studies and the insufficient 
length of the time series analysed that marine primary production is 47 (± 7.8) PgC yr<sup>–1</sup>. A small decrease in 
productivity is evident globally for the period 1998–2015, but regional changes are larger and of opposing 
signs (low confidence).  
 
 
#### 2.3.4.2.3  Marine phenology  

Phenology is the study of the timing of important events in the annual life cycle of organisms (plants or 
animals) (see also Annex VII: Glossary). AR5 WGII noted that the timing of various seasonal biological 
events in the ocean had advanced by more than four days per decade over the previous 50-year period and 
concluded that there was high confidence in observed changes in the phenological metrics of marine 
organisms. AR5 WGII further reported that, of those observations that showed a response, 81% of changes 
in phenology, distribution and abundance were consistent with anticipated responses to climate warming 
according to theoretical expectations, corroborated by updates in SROCC. The consequent current and future 
impacts on interactions between species, including competition and predator-prey dynamics, were noted with 
high confidence. 

There are additional indications that phenological metrics related to different species are changing, but not 
always in a similar manner. For example, many seabirds are breeding earlier, while others are breeding later 
(Sydeman et al., 2015). Planktonic organisms in the North Atlantic are also responding differently to each 
other when subjected to the same environmental changes (Edwards & Richardson, 2004). Furthermore, 
different factors could be responsible for triggering phenological responses in different stages in the life 
cycle of a single organism (Koeller et al., 2009). The shift in the distribution of many benthic invertebrates 
on the North-West Atlantic shelf, including some commercially-important shellfish, could be explained by 
phenology and larval transport and the shift and contraction of species range have been associated with 
higher mortality (Fuchs et al., 2020). Changes in phytoplankton phenological indicators globally (Racault et 
al., 2012; Sapiano et al., 2012) have been linked to indicators of climate variability, such as the multivariate 
ENSO Index (Racault et al., 2017a) with responses varying across ecological provinces of the ocean 
(Longhurst, 2007).  
 
Phenological links between multiple components of an ecosystem have to be maintained intact, to retain 
system integrity. Since all higher pelagic organisms depend on phytoplankton for their food, either directly 
or indirectly, a match favours survival, and a mismatch is antagonistic to survival. Match represents 
synchonicity in the phenological events of both prey and predator. There are indications from ocean-colour 
data used in conjunction with fisheries data that the survival rate of various larger marine organisms depends 
on phenological metrics related to the seasonality of phytoplankton growth. Such links have been 
demonstrated, for example, for haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) in the North-West Atlantic (Platt et 
al., 2003); northern shrimp in the North Atlantic (Koeller et al., 2009; Ouellet et al., 2011); sardine 
(Sardinella aurita) off the Ivory coast (Kassi et al., 2018); cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock 
(Melanogrammus aeglefinus) larvae in the North-West Atlantic (Trzcinski et al., 2013); and oil sardine 
(Sardinella longiceps) off the south-west coast of India. Borstad et al. (2011) showed that fledgling 
production rate of rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata) on a remote island in coastal north-eastern 
Pacific was related to seasonal values of chlorophyll-a biomass in the vicinity of the island.  
 
In summary, new in situ data as well as satellite observations strengthen AR5 and SROCC findings that 
various phenological metrics for many species of marine organisms have changed in the last half century 
(high confidence), though many regions and many species of marine organisms remain under-sampled or 
even unsampled. The changes vary with location and with species (high confidence). There is a strong 
dependence of survival in higher trophic-level organisms (fish, exploited invertebrates, birds) on the 
availability of food at various stages in their life cycle, which in turn depends on phenologies of both (high 
confidence). There is a gap in our understanding of how the varied responses of marine organisms to climate 
change, from a phenological perspective, might threaten the stability and integrity of entire ecosystems.  
 
 
### 2.3.4.3  Terrestrial biosphere 
 
#### 2.3.4.3.1  Growing season and phenology changes 
AR5 WGII briefly discussed large-scale changes in the length of the growing season but made no confidence 
statement about observed trends. However, AR5 did conclude with high confidence that warming 
contributed to an overall spring advancement in the NH.  
 
Recent in situ analyses document increases in the length of the thermal growing season (i.e., the period of the 
year when temperatures are warm enough to support growth) over much of the extratropical land surface 
since at least the mid-20th century. Over the NH as a whole, an increase of about 2.0 days per decade is 
evident for 1951–2018 (Dunn et al., 2020), with slightly larger increases north of 45°N (Barichivich et al., 
2013). Over North America, a rise of about 1.3 days per decade is apparent in the United States for 1900–
2014 (Kukal and Irmak, 2018), with larger increases after 1980 (McCabe et al., 2015); likewise, all ecozones 
in Canada experienced increases from 1950–2010 (Pedlar et al., 2015). Growing season length in China 
increased by at least 1.0 days per decade since 1960 (Xia et al., 2018) and by several days per decade in 
South Korea since 1970 (Jung et al., 2015). In general, changes in phenological indicators are consistent with 
the increase in growing season length documented by instrumental data (Parmesan and Hanley, 2015). 
Several long-term, site-specific records illustrate the unusualness of recent phenological changes relative to 
interannual variability; for example, peak bloom dates for cherry blossoms in Kyoto, Japan have occurred 
progressively earlier in the growing season in recent decades, as have grape harvest dates in Beaune, France 
(Figure 2.32). 
 
<figref>2.32</figref>
 
Changes in the length of the photosynthetically active growing season (derived from the Normalised 
Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) are also evident over many land areas since the early 1980s. Increases 
of about 2.0 days per decade are apparent north of 45°N since the early 1980s (centred over mid-latitude 
Eurasia and north-eastern North America), with indications of a reversal to a decline in season length starting 
in the early 2000s (Barichivich et al., 2013; Garonna et al., 2016; Liu Q. et al., 2016; Park et al., 2016; Zhao 
J. et al., 2015). Satellite-based records suggest that most NH regions have experienced both an earlier start 
and a later end to the growing season, a finding supported by ground-based data (Piao et al., 2020). A 
number of studies also capture increases in growing season length over the Canadian Arctic (Chen, 2016), 
Fennoscandia (Hogda et al., 2013), most of Europe (Garonna et al., 2014), and parts of sub-Saharan Africa 
(Vrieling et al., 2013).  
 
The general consistency between in situ and satellite estimates over the NH is noteworthy given that many 
factors independently contribute to uncertainty in observed changes. For example, there is no universally 
accepted definition of growing season length across in situ analyses; some define the growing season as the 
period based on a temperature threshold (e.g., 5°C) whereas others use the frost-free period. Spatial and 
temporal coverage can also affect conclusions based upon in situ studies (Donat et al., 2013). For satellite 
analyses, uncertainties can be related to the satellite datasets themselves (e.g., satellite drift, sensor 
differences, calibration uncertainties, atmospheric effects); and to the methods for determining phenological 
metrics (e.g., start, end, and length of season) (Wang S. et al., 2016).  
 
In summary, based on multiple independent analyses of in situ, satellite, and phenological data, there is high 
confidence that the length of the growing season has increased over much of the extratropical NH since at 
least the mid-20th century. 
 
 
#### 2.3.4.3.2  Terrestrial ecosystems 

AR5 WGII concluded that many terrestrial species have shifted their geographic ranges in recent decades 
(high confidence). Similarly, SRCCL assessed that many land species have experienced range size and 
location changes as well as altered abundances over recent decades (high confidence). SROCC noted that 
species composition and abundance have markedly changed in high mountain ecosystems in recent decades 
(very high confidence). 
 
Paleoclimate reconstructions document large-scale biome shifts from the deep past through the Holocene 
(e.g., Hoogakker et al., 2016). The northernmost location of the treeline is a representative indicator in this 
regard (Figure 2.34). During the MPWP, boreal forest extended to the Arctic coast, with the northernmost 
treeline being about 4° to 10° latitude further north than at present; temperate forests and grasslands were 
also shifted poleward (with reduced tundra extent), while savannahs and woodlands were more expansive in 
Africa and Australia at the expense of deserts (Salzmann et al., 2008, 2013; Sniderman et al, 2016; Andrae et 
al., 2018) (Cross-Chapter Box 2.4 Figure 1b). During the LGM, tundra and steppe expanded whereas forests 
were globally reduced in extent (Binney et al., 2017; Prentice et al., 2000), the northern treeline being about 
17 to 23° latitude south of its present day location in most areas. During the LDT, pervasive ecosystem 
transformations occurred in response to warming and other climatic changes (Nolan et al., 2018; Fordham et 
al., 2020). By the MH, North Africa had experienced a widespread conversion from grasslands to desert 
(Hoelzmann et al., 1998; Prentice et al., 2000; Sha, 2019), and the northernmost treeline had shifted 
poleward again to about 1 to 3° latitude north of its current location (Binney et al., 2009; MacDonald et al., 
2000; Williams et al., 2011). Over the past half century, there has been an increase in the spatial synchrony 
of annual tree growth across all continents that is unprecedented during the past millennium (Manzanedo et 
al., 2020). Elevated rates of vegetation change in the Holocene are consistent with climate variability 
(Shuman et al., 2019), intensified human land use (Fyfe et al., 2015; Marquer et al., 2017c), and resulting 
increased ecosystem novelty (Finsinger et al., 2017; Burke et al., 2019). 
 
Long-term ecological records capture extensive range shifts during the 20th and early 21st centuries (Lenoir 
& Svenning, 2015; Pecl et al., 2017). Research has been most extensive for North America and western 
Eurasia, with fewer studies for central Africa, eastern Asia, South America, Greenland, and Antarctica 
(Lenoir & Svenning, 2015). Most documented changes are toward cooler conditions - i.e., poleward and 
upslope (Lenoir et al., 2008; Harsch et al., 2009; Elmendorf et al., 2015; Parmesan and Hanley, 2015; Evans 
and Brown, 2017). Notably, a large, quasi-global analysis (Chen et al., 2011) estimated that many insect, 
bird, and plant species had shifted by 17 (± 3) km per decade toward higher latitudes and 11 (± 2) m per 
decade toward higher elevations since the mid-20th century, with changes in both the leading and trailing 
edges of species ranges (Rumpf et al., 2018). Over the past century, long-term ecological surveys also show 
that species turnover (i.e., the total number of gains and losses of species within an area) has significantly 
increased across a broad array of ecosystems (Dornelas et al., 2014; 2019), including undisturbed montane 
areas worldwide (Gibson-Reinemer et al., 2015). Despite global losses to biodiversity, however, most local 
assemblages have experienced a change in biodiversity rather than a systematic loss (Pimm et al., 2014). 
With increased species turnover, the novelty of contemporary communities relative to historical baselines 
has risen (Hobbs et al., 2009; Radeloff et al., 2015) due to greater spatial homogenization, mixtures of exotic 
and native species, altered disturbance regimes, and legacies of current or historic land use (Olden and 
Rooney, 2006; Schulte et al., 2007; Thompson et al., 2013; Goring et al., 2016). In general, terrestrial species 
have had lower rates of turnover than marine species (Dornelas et al., 2018; Blowes et al., 2019). 
 
There are exceptions to the general pattern of poleward / upslope migration. For some species, various biotic 
and abiotic factors (such as precipitation and land use) supersede the physiological effects of temperature 
(Vanderwal et al., 2013; Gibson-Reinemer and Rahel, 2015; Ordonez et al., 2016; Scheffers et al., 2016; 
Lenoir et al., 2020). For other species, poleward migration is slower than expectations from the observed 
temperature increases. Trees are one such example because of their long lifespan and gradual maturity 
(Renwick and Rocca, 2015); in fact, poleward advance is only evident at about half of the sites in a large 
global dataset of treeline dynamics for 1900-present (Harsch et al., 2009b). Furthermore, the northernmost 
extent of treeline at present (roughly 73°N) is actually somewhat south of its location in the MH (MacDonald 
et al., 2008) despite an expanding growing season in the extratropical NH since the mid-20th century 
(Section 2.3.4.3.1). 
 
Consistent with species range shifts, SRCCL noted that there have been changes in the geographical 
distribution of climate zones. Poleward shifts in temperate and continental climates are evident across the 
globe over 1950–2010, with decreases in the area (and increases in the average elevation) of polar climates 
(Chan and Wu, 2015). Zonal changes towards higher latitudes in winter plant hardiness regions are apparent 
since the 1970s over the central and eastern United States, with elevational changes also being important in 
the western united states (Daly et al., 2012). A clear northward shift in winter plant hardiness zones is 
detectable across western Canada since 1930, with somewhat lesser changes in the south eastern part of the 
country (McKenney et al., 2014). A northward migration of agro-climate zones is also evident over Europe 
since the mid-1970s (Ceglar et al., 2019). In addition, a shift toward more arid climate zones is apparent in 
some areas, such as the Asian monsoon region (Son and Bae, 2015) as well as parts of South America and 
Africa (Spinoni et al., 2015). 

In summary, there is very high confidence that many terrestrial species have shifted their geographic ranges 
poleward and/or upslope over the past century, with increased rates of species turnover. There is high 
confidence that the geographical distribution of climate zones has shifted in many parts of the world.   
 
 
#### 2.3.4.3.3  Global greening and browning 
AR5 WGII briefly discussed changes in global vegetation greenness derived from satellite proxies for 
photosynthetic activity. Observed trends varied in their strength and consistency, and AR5 thus made no 
confidence statement on observed changes. SRCCL subsequently concluded that greening had increased 
globally over the past 2–3 decades (high confidence). 
 
Vegetation index data derived from AVHRR and MODIS depicts increases in aspects of vegetation 
greenness (i.e., green leaf area and/or mass) over the past four decades (Piao et al., 2020). NDVI increased 
globally from the early 1980s through the early 2010s (Liu et al., 2015c). Pan et al. (2018a) found NDVI 
increases over about 70% of the Earth’s vegetated surface through 2013, and Osborne et al. (2018) noted 
strong upward changes in NDVI in the circumpolar Arctic through 2016. Globally integrated Leaf Area 
Index (LAI) also rose from the early 1980s through at least the early 2010s (Zhu et al., 2016; Forzieri et al., 
2017; Jiang et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2017) and probably through near-present; for example, Chen et al. 
(2019) documented an LAI increase over one-third of the global vegetated area from 2000–2017. Although 
less frequently analysed for temporal trends, Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation 
(FAPAR) likewise increased over many global land areas (particularly China, India, and Eastern Europe) in 
the past two decades (Figure 2.33) (Forkel et al., 2014; Gobron, 2018; Keenan & Riley, 2018). There are also 
documented changes in specific vegetation types, such as a 7% rise in global tree cover for 1982–2016 (Song 
et al., 2018) and an expansion of shrub extent in the Arctic tundra over 1982–2017 (Myers-Smith et al., 
2020). The increased greening is largely consistent with CO₂ fertilization at the global scale, with other 
changes being noteworthy at the regional level (Piao et al., 2020); examples include agricultural 
intensification in China and India (Chen et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2019) and temperature increases in the 
northern high latitudes (Kong et al., 2017; Keenan and Riley, 2018) and in other areas such as the Loess 
Plateau in central China (Wang et al., 2018). Notably, some areas (such as parts of Amazonia, central Asia, 
and the Congo basin) have experienced browning (i.e., decreases in green leaf area and/or mass) (Anderson 
et al., 2019; Gottschalk et al., 2016; Hoogakker et al., 2015). Because rates of browning have exceeded rates 
of greening in some regions since the late 1990s, the increase in global greening has been somewhat slower 
in the last two decades (Pan et al., 2018a).  
 
<figref>2.33</figref> 
 
Global-scale linear trends differ substantially across products for the same periods and trend metrics used 
(Jiang et al., 2017). Several factors contribute to this large span in estimated changes. Remotely sensed 
vegetation products vary in their spatial and temporal completeness as well as resolution and are sensitive to 
contamination from atmospheric composition, clouds, snow cover, and anisotropy, as well as orbital changes 
and sensor degradations (de Jong et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2017; Pan et al., 
2018a). Ground-based measurements suitable for calibration and validation are scarce before 2000 (Xiao et 
al., 2017), and the recalibration of satellite records (e.g., as in from MODIS Collection 5 to 6) can affect 
trends (Piao et al., 2020). It is possible that the increase in greenness over 2000–2015 is larger than the 
increase in gross primary production (based on flux tower measurements and MODIS Collection 6 data) 
(Zhang L. et al., 2018). Land use changes and altered disturbance regimes (e.g. floods, fires, diseases) may 
mask large-scale signals (Franklin et al., 2016). In addition, there is a plethora of models for the 
identification of phenological metrics from satellite data as well as a variety of statistical techniques for 
analysing historical changes (Wang et al., 2016). 
 
In summary, there is high confidence that vegetation greenness (i.e., green leaf area and/or mass) has 
increased globally since the early 1980s. However, there is low confidence in the magnitude of this increase 
owing to the large range in available estimates. 
 
 
## 2.3.5  Synthesis of evidence for past changes 
 
Section 2.3 has assessed the observational evidence for changes in key indicators across the atmosphere, 
cryosphere, ocean and biosphere starting, where applicable, from paleoclimate proxy records and coming up 
to the present day. This synthesis serves as an assessment of the evidence for change across the climate 
system as represented by the instrumental record and its unusualness in the longer-term context. Building 
upon previous sections assessing the observational evidence for each key indicator individually, this section 
integrates the evidence across multiple indicators to arrive at a holistic and robust final assessment. 
 
Climate has varied across a broad range of timescales (Figure 2.34). During the Cenozoic Era temperatures 
generally decreased over tens of millions of years, leading to the development of ice sheets. During the last 
two million years, climate has fluctuated between glacials and interglacials. Within the current Holocene 
interglacial and, with increasing detail in the CE, it is possible to reconstruct a history both of more 
indicators of the climate system and, with increasing fidelity, the rates of change. Solely for the last 150 
years or so are instrumental observations of globally distributed climate indicators available. However, only 
since the late 20th century have observational systems attained essentially global monitoring capabilities. 
The direct observations point unequivocally to rapid change across many indicators of the climate system 
since the mid-19th century. These are all consistent in indicating a world that has warmed rapidly.  
 
Assessing the long-term context of recent changes is key to understanding their potential importance and 
implications. The climate system consists of many observable aspects that vary over a very broad range of 
timescales. Some biogeochemical indicators of change such as atmospheric CO₂ concentrations and ocean 
pH have shifted rapidly and CO₂ concentrations are currently at levels unseen in at least 800 kyr (the period 
of continuous polar ice-core records) and very likely for millions of years. The GMST in the past decade is 
likely warmer than it has been on a centennially-averaged basis in the CE and more likely than not since the 
peak of the LIG. Many more integrative components of the climate system (e.g., glaciers, GMSL) are 
experiencing conditions unseen in millennia, whereas the most slowly responding components (e.g. ice-sheet 
extent, permafrost, tree line) are at levels unseen in centuries (high confidence). The rate at which several 
assessed climate indicators (e.g., GMSL, OHC, GSAT) have changed over recent decades is highly unusual 
in the context of preceding slower changes during the current post-glacial period (high confidence). 
 
In summary, directly observed changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere are unequivocal 
evidence of a warming world. Key climate indicators are now at levels not experienced for centuries to 
millennia. Since the late 19th century many indicators of the global climate system have changed at a rate 
unprecedented over at least the last two thousand years.

# 2.4  Changes in modes of variability 
 
Modes of climate variability that are important for large-scale climate on interannual and longer timescales 
(Cross-Chapter Box 2.2) are assessed herein and defined and summarised in Annex IV. Though the modes of 
variability discussed here are assessed and classified on the basis of physical variables, it is important to 
recognise that the distribution and function of various components of the terrestrial and marine biospheres 
are modified in response to them.  
 
 
## 2.4.1  Annular modes  
 
### 2.4.1.1  Northern Annular Mode (NAM) / North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) 
 
AR5 reported that the shift towards a positive NAO, a mode of variability in the North Atlantic that is 
closely related to the hemispheric-scale NAM, from the 1950s to the 1990s was largely reversed by more 
recent changes (high confidence). Moreover, periods of persistent negative or positive NAO states observed 
during the latter part of the 20th century were not unusual, based on NAO reconstructions spanning the last 
half millennium (high confidence). 
 
New multi-millennial-timescale NAO reconstructions are derived from marine and lake sediments, 
speleothems, tree rings and ice cores (Ortega et al., 2015; Faust et al., 2016; Sjolte et al., 2018). NAO 
variability over the past 8 kyr suggests the presence of a significant 1.5 kyr periodicity (Darby et al., 2012). 
Positive NAO conditions dominated during the MH, while the prevailing NAO sign during the early and late 
Holocene was negative according to most reconstructions (Brahim et al., 2019; Hernández et al., 2020; Olsen 
et al., 2012; Røthe et al., 2019). For the CE, reconstructions developed since AR5 indicate no dominant 
NAO phase during 1000–1300 CE (Baker et al., 2015; Hernández et al., 2020; Jones et al., 2014; Lasher & 
Axford, 2019; Ortega et al., 2015), with either negative (Baker et al., 2015; Faust et al., 2016; Mellado-Cano 
et al., 2019) or a more variable phase of the NAO (Jones et al., 2014; Ortega et al., 2015; Sjolte et al., 2018; 
Cook et al., 2019) between 1400 and 1850 CE. Several instrument-based NAO reconstructions extending 
back to the 17th and 18th centuries highlight the presence of multidecadal variations in the NAO phases 
(Cornes et al., 2013; Cropper et al., 2015), although these studies have limitations considering the seasonality 
of the centres of action and the locations of the stations used. Recent reconstructions of the large scale sea 
level pressure field yield more robust NAO analysis, showing a persistently negative NAO phase from the 
1820s to the 1870s, with positive values dominating during the beginning of the 20th century followed by a 
declining trend over 1920–1970, with a recovery thereafter to a period of consistently high values between 
1970 and the early 1990s (Delaygue et al., 2019; Mellado-Cano et al., 2019). Based on the evaluation of 
several NAO reconstructions for recent centuries, Hernández et al. (2020) highlighted that the strong positive 
NAO phases of the 1990s and early 21st century were not unusual.  
 
The predominantly positive phase during the 1990s was followed by partial reversal and a tendency towards 
stronger variability in boreal winter NAM and NAO since the late 1990s (Hanna et al., 2018; Pinto & Raible, 
2012). This is particularly evident in December NAO (Hanna et al., 2015) and NAM (Overland and Wang, 
2015) indices, and is not unusual on multidecadal time scales (Woollings et al., 2018a). Since the 1990s, a 
statistically significant summer NAO decline was reported, which is, to a lesser extent, also evident in the 
winter NAO, linked to an enhanced blocking activity over Greenland (Hanna et al., 2015; 2016; Wachowicz 
et al., 2021). However, this was moderated by a persistent positive NAO values since 2015 (Annex IV 2.1). 
Based on observations and reanalysis datasets, multidecadal fluctuations were found for the NAM patterns: 
the Atlantic centre remained unchanged throughout 1920–2010, whereas the Pacific centre was stronger 
during 1920–1959 and 1986–2010 and weaker during 1960–1985 (Gong et al., 2018). Multidecadal changes 
were also observed in the position of the centres of action of the NAO (Moore et al., 2013; Zuo et al., 2016).  
 
In summary, positive trends for the NAM / NAO winter indices were observed between the 1960s and the 
early 1990s, but these indices have become less positive or even negative thereafter (high confidence). The 
NAO variability in the instrumental record was very likely not unusual in the millennial and multi-centennial 
context. 
 
 
### 2.4.1.2  Southern Annular Mode (SAM) 
 
AR5 concluded that it was likely that the SAM had become more positive since the 1950s and that this 
increase was unusual in the context of the prior 400 years (medium confidence). Both AR5 and SROCC 
reported statistically significant trends in the SAM during the instrumental period for the austral summer and 
autumn.  
 
Several studies have attempted to reconstruct the evolution of the SAM during the Holocene using proxies of 
the position and strength of the zonal winds, although with no clear consensus regarding the timing and 
phase of the SAM (Hernández et al., 2020). The early Holocene was dominated by SAM positive phases 
(Moreno et al., 2018; Reynhout et al., 2019), consistent with increasing westerly wind strength (Lamy et al., 
2010), with some reconstructions showing significant centennial and millennial variability but no consistent 
trend after 5 ka (Hernández et al., 2020). For the CE, enhanced westerly winds occurred over 0–1000 CE, as 
reflected in increased burning activity in Patagonia (Turney et al., 2016a) and tree ring records from southern 
New Zealand (Turney et al., 2016b), imply a predominantly positive SAM phase. Pollen records and lake 
sediments from Tasmania, southern mainland Australia, New Zealand and southern South America, inferred 
the period of 1000 to 1400 CE to be characterized by anomalously dry conditions south of 40°S, implying a 
positive SAM (Evans et al., 2019; Fletcher et al., 2018; Matley et al., 2020; Moreno et al., 2014). 
Nevertheless, proxy reconstructions of the SAM based on temperature-sensitive records from tree rings, ice 
cores, lake sediments and corals spanning the mid-to-polar latitudes show altering positive and negative 
phases (Figure 2.35). 
 
Prolonged periods of negative SAM values were identified during the period 1400–1700 CE in several 
reconstructions (Figure 2.35, Abram et al., 2014; Dätwyler et al., 2018; Villalba et al., 2012), with a 
minimum identified during the 15th century (Hernández et al., 2020), although some disagreements exist 
between proxy records before 1800 CE (Hessl et al., 2017). Abram et al. (2014) concluded that the mean 
SAM index during recent decades is at its highest levels for at least the last 1 kyr. Similarly, the summer 
SAM reconstruction by Dätwyler et al. (2018) indicates a strengthening over the last 60 years that is outside 
the very likely range of the last millennium natural variability. The largest 30- and 50-year trends in the 
annual SAM index occurred at the end of the 20th century (after 1969 and 1950 respectively), indicating that 
the recent increase in the SAM is unprecedented in the context of at least the past three centuries (Yang & 
Xiao, 2018).  
 
Before the mid-1950s, SAM indices derived from station-based datasets, and centennial reanalyses show 
pronounced interannual and decadal variability but no significant trends, with low correlation between SAM 
indices due to the diversity across different datasets and sensitivity to the definition used for the index 
calculation (Barrucand et al., 2018; Lee J. et al., 2019a; Schneider & Fogt, 2018). Various SAM indices 
exhibit significant positive trends since the 1950s, particularly during austral summer and autumn 
(Barrucand et al., 2018; Lee J. et al., 2019a; Schneider & Fogt, 2018), unprecedented for austral summer 
over the last 150 years (Fogt & Marshall, 2020; Jones et al., 2016b). This indicates a strengthening of the 
surface westerly winds around Antarctica, related to both the position and intensity of the subpolar jet in the 
SH (IPCC, 2019b; Ivy et al., 2017) (Section 2.3.1.4.3). The SAM trends have slightly weakened after about 
2000 (Fogt and Marshall, 2020). 
 
<figref>2.35</figref> 
 
In summary, historical station-based reconstructions of the SAM show that there has been a robust positive 
trend in the SAM index, particularly since 1950 and for the austral summer (high confidence). The recent 
positive trend in the SAM is likely unprecedented in at least the past millennium, although medium 
confidence arises due to the differences between proxy records before 1800 CE. 
 
 
## 2.4.2  El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) 
 
AR5 reported with medium confidence that ENSO-like variability existed, at least sporadically, during the 
warm background state of the Pliocene. It was also found (high confidence) that ENSO has remained highly 
variable during the last 7 kyr with no discernible orbital modulation. AR5 concluded that large variability on 
interannual to decadal timescales, and differences between datasets, precluded robust conclusions on any 
changes in ENSO during the instrumental period. SROCC reported epochs of strong ENSO variability 
throughout the Holocene, with no indications of a systematic trend in ENSO amplitude, but with some 
indication that the ENSO amplitude over 1979–2009 was greater than at any point in the period from 1590–
1880 CE. It was also reported that the frequency and intensity of El Niño events in the period from 1951–
2000 was high relative to 1901–1950.  
 
Manucharyan and Fedorov (2014) found that ENSO-like variability has been present, at least sporadically, 
during epochs of millions of years (including the MPWP; Cross-Chapter Box 2.4), with proxy records 
indicating that this was the case even when cross-Pacific SST gradients were much weaker than present. 
There is substantial disagreement between proxy records for ENSO activity during the early Holocene 
(White et al., 2018;  Zhang et al., 2014), and for ENSO activity and mean state at the LGM (Ford et al., 
2015,2018; Koutavas & Joanides, 2012; Leduc et al., 2009; Sadekov et al., 2013; Tierney et al., 2020; Zhu et 
al., 2017). A number of studies (Carré et al., 2014; Cobb et al., 2013; Emile-Geay et al., 2016; Grothe et al., 
2019; McGregor H. et al., 2013; Thompson et al., 2017; Tian et al., 2017; White et al., 2018) have found that 
ENSO was substantially weaker than at present at various times in the mid-Holocene within the period from 
6 to 3 ka, with stronger decreases in variability revealed by remote proxies than by those close to the core 
region of ENSO activity. However, Karamperidou et al. (2015) find that weakening in ENSO-related 
variability in eastern Pacific proxies does not necessarily correspond to weakening in central Pacific proxies. 
Barrett et al. (2018) concluded that multi-proxy reconstructions are more efficient at identifying eastern 
Pacific than central Pacific events. This suggests that a weakening of proxy-based signals may indicate an 
along-equatorial shift in ENSO activity rather than a weakening of ENSO during some periods. Following 
the period of weak ENSO variability in the mid-Holocene, a number of studies find an increase in ENSO 
activity which, depending upon the study, commences between 4.4 and 3 ka (Chen et al., 2016; Cobb et al., 
2013; Du et al., 2021; Emile-Geay et al., 2016; Koutavas & Joanides, 2012; Thompson et al., 2017; Zhang et 
al., 2014).  
 
Numerous studies (Hope et al., 2017; Li J. et al., 2013; Liu Y. et al., 2017; McGregor S. et al., 2013; Rustic 
et al., 2015) find substantial variability in ENSO activity on multi-decadal to centennial timescales over the 
last 500 to 1 kyr (Figure 2.36). Different proxies show a wide spread in the specific timing and magnitude of 
events in the pre-instrumental period (e.g. Dätwyler et al., 2019). Most investigators find that ENSO activity 
in recent decades was higher than the most recent centuries prior to the instrumental period. Grothe et al. 
(2019) also found that ENSO variance of the last 50 years was 25% higher than the average of the last 
millennium, and was substantially higher than the average of the mid- to late Holocene. McGregor S. et al., 
(2010, 2013) looked for common variance changes in pre-existing ENSO proxies, finding stronger ENSO 
variance for the 30-year period 1979–2009 compared to any 30-year period within the timespan 1590–1880 
CE. This finding also holds when adding more recently developed ENSO proxies (Figure 2.36).  
Koutavas & Joanides (2012), Ledru et al. (2013) and Thompson et al., (2017) identify various periods within 
the range 1000 BCE to 1300 CE when ENSO activity was greater than in the following centuries, and more 
closely comparable to the mid-20th century onwards behaviour. 
 
<figref>2.36</figref>
 
Since AR5, updates to datasets used widely in prior ENSO assessments resulted in substantial and important 
revisions to observed tropical Pacific SST data (Section 2.3.1.1). In particular, ERSSTv4, and then 
ERSSTv5, addressed known SST biases in ERSSTv3 in the equatorial Pacific which affected the derived 
mean state and amplitude of indices based on that dataset (Huang et al., 2015). During the instrumental 
period, there is no robust indication of any significant century-scale trend in the east-west SST gradient 
across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, with periods when gradients have been stronger and weaker than the 
long-term average on decadal timescales, associated with a predominance of La Niña or El Niño events 
respectively. The frequency of El Niño and La Niña events is also subject to considerable decadal variability 
(e.g. Hu et al., 2013) but with no indication of a long-term signal in the frequency of events. The ENSO 
amplitude since 1950 has increased relative to the 1910–1950 period, as confirmed by independent proxy 
records (e.g., Gergis & Fowler, 2009), the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) (Braganza et al., 2009) and 
SSTs (e.g., Ohba, 2013; Yu & Kim, 2013), although there is a spread between different proxy and 
instrumental sources as to the magnitude of that increase (Figure 2.36). The El Niño events of 1982–1983, 
1997–1998 and 2015–2016 had the strongest anomalies in the Niño 3.4 SST index since 1950. Their 
predominance was less evident from indices based on de-trended data such as the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) 
(which still ranked them as the three strongest events since 1950, but only by a small margin), and in the 
SOI. Huang B. et al. (2019d) also note that analyses based upon buoy and Argo data, which are only 
available since the 1990s, are more capable of resolving strong events than analyses which do not include 
such data. 
 
Prior to the 1950s, SST observations in the tropical Pacific were much sparser and hence uncertainties in 
Niño indices are much larger (Huang B. et al., 2020). SOI data and some newer SST-based studies show 
high ENSO amplitude, comparable to the post-1950 period, in the period from the mid-late 19th century to 
about 1910, but proxy indicators generally indicate that the late 19th and early 20th century were less active 
than the late 20th century (Figure 2.36). Yu & Kim's (2013) implementation of the ONI found a number of 
events with the ONI above 1.5°C between 1888 and 1905, then no such events until 1972, whilst the SOI 
indicates comparable or stronger events to the three strongest post-1950 events in 1896 and 1905. Giese & 
Ray (2011) also found a number of such events between 1890 and 1920 in the SODA ocean reanalysis, 
corroborated further by Huang B. et al. (2020a) and Vaccaro et al. (2021), who found that the strength of the 
1877–1878 event was comparable with that of the 1982–1983, 1997–1998 and 2015–2016 events. There 
have also been a number of strong La Niña events (e.g. 1973–1974, 1975–1976 and 2010–2011), with few 
clear analogues in the 1920–1970 period; the proxy-based analysis of McGregor et al. (2010) indicates that 
the mid-1970s La Niña period was also extreme in a multi-centennial context. There is no indication that the 
frequency of high-amplitude events since the 1970s reflects a long-term trend which can be separated from 
multi-decadal variability, given apparent presence of several high-amplitude events in the late 19th and early 
20th centuries, and the relatively large uncertainty in pre-1950 SST data in the tropical Pacific region.  
 
There is a distinction (Annex IV 2.3.1) between El Niño events centred in the eastern Pacific (‘Eastern 
Pacific’ (EP) or ‘classical’ events) and those centred in the Central Pacific (‘Central Pacific’ (CP) or 
‘Modoki’ events), which have different typical teleconnections (e.g. Ashok et al., 2007; Capotondi et al., 
2015; Ratnam et al., 2014; Timmermann et al., 2018). A number of studies, using a range of indicators, have 
found an increase in recent decades of the fraction of CP El Niño events, particularly after 2000 (Yu and 
Kim, 2013; Lübbecke and McPhaden, 2014; Pascolini-Campbell et al., 2015; Jiang and Zhu, 2018). Johnson 
(2013) found that the frequency of CP El Niño events had increased (although not significantly) over the 
1950–2011 period, being accompanied by a significant increase in the frequency of La Niña events with a 
warm (as opposed to cool) western Pacific warm pool. A coral-based reconstruction starting in 1600 CE 
(Freund et al., 2019) found that the ratio of CP to EP events in the last 30 years was substantially higher than 
at any other time over the last 400 years. Variations in the proportion of CP and EP events have also been 
found in earlier periods, with Carré et al. (Carré et al., 2014) finding a period of high CP activity around 7 
ka. 
 
There is no robust indication of any changes in ENSO teleconnections over multi-centennial timescales 
(Hernández et al., 2020) despite multi-decadal variability. Shi and Wang (2018) found that teleconnections 
with the broader Asian summer monsoon, including the Indian and the East Asian monsoon, were generally 
stable since the 17th century during the developing phase of the monsoon, and showed substantial decadal 
variability, but no clear trend, during the decaying phase. They also found that the weakening of 
teleconnections between the Indian summer monsoon and ENSO in recent decades had numerous precedents 
over the last few centuries. Räsänen et al. (2016) also found substantial decadal variability, but little trend, in 
the strength of the relationship between ENSO and monsoon precipitation in South-East Asia between 1650 
and 2000. Dätwyler et al., (2019) identified a number of multi-decadal periods with apparently changed 
teleconnections at times over the last 400 years.  
  
In the instrumental period, teleconnections associated with ENSO are well known to vary on decadal to 
multi-decadal timescales (e.g. Ashcroft et al., 2016; He et al., 2013; Jin et al., 2016; Lee & Ha, 2015; Wang 
Q. et al., 2019). Yun and Timmermann (2018) found that decadal variations in teleconnections between 
ENSO and the Indian monsoon did not extend beyond what would be expected from a stochastic process. 
Many observed decadal changes in teleconnections in the instrumental period are consistent with a shift to 
more central Pacific El Niño events (Evtushevsky et al., 2018; Yeh et al., 2018; Yu & Sun, 2018; Zhao & 
Wang, 2019). Effects of the PDV (Kwon et al. 2013; Wang S. et al., 2014; Dong et al., 2018) and the AMV 
(Kayano et al., 2019) can also modulate ENSO teleconnections, and affect the frequency of CP versus EP 
events (Ashok et al., 2007). Chiodi and Harrison (2015) found that teleconnections over the most recent 
decades are broadly consistent with those over the last 100 years. Variability in teleconnections can also 
occur on timescales longer than characteristic PDV timescales (e.g. Gallant et al., 2013).  
 
In summary, there is medium confidence that both ENSO amplitude and the frequency of high-magnitude 
events since 1950 are higher than over the period from 1850 as far back as 1400, but low confidence that 
they are outside the range of variability over periods prior to 1400, or higher than the average of the 
Holocene as a whole. Overall, there is no indication of a recent sustained shift in ENSO or associated 
features such as the Walker Circulation, or in teleconnections associated with these, being beyond the range 
of variability on decadal to millennial timescales. A high proportion of El Niño events in the last 20–30 years 
has been based in the central, rather than eastern Pacific, but there is low confidence that this represents a 
long-term change.  
 
 
## 2.4.3 Indian Ocean Basin and dipole modes 
 
AR5 did not provide an assessment of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) records based on paleo 
reconstructions. For the instrumental era, AR5 reported that there were no trends in the IOD behaviour. 
However, the strength of the Indian Ocean Basin-wide (IOB) mode, quantified by the basin-scale averaged 
SST index, increased in all assessed periods except 1979–2012, but the AR5 neither quantified trends nor 
provided a confidence statement.  
 
For the LGM, enhanced equatorial Indian Ocean productivity in marine sediment records was associated 
with strengthened westerly jets, in line with a shallower central-western Indian Ocean thermocline and 
stronger negative IOD events (Punyu et al., 2014). The LGM Indian Ocean basin was substantially modified 
by the exposure of the tropical shelves (DiNezio et al., 2018) and this has been associated with an Indian 
Ocean "El Niño" (Thirumalai et al., 2019). Wurtzel et al. (2018) contend that during the LDT, including the 

Younger Dryas event, Indian Ocean precipitation did not mirror the zonal asymmetry observed in Indian 
Ocean SSTs in the Holocene based upon a speleothem record from Sumatra, but instead reflected shifts in 
moisture transport pathways and sources. Using Seychelles corals, representing the western pole of the IOD, 
spanning from the MH to present, Zinke et al. (2014) identified changes in seasonality, with the lowest 
seasonal SST range in the MH and then again around 2 ka, while the largest seasonal range occurred around 
4.6 ka and then again during the near-present (1990–2003). Reconstructions from fossil corals for the eastern 
Indian Ocean point to stronger negative IOD SST anomalies due to the enhanced upwelling and cooling 
driven by a stronger monsoon with enhanced anomalous easterly winds in the eastern Indian Ocean during 
the MH (Abram et al., 2020a). Niedermeyer et al. (2014) from the analysis of stable isotopes in terrestrial 
plant waxes, suggest that the period 6.5 ka to 4.5 ka was characterized by an anomalously positive IOD mean 
state. During various parts of the Holocene, periods of a mean positive IOD-like state were associated with 
increased IOD variability, including events that exceed the magnitude of the strongest events during the 
instrumental period (Abram et al., 2020b). 
 
From the coral δ18O record from the Seychelles over 1854–1994, Du et al. (2014) showed a 3–7 year 
dominant period associated with the IOB in response to ENSO forcing. They identified multi-decadal 
variability in the IOB, with more active IOB phases during 1870–1890, 1930–1955, and 1975–1992, while 
decadal variability in the IOB dominated during 1940–1975 (Du Y. et al., 2014). Evidence for changes in 
IOB characteristics during earlier periods (e.g., MH, LGM) is limited.  
  
The role of decadal to multi-decadal variability has recently emerged as an important aspect of the IOD with 
many indications of the effects of Pacific Ocean processes on IOD variability through atmospheric and 
oceanic mechanisms (Dong et al., 2016; Jin et al., 2018; Krishnamurthy & Krishnamurthy, 2016; Zhou et al., 
2017). Positive events in the 1960s and 1990s were linked to a relatively shallow eastern Indian Ocean 
thermocline, and a primarily negative IOD state in the 1970s and 1980s was related to a deeper thermocline 
(Ummenhofer et al., 2016). Positive IOD events may have increased in frequency during the second half of 
the 20th century (Abram et al., 2020a,b). Earlier observations of apparent changes in the frequency and / or 
magnitude of the IOD events are considered unreliable, particularly prior to the 1960s (Hernández et al., 
2020). Although the seasonal evolution and the type of ENSO (Section 2.4.2) may influence the character of 
the IOD (Guo et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015; Fan et al., 2016), the occurrence of some IOD events may be 
independent of ENSO (Sun et al., 2015).  
 
To summarize, there is low confidence in any multi-decadal IOD variability trend in the instrumental period 
due to data uncertainty especially before the 1960s. In addition to data uncertainty, understanding of the IOB 
variability during the instrumental period is also limited by large-scale warming of the Indian Ocean. Neither 
the IOD nor the IOB have exhibited behaviour outside the range implied by proxy records (low confidence).

## 2.4.4  Atlantic Meridional and Zonal Modes 
 
AR5 reported no changes in the Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM) during the 20th century or shorter periods 
thereof. For the Atlantic Zonal Mode (AZM), also referred as the Atlantic Niño, the AR5 reported increases 
during the 1950–2012 period but neither assessed trends nor provided a confidence statement. The AR5 did 
not assess paleo evidence for the AZM and AMM. 
 
Paleo-reconstructions of these two modes remain rather limited. Nonetheless, the interhemispheric cross-
equatorial SST gradients linked to changes in ITCZ locations characteristic of the AMM has been found 
during the LGM,  Heinrich Stadial 1 and the MH, with the largest shift occurring during HS1 (McGee et al., 
2014). Similarly, the dipole-like SST pattern in the South Atlantic subtropics, which is related to the AZM 
(Foltz et al., 2019; Lübbecke et al., 2018; Morioka et al., 2011; Nnamchi et al., 2016, 2017; Rouault et al., 
2018; Venegas et al., 1996), has been reconstructed using SST proxies from marine sediment cores during 
the past 12 kyr (Wainer et al., 2014). The reconstructed index captures two significant cold events that 
occurred during the 12.9–11.6 ka and 8.6–8.0 ka periods in the South Atlantic (Wainer et al., 2014).  
 
During the observational period the AZM and AMM (Figure 2.37) are related to the AMV largely 
controlling the interhemispheric gradient of the SST at decadal to multi-decadal timescales (Li et al., 2015; 
Lübbecke et al., 2018; Polo et al., 2013; Svendsen et al., 2014; Tokinaga & Xie, 2011). The AZM 
interannual variability is enhanced (Foltz et al., 2019; Lübbecke et al., 2018), and is more strongly related to 
ENSO during the negative phase of the AMV (Martín-Rey et al., 2014, 2018; Polo et al., 2015; Nnamchi et 
al., 2020). The AZM displayed a persistent weakened variability over the 1960–2009 period associated with 
declined cold tongue upwelling (Tokinaga and Xie, 2011), which became pronounced since 2000 (Prigent et 
al., 2020a,b). Despite these multi-decadal fluctuations, there is limited evidence for any sustained change in 
the AMM (Chang et al., 2011; Martín-Rey et al., 2018) and AZM (Martín-Rey et al., 2018; Nnamchi et al., 
2020) during the instrumental period. The AZM and AMM interact on interannual timescales (Foltz & 
McPhaden, 2010; Pottapinjara et al., 2019; Servain et al., 1999) leading in 2009 to extremes of both modes 
in which the negative phase of the AMM (Burmeister et al., 2016) (Foltz et al., 2012) preceded an equatorial 
cold tongue cold event that was unprecedented in the prior 30 years (Burmeister et al., 2016; Foltz & 
McPhaden, 2010). 
 
In summary, confidence is low in any sustained changes to the AZM and AMM variability in instrumental 
observations. There is very low confidence in changes of the paleo AZM and AMM due to extremely limited 
availability of paleo reconstructions. 
 
 
## 2.4.5  Pacific Decadal Variability 
 
Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV) refers to the ocean-atmosphere climate variability over the Pacific Ocean 
at decadal-to-interdecadal time scales and is usually described by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) or 
the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) indices. AR5 and SROCC reported a large shift of the PDO in the 
late 1970s, with a predominantly positive phase until the end of the 1990s, being mainly negative afterwards. 
There was no significant change assessed in the PDO during the instrumental period as a whole, and no 
confidence level was assigned. Changes in the pre-instrumental era PDO were not assessed in AR5.  
 
The existence of the PDV in the centuries prior to the instrumental period is evidenced by a variety of proxy 
records based on tree rings (Biondi et al., 2001; D’Arrigo and Ummenhofer, 2015), corals (Deng et al., 2013; 
Felis et al., 2010; Linsley et al., 2015) and sediments (Lapointe et al., 2017; O’Mara et al., 2019). There is 
little coherence between the various paleo-proxy indices prior to the instrumental record, and neither these 
nor the instrumental records provide indications of a clearly defined spectral peak (Buckley et al., 2019; 
Chen & Wallace, 2015; Henley, 2017; Newman M. et al., 2016; Zhang L. et al., 2018). For instance, spectral 
analysis from millennia length PDV reconstructions shows spectral peaks at multi-decadal, centennial and 
bi-centennial time scales (Beaufort and Grelaud, 2017), while only multi-decadal oscillations can be detected 
in the shorter (less than 400 years into the past) paleoclimate reconstructions. A variety of proxies suggest a 
shift in the PDV from the early-mid Holocene, which was characterized by a persistently negative phase of 
the PDO (i.e. weak Aleutian Low), to the late Holocene, and a more variable and more positive PDO (i.e. 
strong Aleutian Low) conditions. This shift at around 4.5 ka is also evident in the PDO periodicities, 
changing from bidecadal and pentadecadal variability in the early Holocene to only pentadecadal 
periodicities in the late Holocene (Hernández et al., 2020). Several proxy records indicate that the 
strengthening in the Aleutian Low inferred since the late 17th century is unprecedented over the last 
millennium (Liu Z. et al., 2017; Osterberg et al., 2017; Winski et al., 2017), in line with an increase in PDV 
low-frequency variability (Hernández et al., 2020; Williams et al., 2017). 

The PDO and IPO indices are significantly correlated during the instrumental period, showing regime shifts 
in the 1920s, 1940s, 1970s and around 1999. Positive PDV phases were observed from the 1920s to the mid-
1940s and from the late 1970s to the late 1990s, while negative phases occurred from mid-1940s until the 
late 1970s, and since 1999 (Figure 2.38; Han et al., 2013; Chen and Wallace, 2015; Newman M. et al., 
2016). The associated spatial patterns are quite similar, but the PDO pattern exhibits stronger SST anomalies 
in the extra-tropical North Pacific than the IPO (Chen & Wallace, 2015). The strength and structure of the 
SST patterns also differ among the periods (Newman M. et al., 2016). 
 
<figref>2.38</figref> 
 
Instrumental observations are sparse prior to 1950, and thus the fidelity of any PDV index derived for the 
second part of the 19th century and early decades of the 1900s is relatively low (Deng et al., 2013; Wen et 
al., 2014) (Figure 2.38). This results in low agreement in the classification of the PDO / IPO phase among 
several indices, even during recent years with the availability of high-quality data. Nevertheless, the 
teleconnection patterns are robust regardless of the index used to characterize the PDO (McAfee, 2017). 
Analysis of time series of PDO and IPO highlights the (multi-) decadal nature of this mode of variability 
with no significant trends, but highlights a recent switch from a positive to a negative phase since 1999 / 
2000 across all indicators (England et al., 2014; Henley, 2017).  
 
In summary, the PDV in the instrumental record is dominated by (multi-) decadal-scale shifts between 
positive and negative phases over the last 150 years with no overall trend (high confidence). There is low 
confidence in paleo-PDV reconstructions due to discrepancies among the various available time series in 
terms of phasing and timing. However, there is high confidence in the occurrence of a shift from 
predominantly negative to positive PDO conditions from the middle to the late Holocene.  
 
 
## 2.4.6  Atlantic Multidecadal Variability 
 
AR5 reported no robust changes in Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV) reconstructions based on paleo 
records due to low consistency between different AMV reconstructions prior to 1900. AR5 concluded that 
there have been no significant trends in the AMV index during the instrumental period and there was 
difficulty in interpreting the AMV signal because of the long-term underlying SST warming trend.  
 
The AR5 conclusions about large uncertainties in AMV paleo reconstructions (Hernández et al., 2020) have 
been reinforced by recent studies of tree rings (Wang et al., 2017b), Greenland ice (Chylek et al., 2012), and 
corals (Kilbourne et al., 2014; Svendsen et al., 2014a; Wang et al., 2017b). The AMV exhibited a generally 
positive state over the first millennium of the CE (Mann et al., 2009; Singh et al., 2018). Paleo 
reconstructions over the last millennium consistently show a negative AMV phase during 1400–1850 CE and 
a positive phase during 900–1200 CE (Mann et al., 2009; Singh et al., 2018; Wang J. et al., 2017), consistent 
with warmer surface temperatures from tropical Atlantic records (Kilbourne et al., 2014).  
 
Instrumental observations show that AMV is characterized by basin-wide warm and cool periods with an 
average variation in SST of about 0.4°C, but with larger variations in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre. 
Despite small differences in indices used to define the AMV (Annex IV), they all show warm periods 
occurring approximately between 1880–1900, 1940–1960, and from the mid-1990s to present, with cool 
periods in between (Figure 2.38) but no overall sustained change during the instrumental period (Bellomo et 
al., 2018; Booth et al., 2012; Gulev et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2017). 
 
The oceanic changes are seen in salinity and temperature variations over the upper 3000 m of the North 
Atlantic (Polyakov et al., 2005; Keenlyside et al., 2015), and in sea level variations in the Western North 
Atlantic along the Gulf Stream passage (McCarthy et al., 2015). The pattern and strength of the AMV differs 
among the periods (e.g., Svendsen et al., 2014a; Reynolds et al., 2018) and there are indications that there 
may have been a shift since 2005 toward a negative phase of the AMV (Robson et al., 2016). 
 
In summary, no sustained change in AMV indices has been observed over the instrumental period (high 
confidence). However, instrumental records may not be long enough to distinguish any oscillatory behaviour 
from trends in the AMV. There is low confidence in the paleo AMV reconstructions due to a paucity of high-
resolution records.  
 
 
# 2.5  Final remarks  
 
The assessment in this chapter is based upon an ever-expanding volume of available proxy and observational 
records and a growing body of literature. Since AR5, improvements have been made in all aspects of data 
collection, data curation, data provision and data analysis permitting improved scientific insights. The 
chapter has also benefitted from the availability of new products from a range of emerging, mainly space-
based, observing capabilities and new generations of reanalysis products. However, a number of key 
challenges still remain which, if addressed, would serve to strengthen future reports. 
 
- Development of new techniques and exploitation of existing and new proxy sources may help 
address challenges around the low temporal resolution of most paleoclimate proxy records, 
particularly prior to the Common Era, and ambiguities around converting paleoclimate proxy data 
into estimates of climate-relevant variables. Conversions rely upon important proxy-specific 
assumptions and biases can be large due to limited accounting of seasonality, non-climatic effects, or 
the influence of multiple climate variables. These challenges currently limit the ability to ascertain 
the historical unusualness of recent directly observed climate changes for many indicators. {2.2, 2.3} 
- Improved sharing of historical instrumental and proxy records (including metadata) along with 
significant efforts at data rescue of presently undigitised records would serve to significantly 
strengthen many aspects of the present assessment. Longer observational time series help to better 
understand variability, and any underlying periodicity in climate indicators and climate forcers, 
especially for components of the climate system where the dominant response is on multi-decadal 
and longer time scales. Targeted rescue of early marine data records, especially from waters of the 
tropical oceans and the Southern Ocean could help constrain modes of variability and important 
teleconnection changes in, for example, the hydrological cycle and patterns of global temperature 
change. {2.2, 2.3, 2.4} 
- Contemporary observing systems have limitations in parts of the Earth system with limited 
accessibility or coverage, for example coastal and shallow ocean, polar regions, marine biosphere, 
and the deep sea, leading to seasonal-dependency and regional variability in data coverage and 
uncertainty which serve to limit confidence in the present assessment of changes. {2.3}  
- Contradictory lines of evidence exist between observations and models on the relationship between 
the rates of warming in GMST and GSAT, compounded by limitations in theoretical understanding. 
Improvements in air temperature datasets over the ocean and an improved understanding of the 
representation of the lowermost atmosphere over the ocean in models would reduce uncertainty in 
assessed changes in GSAT. {Cross-Chapter Box 2.3}
