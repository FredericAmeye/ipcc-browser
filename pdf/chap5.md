# 5.es Executive Summary  
 
It is unequivocal that emissions of the well-mixed greenhouse gases (GHG) carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane 
(CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) from human activities are the main driver of increases in atmospheric GHG 
concentrations since the pre-industrial period. The accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere is determined 
by the balance between anthropogenic emissions, anthropogenic removals, and physical-biogeochemical 
source and sink dynamics on land and in the ocean. This chapter assesses how physical and biogeochemical 
processes of the carbon and nitrogen cycles affect the variability and trends of GHGs in the atmosphere as 
well as ocean acidification and deoxygenation. It identifies physical and biogeochemical feedbacks that have 
affected or could affect future rates of GHG accumulation in the atmosphere, and therefore, influence 
climate change and its impacts. This chapter also assesses the remaining carbon budget to limit global 
warming within various goals, as well as the large-scale consequences of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and 
solar radiation modification (SRM) on biogeochemical cycles {Figures 5.1, 5.2}. 
 
## The Human Perturbation of the Carbon and Biogeochemical cycles 
 
*Global mean concentrations for well-mixed GHGs (CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O) in 2019 correspond to 
increases of about 47%, 156%, and 23%, respectively, above the levels in 1750 (representative of the 
pre-industrial) (high confidence).* Current atmospheric concentrations of the three GHGs are higher than at 
any point in the last 800,000 years, and in 2019 reached 409.9 ppm of CO₂, 1866.3 ppb of CH₄, and 332.1 
ppb of N₂O (very high confidence). Current CO₂ concentrations in the atmosphere are also unprecedented in 
the last 2 million years (high confidence). In the past 60 Myr, there have been periods in Earth’s history 
when CO₂ concentrations were significantly higher than at present, but multiple lines of evidence show that 
the rate at which CO₂ has increased in the atmosphere during 1900–2019 is at least 10 times faster than at 
any other time during the last 800,000 years (high confidence), and 4-5 times faster than during the last 56 
million years (low confidence). {5.1.1, 2.2.3; Figures 5.3, 5.4; Cross-Chapter Box 2.1} 
  
## Contemporary Trends of Greenhouse Gases  
 
*It is unequivocal that the increase of CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O in the atmosphere over the industrial era is 
the result of human activities (very high confidence).* This assessment is based on multiple lines of 
evidence including atmospheric gradients, isotopes, and inventory data. During the last measured decade, 
global average annual anthropogenic emissions of CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O, reached the highest levels in human 
history at 10.9 ± 0.9 PgC yr<sup>–1</sup> (2010–2019), 335–383 Tg CH₄ yr<sup>–1</sup> (2008–2017), and 4.2–11.4 TgN yr<sup>–1</sup> 
(2007–2016), respectively (high confidence). {5.2.1, 5.2.2, 5.2.3, 5.2.4; Figures 5.6, 5.13, 5.15}. 
 
*The CO₂ emitted from human activities during the decade of 2010–2019 (decadal average 10.9 ± 0.9 
PgC yr<sup>–1</sup>) was distributed between three Earth system components: 46% accumulated in the 
atmosphere (5.1 ± 0.02 PgC yr<sup>–1</sup>), 23% was taken up by the ocean (2.5 ± 0.6 PgC yr<sup>–1</sup>) and 31% was 
stored by vegetation in terrestrial ecosystems (3.4 ± 0.9 PgC yr<sup>–1</sup>) (high confidence).* Of the total 
anthropogenic CO₂ emissions, the combustion of fossil fuels was responsible for 81–91%, with the 
remainder being the net CO₂ flux from land-use change and land management (e.g., deforestation, 
degradation, regrowth after agricultural abandonment or peat drainage). {5.2.1.2, 5.2.1.5; Table 5.1; Figures 
5.5, 5.7, 5.12} 
  
*Over the past six decades, the average fraction of anthropogenic CO₂ emissions that has accumulated 
in the atmosphere (referred to as the airborne fraction) has remained nearly constant at 
approximately 44%.* The ocean and land sinks of CO₂ have continued to grow over the past six decades in 
response to increasing anthropogenic CO₂ emissions (high confidence). Interannual and decadal variability of 
the regional and global ocean and land sinks indicate that these sinks are sensitive to climate conditions and 
therefore to climate change (high confidence). {5.2.1.1, 5.2.1.3, 5.2.1.4.2; Figures 5.7, 5.8, 5.10} 
  
*Recent observations show that ocean carbon processes are starting to change in response to the 
growing ocean sink, and these changes are expected to contribute significantly to future weakening of 
the ocean sink under medium- to high-emission scenarios.* However, the effects of these changes is not 
yet reflected in a weakening trend of the contemporary (1960–2019) ocean sink (high confidence). {5.1.2, 
5.2.1.3, 5.3.2.1; Figures 5.8, 5.20; Cross-Chapter Box 5.3}  
 
*Atmospheric concentration of CH₄ grew at an average rate of 7.6 ± 2.7 ppb yr<sup>–1</sup> for the last decade 
(2010–2019), with a faster growth of 9.3 ± 2.4 ppb yr<sup>–1</sup> over the last six years (2014–2019) (high 
confidence)*. The multi-decadal growth trend in atmospheric CH₄ is dominated by anthropogenic activities 
(high confidence), and the growth since 2007 is largely driven by emissions from both fossil fuels and 
agriculture (dominated by livestock) sectors (medium confidence). The interannual variability is dominated 
by El Niño–Southern Oscillation cycles, during which biomass burning and wetland emissions, as well as 
loss by reaction with tropospheric hydroxyl radical OH play an important role. {5.2.2; Figures 5.13, 5.14; 
Table 5.2; Cross-Chapter Box 5.2} 
  
*Atmospheric concentration of N₂O grew at an average rate of 0.85 ± 0.03 ppb yr<sup>–1</sup> between 1995 and 
2019, with a further increase to 0.95 ± 0.04 ppb yr<sup>–1</sup> in the most recent decade (2010–2019).* This 
increase is dominated by anthropogenic emissions, which have increased by 30% between the 1980s and the 
most recent observational decade (2007–2016) (high confidence). Increased use of nitrogen fertilizer and 
manure contributed to about two-thirds of the increase during the 1980–2016 period, with the fossil 
fuels/industry, biomass burning, and wastewater accounting for much of the rest (high confidence). {5.2.3; 
Figures 5.15, 5.16, 5.17} 
  
## Ocean Acidification and Ocean Deoxygenation 
  
*Ocean acidification is strengthening as a result of the ocean continuing to take up CO₂ from human-
caused emissions (very high confidence).* This CO₂ uptake is driving changes in seawater chemistry that 
result in the decrease of pH and associated reductions in the saturation state of calcium carbonate, which is a 
constituent of skeletons or shells of a variety of marine organisms. These trends of ocean acidification are 
becoming clearer globally, with a very likely rate of decrease in pH in the ocean surface layer of 0.016 to 
0.020 per decade in the subtropics and 0.002 to 0.026 per decade in subpolar and polar zones since the 
1980s. Ocean acidification has spread deeper in the ocean, surpassing 2000 m depth in the northern North 
Atlantic and in the Southern Ocean. The greater projected pH declines in CMIP6 models are primarily a 
consequence of higher atmospheric CO₂ concentrations in the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) 
scenarios than their CMIP5-RCP analogues {5.3.2.2, 5.3.3.1; 5.3.4.1; Figures 5.20, 5.21}  
  
*Ocean deoxygenation is projected to continue to increase with ocean warming (high confidence).* Earth 
system models (ESMs) project a 32–71% greater subsurface (100–600 m) oxygen decline, depending on 
scenario, than reported in the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere (SROCC) for the period 2080–2099.
This is attributed to the effect of larger surface warming in CMIP6 models, which increases ocean 
stratification and reduces ventilation (medium confidence). There is low confidence in the projected reduction 
of oceanic N₂O emissions under high emission scenarios because of greater oxygen losses simulated in 
ESMs in CMIP6, uncertainties in the process of oceanic N₂O emissions, and a limited number of modelling 
studies available {5.3.3.2; 7.5}. 
  
## Future Projections of Carbon Feedbacks on Climate Change 
  
*Oceanic and terrestrial carbon sinks are projected to continue to grow with increasing atmospheric 
concentrations of CO₂, but the fraction of emissions taken up by land and ocean is expected to decline 
as the CO₂ concentration increases (high confidence).* ESMs suggest approximately equal global land and 
ocean carbon uptake for each of the SSPs scenarios. However, the range of model projections is much larger 
for the land carbon sink. Despite the wide range of model responses, uncertainty in atmospheric CO₂ by 
2100 is dominated by future anthropogenic emissions rather than uncertainties related to carbon–climate 
feedbacks (high confidence). {5.4.5; Figure 5.25, 5.26} 
 
*Increases in atmospheric CO₂ lead to increases in land carbon storage through CO₂ fertilization of 
photosynthesis and increased water use efficiency (high confidence).* However, the overall change in land 
carbon also depends on land-use change and on the response of vegetation and soil to continued warming 
and changes in the water cycle, including increased droughts in some regions that will diminish the sink 
capacity. Climate change alone is expected to increase land carbon accumulation in the high latitudes (not 
including permafrost), but also to lead to a counteracting loss of land carbon in the tropics (medium 
confidence, Figure 5.25). More than half of the latest CMIP6 ESMs include nutrient limitations on the 
carbon cycle, but these models still project increasing tropical land carbon (medium confidence) and 
increasing global land carbon (high confidence) through the 21st century. {5.4.1, 5.4.3, 5.4.5; Figure 5.27; 
Cross-Chapter Box 5.1} 
  
*Future trajectories of the ocean CO₂ sink are strongly emissions-scenario dependent (high confidence).* 
Emission scenarios SSP4-6.0 and SSP5-8.5 lead to warming of the surface ocean and large reductions of the 
buffering capacity, which will slow the growth of the ocean sink after 2050. Scenario SSP1-2.6 limits further 
reductions in buffering capacity and warming, and the ocean sink weakens in response to the declining rate 
of increasing atmospheric CO₂. There is low confidence in how changes in the biological pump will 
influence the magnitude and direction of the ocean carbon feedback. {5.4.2, 5.4.4, Cross-Chapter Box 5.3} 
 
*Beyond 2100, land and ocean may transition from being a carbon sink to a source under either very 
high emissions or net negative emissions scenarios, but for different reasons.* Under very high emissions 
scenarios such as SSP5-8.5, ecosystem carbon losses due to warming lead the land to transition from a 
carbon sink to a source (medium confidence), while the ocean is expected to remain a sink (high confidence). 
For scenarios in which CO₂ concentration stabilizes, land and ocean carbon sinks gradually take up less 
carbon as the increase in atmospheric CO₂ slows down. In scenarios with moderate net negative CO₂ 
emissions and CO₂ concentrations declining during the 21st century (e.g., SSP1-2.6), the land sink 
transitions to a net source in decades to a few centuries after CO₂ emissions become net negative, while the 
ocean remains a sink (low confidence). Under scenarios with large net negative CO₂ emissions and rapidly 
declining CO₂ concentrations (e.g., SSP5-3.4-OS (overshoot)), both land and ocean switch from a sink to a 
transient source during the overshoot period (medium confidence). {5.4.10, 5.6.2.1.2; Figures 5.30, 5.33} 
 
*Thawing terrestrial permafrost will lead to carbon release (high confidence), but there is low 
confidence in the timing, magnitude and the relative roles of CO₂ versus CH₄ as feedback processes.* 
CO₂ release from permafrost is projected to be 3–41 PgC per 1ºC of global warming by 2100, based on an 
ensemble of models. However, the incomplete representation of important processes such as abrupt thaw, 
combined with weak observational constraints, only allow low confidence in both the magnitude of these 
estimates and in how linearly proportional this feedback is to the amount of global warming. It is very 
unlikely that gas clathrates in terrestrial and subsea permafrost will lead to a detectable departure from the 
emissions trajectory during this century. {5.4.9; Box 5.1} 
 
*The net response of natural CH₄ and N₂O sources to future warming will be increased emissions 
(medium confidence).* Key processes include increased CH₄ emissions from wetlands and permafrost thaw, 
as well as increased soil N₂O emissions in a warmer climate, while ocean N₂O emissions are projected to 
decline at centennial time scale. The magnitude of the responses of each individual process and how linearly 
proportional these feedbacks are to the amount of global warming is known with low confidence due to 
incomplete representation of important processes in models combined with weak observational constraints. 
Models project that over the 21st century the combined feedback of 0.02–0.09 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> °C<sup>–1</sup> is comparable to 
the effect of a CO₂ release of 5-18 PgCeq °C<sup>–1</sup> (low confidence). {5.4.7, 5.4.8; Figure 5.29} 
 
*The response of biogeochemical cycles to the anthropogenic perturbation can be abrupt at regional 
scales, and irreversible on decadal to century time scales (high confidence).* The probability of crossing 
uncertain regional thresholds (e.g., high severity fires, forest dieback) increases with climate change (high 
confidence). Possible abrupt changes and tipping points in biogeochemical cycles lead to additional 
uncertainty in 21st century GHG concentrations, but these are very likely to be smaller than the uncertainty 
associated with future anthropogenic emissions (high confidence). {5.4.9} 
   
## Remaining Carbon Budgets to Climate Stabilization 
 
*There is a near-linear relationship between cumulative CO₂ emissions and the increase in global mean 
surface air temperature (GSAT) caused by CO₂ over the course of this century for global warming 
levels up to at least 2°C relative to pre-industrial (high confidence).* Halting global warming would thus 
require global net anthropogenic CO₂ emissions to become zero. The ratio between cumulative CO₂ 
emissions and the consequent GSAT increase, which is called the transient climate response to cumulative 
emissions of CO₂ (TCRE), likely falls in the 1.0°C–2.3°C per 1000 PgC range. The narrowing of this range 
compared to AR5 is due to a better integration of evidence across the science in this assessment. Beyond this 
century, there is low confidence that the TCRE remains an accurate predictor of temperature changes in 
scenarios of very low or net negative CO₂ emissions because of uncertain Earth system feedbacks that can 
result in further warming or a path-dependency of warming as a function of cumulative CO₂ emissions. {5.4, 
5.5.1} 
  
*Mitigation requirements over this century for limiting maximum warming to specific levels can be 
quantified using a carbon budget that relates cumulative CO₂ emissions to global mean temperature 
increase (high confidence).* For the period 1850–2019, a total of 655 ± 65 PgC (2390 ± 240 GtCO₂) of 
anthropogenic CO₂ has been emitted. Remaining carbon budgets (starting from 1 January 2020) for limiting 
warming to 1.5°C, 1.7°C, and 2.0°C are 140 PgC (500 GtCO₂), 230 PgC (850 GtCO₂) and 370 PgC (1350 
GtCO₂), respectively, based on the 50th percentile of TCRE. For the 67th percentile, the respective values 
are 110 PgC (400 GtCO₂), 190 PgC (700 GtCO₂) and 310 PgC (1150 GtCO₂). These remaining carbon 
budgets may vary by an estimated ± 60 PgC (220 GtCO₂) depending on how successfully future non-CO₂ 
emissions can be reduced. Since AR5 and SR1.5, estimates have undergone methodological improvements, 
resulting in larger, yet consistent estimates. {5.5.2, 5.6; Figure 5.31; Table 5.8} 
  
*Several factors affect the precise value of remaining carbon budgets, including estimates of historical 
warming, future emissions from thawing permafrost, and variations in projected non-CO₂ warming.* 
Remaining carbon budget estimates can increase or decrease by 150 PgC (550 GtCO₂, likely range) due to 
uncertainties in the level of historical warming, and by an additional ± 60 PgC (±220 GtCO, likely range) due 
to geophysical uncertainties surrounding the climate response to non-CO₂ emissions such as CH₄, N₂O, and 
aerosols. Permafrost thaw is included in the estimates together with other feedbacks that are often not 
captured by models. Despite the large uncertainties surrounding the quantification of the effects of additional 
Earth system feedback processes, such as emissions from wetlands and permafrost thaw, these feedbacks 
represent identified additional amplifying risk factors that scale with additional warming and mostly increase 
the challenge of limiting warming to specific temperature thresholds. These uncertainties do not change the 
basic conclusion that global CO₂ emissions would need to decline to at least net zero to halt global warming. 
{5.4, 5.5.2}  
 
## Biogeochemical Implications of Carbon Dioxide Removal and Solar Radiation Modification 
 
*Land- and ocean-based carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods have the potential to sequester CO₂ 
from the atmosphere, but the benefits of this removal would be partially offset by CO₂ release from 
land and ocean carbon stores (very high confidence).* The fraction of CO₂ removed that remains out of the 
atmosphere, a measure of CDR effectiveness, decreases slightly with increasing amount of removal (medium 
confidence) and decreases strongly if CDR is applied at lower CO₂ concentrations (medium confidence). 
{5.6.2.1; Figures 5.32, 5.33, 5.34} 
 
*The century-scale climate–carbon cycle response to a CO₂ removal from the atmosphere is not always 
equal and opposite to the response to a CO₂ emission (medium confidence).* For simultaneously 
cumulative CO₂ emissions and removals of greater than or equal to 100 PgC, CO₂ emissions are 4 ± 3% 
more effective at raising atmospheric CO₂ than CO₂ removals are at lowering atmospheric CO₂. The 
asymmetry originates from state-dependencies and non-linearities in carbon cycle processes and implies that 
an extra amount of CDR is required to compensate for a positive emission of a given magnitude to attain the 
same change in atmospheric CO₂. The net effect of this asymmetry on the global surface temperature is 
poorly constrained due to low agreement between models (low confidence). {5.6.2.1; Figure 5.35} 
 
*Wide-ranging side-effects of CDR methods have been identified that can either weaken or strengthen 
the carbon sequestration and cooling potential of these methods and affect the achievement of 
sustainable development goals (high confidence).* Biophysical and biogeochemical side-effects of CDR 
methods are associated with changes in surface albedo, the water cycle, emissions of CH₄ and N₂O, ocean 
acidification and marine ecosystem productivity (high confidence). These side-effects and associated Earth 
system feedbacks can decrease carbon uptake and/or change local and regional climate, and in turn limit the 
CO₂ sequestration and cooling potential of specific CDR methods (medium confidence). Deployment of 
CDR, particularly on land, can also affect water quality and quantity, food production and biodiversity, with 
consequences for the achievement of related sustainable development goals (high confidence). These effects 
are often highly dependent on local context, management regime, prior land use, and scale of deployment 
(high confidence). A wide range of co-benefits are obtained with methods that seek to restore natural 
ecosystems or improve soil carbon (high confidence). The biogeochemical effects of terminating CDR are 
expected to be small for most CDR methods (medium confidence). {5.6.2.2; Figure 5.36; Cross-Chapter Box 
5.1} 
  
*Solar radiation modification (SRM) would increase the global land and ocean CO₂ sinks (medium 
confidence) but would not stop CO₂ from increasing in the atmosphere, thus exacerbating ocean 
acidification under continued anthropogenic emissions (high confidence).* SRM acts to cool the planet 
relative to unmitigated climate change, which would increase the land sink by reducing plant and soil 
respiration and slow the reduction of ocean carbon uptake due to warming (medium confidence). SRM would 
not counteract or stop ocean acidification (high confidence). The sudden and sustained termination of SRM 
would rapidly increase global warming, with the return of positive and negative effects on the carbon sinks 
(very high confidence) {4.6.3; 5.6.3} 


# 5.1 Introduction  
 
The physical and biogeochemical controls of greenhouse gases (GHGs) is a central motivation for this 
chapter, which identifies biogeochemical feedbacks that have led or could lead to a future acceleration, 
slowdown or abrupt transitions in the rate of GHG accumulation in the atmosphere, and therefore of climate 
change. A characterisation of the trends and feedbacks lead to improved quantification for the remaining 
carbon budgets for climate stabilisation, and the responses of the carbon cycle to atmospheric CO₂ removal, 
which is embedded in many of the mitigation scenarios, to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.  
 
Changes in the abundance of well-mixed GHGs (carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide 
(N₂O)) in the atmosphere play a large role in determining the Earth’s radiative properties and its climate in 
the past, the present and the future (Chapters 2, 4, 6 and 7). Since 1950, the increase in atmospheric GHGs 
has been the dominant cause of the human-induced climate change (Section 3.3). While the main driver of 
changes in atmospheric GHGs over the past 200 years relate to the direct emissions from human activities, 
the net accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere is controlled by biogeochemical source-sink dynamics of 
carbon that exchange between multiple reservoirs on land, oceans and atmosphere. The combustion of fossil 
fuels and land use change for the period 1750–2019 have released an estimated 700 ± 75 PgC (1 PgC = 1015 
g of carbon) to the atmosphere of which less than half remains in the atmosphere today (Sections 5.2.1.2; 
5.2.1.5) (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). This underscores the central role of terrestrial and ocean CO₂ sinks in 
regulating its atmospheric concentration (Ballantyne et al., 2012; Li et al., 2016c; Le Quéré et al., 2018a; 
Ciais et al., 2019; Gruber et al., 2019a; Friedlingstein et al., 2020). 
 
The chapter covers three dominant GHGs in the human perturbation of the Earth’s radiation budget for 
which high quality records exist: carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) (Figure 5.1). 
 
Section 5.1 (this section) provides the time context on how unique current and future scenarios of GHGs 
atmospheric concentrations and growth rates are in the Earth’s history. It also introduces the main processes 
involved in carbon-climate feedbacks followed by an assessment of what can be learned from the paleo 
record towards a better understanding of contemporary and future GHGs-climate dynamics and their 
response to different mitigation trajectories. 
 
Section 5.2 covers the state of the carbon cycle and other biogeochemical cycles, and global budgets of CO₂, 
CH₄ and N₂O for the industrial era (since 1750). The section emphasises the last 60-year period for which 
high-resolution observations are available and the most recent decade for comprehensive GHGs budgets. 
Significant advances have taken place since the IPCC fifth assessment report (AR5), particularly in 
constraining the annual to decadal variability of the ocean and land carbon sources and sinks, and in 
revealing about the sensitivity of carbon pools to current and future climate changes. There has been an 
important increase in modelling capability of the three GHGs both for land and oceans, atmospheric and 
ocean observations, and remote sensing products that has enabled to constrain the causes of the observed 
trends and variability. 
 
Section 5.3 builds on SROCC covering the change in ocean acidification due to oceanic CO₂ uptake across 
the paleo, historical periods and future projections using CMIP6, with consequences for marine life (assessed 
in sixth assessment report (AR6) working group II (WGII)) and biogeochemical cycles. The section also 
assesses changes in deoxygenation of the oceans due to warming, increased stratification of the surface 
ocean and slowing of the meridional overturning circulation.  
 
Section 5.4 covers the future projections of biogeochemical cycles and their feedbacks to the climate system 
fully utilising the database of the concentration-driven coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 
(CMIP6). Since AR5, Earth system models (ESMs) have made progress towards including more complex 
carbon cycle and associated biogeochemical processes that enable exploring a range of possible future 
carbon-climate feedbacks and their influences on the climate system. The section addresses uncertainties and 
limits of our models to predict future dynamics for GHG emissions trajectories, as well as new 
understanding on processes involved in carbon-climate feedbacks and the possibility for rapid and abrupt 
changes brought by non-linear dynamics.  
 
Section 5.5 covers the development of the total and remaining carbon budgets to climate stabilisation targets 
and the associated transient climate response to cumulative CO₂ emissions. The section shows the progress 
made since the AR5  (IPCC, 2013a) and the 1.5°C Special Report (IPCC, 2018a), particularly on key 
components required to estimate the remaining carbon budget, including the transient response to cumulative 
emissions of CO₂, the zero emission commitment, the projected non-CO₂ warming, and the unrepresented 
Earth system feedbacks. 
 
Section 5.6 assesses the impacts of carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation modification for the purpose 
of climate mitigation on the global carbon cycle building from the assessment in the IPCC Special Report on 
Climate Change and Land (SRCCL). It includes an overview of the major carbon dioxide removal options 
and potential collateral biogeochemical effects beyond those intended climate mitigation strategies. The 
potential capacity to deliver atmospheric reductions and the socio-economic feasibility of such options are 
assessed in detail in AR6 working group III (WGIII). 
 
Finally, Section 5.7 highlights the knowledge gaps as limits to the assessment, which would have 
strengthened this assessment had those gaps not existed.

## 5.1.1  The Physical and Biogeochemical Processes in Carbon-Climate feedbacks 
 
The influence of anthropogenic CO₂ emissions and emission scenarios on the carbon – climate system is 
primarily driving the ocean and terrestrial sinks as major negative feedbacks (β) that determine the 
atmospheric CO₂ levels, that then drive climate feedbacks through radiative forcing (γ) (Figure 5.2) 
(Friedlingstein et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2013b; Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020). Biogeochemical feedbacks 
follow as an outcome of both carbon and climate forcing on the physics and the biogeochemical processes of 
the ocean and terrestrial carbon cycles (Figure 5.2) (Katavouta et al., 2018; Williams et al., 2019; Jones and 
Friedlingstein, 2020). Together, these carbon-climate feedbacks can amplify or suppress climate change by 
altering the rate at which CO₂ builds up in the atmosphere through changes in the land and ocean sources and 
sinks (Figure 5.2) (Jones et al., 2013b; Raupach et al., 2014; Williams et al., 2019). These changes depend on 
the, often non-linear, interaction of the drivers (CO₂ and climate) and processes in the ocean and land as well 
as the emission scenarios (Figure 5.2; Sections 5.4 and 5.6) (Raupach et al., 2014; Schwinger et al., 2014; 
Williams et al., 2019). There is high confidence that carbon-climate feedbacks and their century scale 
evolution play a critical role in two linked climate metrics that have significant climate and policy 
implications: (i) the fraction of anthropogenic CO₂ emissions that remains in the atmosphere, the so-called 
airborne fraction of CO₂ (AF) (Figure 5.2, Section 5.2.1.2, Figure 5.7, FAQ 5.1), and (ii) the quasi-linear 
trend characteristic of the transient temperature response to cumulative CO₂ emissions (TCRE) 
(MacDougall, 2016; Williams et al., 2016; Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020; Section 5.5) and other GHGs 
(CH₄ and N₂O). This chapter assesses the implications of these issues from a carbon cycle processes 
perspective (Figure 5.2) in Sections 5.2 (historical and contemporary), 5.3 (changing carbonate chemistry), 
5.4 (future projections), 5.5 (remaining carbon budget) and 5.6 (response to carbon dioxide removal and 
solar radiation modification). 
 
The airborne fraction is an important constraint for adjustments in carbon-climate feedbacks and reflects the 
partitioning of CO₂ emissions between reservoirs by the negative feedbacks, which for the decade 2010–
2019 were 31% on land and 23% in the ocean and also dominated the historical period (Figure 5.2; Table 
5.1) (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). During the period 1959–2019, the airborne fraction has largely followed the 
growth in anthropogenic CO₂ emissions with a mean of 44% and a large interannual variability (Ballantyne 
et al., 2012; Ciais et al., 2019; Friedlingstein et al., 2020) (Section 5.2.1.2; Table 5.1). The negative feedback 
to CO₂ concentrations is associated with its impact on the air-sea and air-land CO₂ exchange through 
strengthening of partial pressure of CO₂ (pCO₂) gradients as well as the internal processes that enhance 
uptake. Two of these key processes are the buffering capacity of the ocean and the CO₂ fertilisation effect on 
gross primary production (Section 5.4.1–5.4.4).  
 
Positive and negative climate and carbon feedbacks involve, (i) fast processes on land and oceans at time 
scales from minutes to years such as photosynthesis, soil respiration, net primary production, shallow ocean 
physics and air-sea fluxes, and (ii) slower processes taking decades to millennia such as changing ocean 
buffering capacity, ocean ventilation, vegetation dynamics, permafrost changes, peat formation and 
decomposition (Figure 5.2) (Ciais et al., 2013; Forzieri et al., 2017; Williams et al., 2019). Depending on the 
particular combination of driver process and response dynamics, they behave as positive or negative 
feedbacks that amplify or dampen the magnitude and rates of climate change, respectively (Cox et al., 2000; 
Friedlingstein et al., 2003, 2006; Hauck and Völker, 2015; Williams et al., 2019); red and turquoise arrows 
in Figure 5.2; Section 5.2.1.5; Table 5.1).   
 
Carbon cycle feedbacks co-exist with climate (heat and moisture) feedbacks (Cross-Chapter Boxes 5.1 and  
5.3), which together drive contemporary (Section 5.2) and future (Section 5.4) carbon-climate feedbacks 
(Williams et al., 2019). The excess heat generated by radiative forcing from increasing concentration of 
atmospheric CO₂ and other GHGs is mostly taken up by the ocean (> 90%) and the residual balance 
partitioned between atmospheric, terrestrial and ice melting (Cross-Chapter Box 9.2; Frölicher et al., 2015). 
The combined effect of these two large scale negative feedbacks of CO₂ and heat are reflected in the TCRE 
(Section 5.5; Cross-Chapter Box 5.3), which points to a quasi-linear and quasi-emission-path independent 
relationship between cumulative emissions of CO₂ and global warming, which is used as the basis to 
estimate the remaining carbon budget (Section 5.5) (MacDougall and Friedlingstein, 2015; MacDougall, 
2017; Bronselaer and Zanna, 2020; Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020). There is still low confidence on the 
relative roles and importance of the ocean and terrestrial carbon processes on TCRE variability and 
uncertainty on centennial time scales (MacDougall, 2016; MacDougall et al., 2017; Williams et al., 2017a; 
Katavouta et al., 2018, 2019; Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020) (Sections 5.5.1.1, 5.5.1.2).  
 
<figref>5.2</figref> 
 
The combined effects of climate and CO₂ concentration feedbacks on the global carbon cycle are projected 
by ESMs to modify both the processes and natural reservoirs of carbon on a regional and global scale that 
may result in positive feedbacks (red arrows in Figure 5.2), which could weaken the major terrestrial and 
ocean sinks and disrupt both the airborne fraction and TCRE under medium to high emission scenarios 
(Figure 5.25; Section 5.4.5). 
 
## 5.1.2  Paleo Trends and Feedbacks 
 
Paleoclimatic proxy records extend beyond the variability of recent decadal climate oscillations and thus 
provide an independent perspective on feedbacks between climate and carbon cycle dynamics. These past 
changes according to reconstructions were slower than the current anthropogenic ones, so they cannot 
provide an unequivocal comparison. Nonetheless, they can help appraise sensitivities and point toward 
potentially dominant mechanisms of change (Tierney et al., 2020) on (sub)centennial to (multi)millennial 
timescales. 
 
AR5 (WGI, Chapter 5) concluded with medium confidence that atmospheric CO₂ concentrations reached 
350–450 ppm during the mid-Pliocene (3.3–3.0 Ma), and possibly 1000 ppm during the Early Eocene (52–48 
Ma). AR5 (WGI, Chapter 5) also concluded with very high confidence that the current rates of CO₂, CH₄ and 
N₂O rise in atmospheric concentrations were unprecedented with respect to the ice core record covering the 
last deglacial transition (LDT, 18–11 ka) and with medium confidence that the rate of change of the 
reconstructed GHG rise was also unprecedented compared to the lower resolution of the records of the past 
800 kyr. 
 
### 5.1.2.1  Cenozoic Proxy CO₂ Record 
 
Quantifying past changes in the rate of CO₂ accumulation in the atmosphere based on reconstructions using 
marine sediment proxies is complex as age model uncertainties, assumptions and shortcomings underlying 
proxy applications and sedimentary processes conspire to alter and confound rate estimates (Ajayi et al., 
2020). Indeed, differential sediment mixing and bioturbation contribute to smooth and attenuate proxy 
records (Hupp and Kelly, 2020), thereby tending to underestimate maximum rates of change (Kemp et al., 
2015). Considering the extent to which uncertainties can affect sediment-based rate estimates and 
notwithstanding recent effort in minimizing their inherent contribution, there is generally low to medium 
confidence in quantifying rates of change on timescale less than a decade back thousands of years, and less 
than a millennium back millions of years in the past based on marine sediments. 
 
In the past, atmospheric CO₂ concentrations reached much higher levels than present day (see Cross-Chapter 
Box 2.1; Figure 5.3). In particular, the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM), 55.9–55.7 Ma (Figure 
5.3), provides some level of comparison with the current and projected anthropogenic increase in CO₂ 
emissions (Chapter 2). Atmospheric CO₂ concentrations increased from about 900 to around 2000 ppm in 3–
20 kyr as a result of geological carbon release to the ocean-atmosphere system (Zeebe et al., 2016; Gutjahr et 
al., 2017; Cui and Schubert, 2018; Kirtland Turner, 2018). There is low to medium confidence in evaluations 
of the total amount of carbon released during the PETM, as proxy data constrained estimates vary from 
around 3000 to more than 7000 PgC, with methane hydrates, volcanic emissions, terrestrial and/or marine 
organic carbon, or some combination thereof, as the probable sources of carbon (Zeebe et al., 2009; Cui et 
al., 2011; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Luo et al., 2016; Jones et al., 2019; Elling et al., 2020; Haynes & Hönisch, 
2020). Methane emissions related to hydrate/permafrost thawing and fossil carbon oxidation may have acted 
as positive feedbacks (Lunt et al., 2011; Armstrong McKay and Lenton, 2018; Lyons et al., 2019), as the 
inferred increase in atmospheric CO₂ can only account for approximately half of the reported warming 
(Zeebe et al., 2009). The estimated, time-integrated carbon input is broadly similar to the RCP8.5 extension 
scenario, although CO₂ emission rates (0.3–1.5 Pg yr<sup>–1</sup>) and by inference the rate of CO₂ accumulation in the 
atmosphere (4–42 ppm per century) during the PETM were at least 4–5 lower than during the modern era 
(from 1995 to 2014, Table 2.1) (Zeebe et al., 2016; Gingerich, 2019).  
 
<figref>5.3</figref> 
 
The last 50 Myr have been characterised by a gradual decline in atmospheric CO₂ levels at a rate of ~16 ppm 
Myr<sup>–1</sup> (Foster et al., 2017; Gutjahr et al., 2017) (Figure 5.3). The exact cause of this long-term change in CO₂ 
remains uncertain, but may be related to an imbalance between long-term sources of CO₂ (volcanic 
outgassing) and long-term sinks (organic carbon burial and silicate weathering). 
 
The most recent time interval when atmospheric CO₂ concentration was as high as 1000 ppm (i.e. similar to 
the end-of 21st century projection for the high-end emission scenario RCP8.5) was around 33.5 Ma, prior to 
the Eocene-Oligocene transition (Zhang et al., 2013; Anagnostou et al., 2016). Atmospheric CO₂ levels then 
reached a critical threshold (1000–750 ppm, (DeConto et al., 2008)) to allow for the development of 
permanent regional ice-sheets on Antarctica, associated with changes in Southern Ocean hydrography, which 
would have increased deep ocean CO₂ storage (Leutert et al., 2020). 
 
The most recent interval characterised by atmospheric CO₂ levels similar to modern (i.e. 360–420 ppm) was 
the Mid-Pliocene warm period (MPWP; 3.3–3.0 Myr, (Martínez-Botí et al., 2015a; de la Vega et al., 2020)) 
(Chapter 2). The relatively high atmospheric CO₂ concentration during the MPWP are related to vigorous 
ocean circulation and a rather inefficient marine biological carbon pump (Burls et al., 2017), which would 
have reduced deep ocean carbon storage. After the MPWP, atmospheric CO₂ concentrations declined 
gradually at a rate of 30 ppm Myr<sup>–1</sup> (de la Vega et al., 2020) (Figure 5.3), as an increase in ocean 
stratification led to enhanced ocean carbon storage, allowing for major, sustained advances in northern 
hemisphere ice sheets, 2.7 Ma (Sigman et al., 2004; DeConto et al., 2008).  
 
 
### 5.1.2.2  Glacial-Interglacial Greenhouse Gases Records 
 
The Antarctic ice core record covering the past 800 kyr provides an important archive to explore the carbon-
climate feedbacks prior to anthropogenic perturbations (Brovkin et al., 2016). Polar ice cores represent the 
only climatic archive from which past GHG concentrations can be directly measured. Major GHGs, CH₄, 
N₂O and CO₂ generally co-vary on orbital timescales (Loulergue et al., 2008; Lüthi et al., 2008; Schilt et al., 
2010) (Chapter 2), with consistently higher atmospheric concentrations during warm intervals of the past, 
pointing to a strong sensitivity to climate (Figure 5.4). Modelling work suggests that the carbon cycle 
contributed to globalise and amplify changes in orbital forcing, which are pacing glacial-interglacial climate 
oscillations (Ganopolski and Brovkin, 2017), with ocean biogeochemistry and physics, terrestrial vegetation, 
peatland, permafrost and exchanges with the lithosphere including chemical weathering, volcanic activity, 
sediment burial and marine calcium carbonate compensation all playing a role in modulating the 
concentration of atmospheric GHGs. 
 
Since AR5, the number of ice core records and the temporal resolution of their data for the last 800 kyr have 
improved, in particular for the last 60 kyr. Additionally, the advent of isotopic measurements on GHGs 
extracted from air trapped in ice, allows for more robust source apportionments and inventory assessments. 
The ensuing discussion will thus mainly focus on these two specific aspects. 
 
Major pre-industrial sources of CH₄ comprise wetlands (including subglacial environments) and biomass 
burning (Bock et al., 2010, 2017; Lamarche-Gagnon et al., 2019; Kleinen et al., 2020). Pre-industrial 
atmospheric N₂O concentrations were regulated by microbial production in marine and terrestrial 
environments and by photochemical removal in the stratosphere (Schilt et al., 2014; Battaglia and Joos, 
2018; Fischer et al., 2019). Pre-industrial atmospheric CO₂ concentrations were largely regulated by 
exchange with exogenic terrestrial and ocean carbon reservoirs. The imbalance between geological sources 
and sinks in the ocean-atmosphere-land biosphere system additionally plays an important role in modulating 
the air-sea partitioning of the active carbon inventory on multi-millennial timescales (Cartapanis et al., 
2018).  
 
<figref>5.4</figref> 
 
Model-based estimates indicate that wetland CH₄ emissions were reduced by 24–40% during the Last 
Glacial Maximum (LGM) when compared to pre-industrial, while CH₄ emissions related to biomass burning 
(wildfires) decreased by 35–75% (Valdes, et al., 2005; Hopcroft et al., 2017; Kleinen et al., 2020). N₂O 
emissions decreased by about 30% during the LGM based on data-constrained model estimates (Schilt et al., 
2014; Fischer et al., 2019b) owing to a combination of a weaker hydrological cycle and a generally better 
ventilated intermediate depth ocean relative to present, reducing (de)nitrification processes (Galbraith and 
Kienast, 2013; Fischer et al., 2019b). 
 
During past ice ages, generally colder and drier climate conditions contributed to a substantial decline of the 
land biosphere carbon inventory, in particular in boreal peatlands (–300 PgC) (Treat et al., 2019). Estimates 
assessing the glacial decrease in the global terrestrial biosphere C stock vary between –300 and –600 PgC 
(Ciais et al., 2012; Peterson et al., 2014; Menviel et al., 2017; Kleinen et al., 2020), possibly –850 PgC when 
accounting for ocean-sediment interactions and burial (Jeltsch-Thömmes et al., 2019), a considerable 
contraction when compared to the modern land biosphere stock. The large range of estimates reflects a yet 
limited understanding on how glacially perturbed nutrient fluxes and soil dynamics, as well as largely 
exposed shelf areas in the tropics as a result of lowered sea-level, altered carbon cycle dynamics. Recent 
estimates suggest deep-sea CO₂ storage during the last ice age exceeded modern values by as much as 750 – 
950 PgC (Skinner et al., 2015; Buchanan et al., 2016; Skinner et al., 2017; Anderson et al., 2019; Gottschalk 
et al., 2020). A combination of increased CO₂ solubility associated with 2–3°C lower mean oceanic 
temperatures (Bereiter et al., 2018), increased oceanic residence time of CO₂ (Skinner et al., 2017), altered 
oceanic alkalinity (Yu et al., 2010a; Cartapanis et al., 2018), and a generally more efficient marine biological 
carbon pump (BCP) (Galbraith and Jaccard, 2015; Yu et al., 2019; Galbraith and Skinner, 2020) enhanced 
the partition CO₂ into the ocean interior, although the relative contribution of each mechanism remains a 
matter of debate. Recent observationally constrained Earth system model results highlight that air-sea 
disequilibrium amplifies the effect of cooling and iron fertilisation on glacial carbon storage (Khatiwala et 
al., 2019).   
 
Ice core observations combined with model-based estimates thus reveal with high confidence that both 
terrestrial and marine CH₄ and N₂O emissions were reduced under glacial climate conditions. Multiple lines 
of evidence indicate with high confidence that enhanced storage of remineralised CO₂ in the ocean interior, 
owing to a combination of synergistic mechanisms, was sufficient to balance the removal of carbon from the 
atmosphere and the terrestrial biosphere reservoirs combined during the last ice age.  
 
Vegetation regrowth and increased precipitation in wetland regions associated with the mid-deglacial 
Northern Hemisphere warming (referred to as the Bølling/Allerød (B/A) warm interval, 14.7–12.7 ka), in 
particular in the (sub)tropics, accounts for large increases in both CH₄ and N₂O emissions to the atmosphere 
(Schilt et al., 2014; Baumgartner et al., 2014; Bock et al., 2017; Fischer et al., 2019). Specifically, changes in 
CH₄ sources were steered by variations in vegetation productivity, source size area, temperatures and 
precipitation as modulated by insolation, local sea-level changes and monsoon intensity (Bock et al., 2017; 
Kleinen et al., 2020). Changes in the CH₄ atmospheric sink term probably only played a secondary role in 
modulating atmospheric CH₄ inventories across the LDT (Hopcroft et al., 2017; Kleinen et al., 2020) 
Geological emissions, related to the destabilisation of fossil (radiocarbon-dead) CH₄ sources buried in 
continental margins as a result of sudden warming appear small (Bock et al., 2017; Petrenko et al., 2017; 
Dyonisius et al., 2020). Stable isotope analysis on N₂O extracted from Antarctic and Greenland ice reveal 
that marine and terrestrial emissions increased by 0.7 ± 0.3 and 1.7 ± 0.3 TgN, respectively, across the LDT 
(Fischer et al., 2019b). During abrupt Northern Hemisphere warmings, terrestrial emissions responded 
rapidly to the northward displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) associated with the 
resumption of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) (Fischer et al., 2019b). About 90% of 
these step increases occurred rapidly, possibly in less than 200 years (Fischer et al., 2019b). In contrast, 
marine emissions increased more gradually, modulated by global ocean circulation reorganisation. 
 
The gradual increase in atmospheric CO₂ across the LDT was punctuated by three centennial 10–13 ppm 
increments, coeval with 100–200 ppb increases in CH₄ (Marcott et al., 2014), reminiscent of similar 
oscillations reported for the last ice age associated with transient warming events (Dansgaard/Oeschger (DO) 
events) (Ahn and Brook, 2014; Rhodes et al., 2017; Bauska et al., 2018) as well as previous deglacial 
transitions (Nehrbass-Ahles et al., 2020). The rate of change in atmospheric CO₂ accumulation during these 
transient events exceed the averaged deglacial growth rates by at least 50% (Table 2.1, Figure 5.4). The early 
deglacial release of remineralised carbon from the ocean abyss coincided with the resumption of Southern 
Ocean overturning circulation (Skinner et al., 2010; Schmitt et al., 2012; Ferrari et al., 2014; Gottschalk et 
al., 2016, 2020; Jaccard et al., 2016; Rae et al., 2018; Moy et al., 2019) and the concomitant reduction in the 
global efficiency of the marine BCP, associated, in part, with dwindling iron fertilisation (Hain et al., 2010; 
Martinez-Garcia et al., 2014; Jaccard et al., 2016) The two subsequent pulses, centred 14.8 and 12.9 ka, are 
associated with enhanced air-sea gas exchange in the Southern Ocean (Li et al., 2020a), iron fertilisation in 
the South Atlantic and North Pacific (Lambert et al., 2021) and rapid increase in soil respiration owing to the 
resumption of AMOC and associated southward migration of the ITCZ (Bauska et al., 2016; Marcott et al., 
2014). Indeed, rapid warming of high northern latitudes contributed to thaw permafrost, possibly liberating 
labile organic carbon to the atmosphere (Köhler et al., 2014; Crichton et al., 2016; Winterfeld et al., 2018; 
Meyer et al., 2019). Ocean surface pH reconstructions indicate that the ocean was oversaturated with respect 
to the atmosphere during the early, mid-LDT (Martínez-Botí et al., 2015b; Shao et al., 2019; Shuttleworth et 
al., 2021), suggesting that ocean sources may have been larger than terrestrial sources then. Over the course 
of the LDT, the decrease in northern hemisphere permafrost carbon stocks has been more than compensated 
by an increase in the carbon stocks of mineral soils, peatland and vegetation (Lindgren et al., 2018; Jeltsch-
Thömmes et al., 2019). The land biosphere was on average a net sink for atmospheric carbon and 
accumulated several hundred Gt of carbon over the LDT. 
 
Detailed investigations reveal that Antarctic air temperatures and more generally Southern Hemisphere 
(30°S–60°S) proxy temperature reconstructions led the rise in pCO₂ at the onset of the LDT, 18 ka ago, by 
several hundred years (Shakun et al., 2012; Chowdhry Beeman et al., 2019). Atmospheric CO₂, on the other 
hand, led reconstructed global average temperature by several centuries (Shakun et al., 2012), corroborating 
the importance of CO₂ as an amplifier of orbitally-driven warming. The phasing between Antarctic air 
temperature and atmospheric GHG concentration changes was nearly synchronous, yet variable, during the 
LDT, owing to the complex nature of the mechanisms modulating the global carbon cycle (Chowdhry 
Beeman et al., 2019). Mean ocean temperature reconstructions, based on noble gas extracted from Antarctic 
ice are closely correlated with Antarctic air temperature and pCO₂ records, emphasising the role the Southern 
Ocean is playing in modulating global climate variability (Bereiter et al., 2018; Baggenstos et al., 2019). 

Enhanced mid-ocean ridge magmatism and/or hydrothermal activity modulated by sea-level rise has recently 
been hypothesised to have contributed to the deglacial CO₂ rise (Crowley et al., 2015; Lund et al., 2016; 
Huybers and Langmuir, 2017; Stott et al., 2019b). While geological carbon release may have affected the 
ocean’s radiocarbon budget (Ronge et al., 2016; Rafter et al., 2019; Stott et al., 2019a), model results suggest 
however that the potential contribution of geological carbon sources to the atmosphere remained small (Roth 
and Joos, 2012; Hasenclever et al., 2017).  
 
Simulations of Earth models of intermediate complexity (EMIC) with coupled glacial-interglacial climate 
and the carbon cycle were able to reproduce first-order changes in the atmospheric CO₂ content for the first 
time in recent years (Ganopolski and Brovkin, 2017; Khatiwala et al., 2019). The most important processes 
accounting for the full deglacial CO₂ amplitude in the models include solubility changes, changes in oceanic 
circulation and marine carbonate chemistry. The effect of the terrestrial carbon cycle, variable volcanic 
outgassing and the temperature dependence on the oceanic remineralisation length scale contribute less than 
15 ppm CO₂ between the glacial and interglacial intervals of the cycles. However, details in the simulated 
response of the marine carbon cycle and atmospheric CO₂ concentrations to changes in ocean circulation 
depend to a large degree on model parametrisation (Gottschalk et al., 2019). 
 
Independent paleoclimatic evidence suggests with high confidence that marine and terrestrial CH₄ and N₂O 
emissions are highly sensitive to climate on (sub)centennial timescales. Limited, yet internally consistent ice 
core measurements indicate with medium confidence that pulsed geologic CH₄ release from continental 
margins associated with warming remained negligible across the LDT. Multiple lines of evidence suggest 
with high confidence that CO₂ was released from the ocean interior on centennial timescales during the LDT 
in response to or associated with warming, contributing to the transition out of the last glacial stage to the 
current interglacial period. 
 
Multiple lines of evidence inferred from marine sediment proxies indicate with low to medium confidence 
that the millennial rates of CO₂ concentration change in the atmosphere during the last 56 Myr were at least 
4-5 times lower than during the last century (Figure 5.3). In spite of uncertainties in ice core reconstructions 
related to delayed enclosure of air bubbles, which tend to smooth the records, there is high confidence that 
the rates of atmospheric CO₂ and CH₄ change during the last century were at least 10 and 5 times faster, 
respectively, than the maximum centennial growth rate averages of those gases during the last 800 kyr (Fig. 
5.4).   
 
### 5.1.2.3  Holocene Changes  
 
Atmospheric GHG concentrations were much less variable during the pre-industrial Holocene (from 11.7 ka 
to 1750). Atmospheric CH₄ concentrations decreased at the beginning of the Holocene, consistent with a 
general weakening of boreal sources (Yang et al., 2017; Beck et al., 2018) and further decline during the 
Mid-Holocene owing to a reduction in Southern Hemisphere emissions concomitant with a southward shift 
of the ITCZ (Singarayer et al., 2011; Beck et al., 2018). Atmospheric CH₄ concentrations increased about 5 
ka, which prompted the hypothesis of an early anthropogenic influence, related to land use changes in 
southeast Asia (Ruddiman et al., 2016). However, stable isotope compositions on CH₄ extracted from 
Greenland and Antarctic ice (Beck et al., 2018) reveal that natural emissions located in the southern tropics 
were responsible for the rise in atmospheric CH₄ concentrations, in line with model simulations (Singarayer 
et al., 2011) thus disputing the early anthropogenic influence on the global CH₄ budget. Atmospheric N₂O 
concentrations increased slightly (20 ppb) across the Holocene, associated with a gradual decline in its 
nitrogen stable isotope composition (Fischer et al., 2019b). The combined signal is consistent with a small 
increase in terrestrial emissions, offset by a reduction in marine emissions (Schilt et al., 2010b; Fischer et al., 
2019b). 
 
The early Holocene decrease in CO₂ concentration by about 5 ppm (Schmitt et al., 2012) has been attributed 
to post-glacial regrowth in terrestrial biomass and a gradual increase in peat reservoirs over the Holocene, 
resulting in the sequestration of several hundred PgC (Yu et al., 2010; Nichols and Peteet, 2019). Peat 
accumulation rates in boreal and temperate regions were higher under warmer summer conditions in the 
early to middle Holocene (Loisel et al., 2014; Stocker et al., 2017). The 20 ppm gradual increase of 
atmospheric CO₂ starting 7 ka has been attributed to a decrease in natural terrestrial biomass due to climate 
change, carbonate compensation and enhanced shallow water carbonate deposition (Menviel and Joos, 2012; 
Brovkin et al., 2016b), consistent with stable carbon isotope measurements on CO₂ extracted from Antarctic 
ice (Elsig et al., 2009; Schmitt et al., 2012). These isotopic measurements do not support an early 
anthropogenic influence on atmospheric CO₂ due to land use change and forest clearing (Ruddiman et al., 
2016). Recent paleoceanographic evidence suggests that remineralised carbon outgassing associated with 
increased Southern Ocean circulation and upwelling (Studer et al., 2018), possibly promoted by stronger 
Southern Hemisphere westerly winds (Saunders et al., 2018), could have additionally contributed to the late 
Holocene increase in atmospheric CO₂ concentrations. However, the role of these mechanisms remained 
insignificant in transient Holocene ESM simulations (Brovkin et al., 2019). Overall, as in AR5 (WGI, 
Chapter 5), there is medium confidence in the key drivers of the CO₂ increase between the early Holocene 
and the beginning of the industrial era yet there is low confidence to the relative contributions of these 
drivers due to insufficient quantitative constraints on particular processes.  
 
# 5.2  Historical Trends, Variability and Budgets of CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O  
 
This section assesses the trends and variability in atmospheric accumulation of the three main GHGs (CO₂, 
CH₄ and N₂O), their ocean and terrestrial sources and sinks as well as their budgets during the Industrial Era 
(1750–2019). Emphasis is placed on the more recent contemporary period (1959–2019) where understanding 
is increasingly better constrained by atmospheric, ocean and land observations. The section also assesses our 
increased understanding of the anthropogenic forcing and processes driving the trends, as well as how 
variability at the seasonal to decadal scales provide insights on the mechanism governing long-term trends 
and emerging biogeochemical-climate feedbacks with their regional characteristics. 
 
 
## 5.2.1   CO₂: Trends, Variability and Budget 
 
### 5.2.1.1  Anthropogenic CO₂ Emissions  
 
There are two anthropogenic sources of CO₂: fossil emissions and net emissions (including removals) 
resulting from land use change and land management (also shown in this chapter as LULUCF: land-use, 
land-use change, and forestry, termed forestry and other land use (FOLU) in previous IPCC reports). Fossil 
CO₂ emissions include the combustion of the fossil fuels coal, oil and gas covering all sectors of the 
economy (electricity, transport, industrial, and buildings), fossil carbonates such as in cement manufacturing, 
and other industrial processes such as the production of chemicals and fertilisers (Figure 5.5a). Fossil CO₂ 
emissions are estimated by combining economic activity data and emission factors, with different levels of 
methodological complexity (tiers) or approaches (e.g., IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas 
Inventories). Several organisations or groups provide estimates of fossil CO₂ emissions, with each dataset 
having slightly different system boundaries, methods, activity data, and emission factors (Andrew, 2020). 
Datasets cover different time periods, which can dictate the datasets and methods that are used for a 
particular application. The data reported here is from an annually updated data source that combines multiple 
sources to maximise temporal coverage (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). The uncertainty in global fossil CO₂ 
emissions is estimated to be ±5% (1 standard deviation). 
 
Fossil CO₂ emissions have grown continuously since the beginning of the industrial era (Figure 5.5) with 
short intermissions due to global economic crises or social instability (Peters et al., 2012; Friedlingstein et 
al., 2020). In the most recent decade (2010–2019), fossil CO₂ emissions reached an average 9.6 ± 0.5 PgC yr-
1 and were responsible for 86% of all anthropogenic CO₂ emissions during. In 2019, fossil CO₂ emissions 
were estimated to be 9.9 ± 0.5 PgC yr<sup>–1</sup> excluding carbonation (Friedlingstein et al., 2020) the highest on 
record. These estimates excluding the cement carbonation sink of around 0.2 PgC yr<sup>–1</sup>. Fossil CO₂ emissions 
grew at 0.9% yr<sup>–1</sup> in the 1990s, increasing to 3.0% per year in the 2000s, and reduced to 1.2% from 2010 to 2019.
The slower growth in fossil CO₂ emissions in the last decade is due to a slowdown in growth from coal 
use. CO₂ emissions from coal use grew at 4.8% yr<sup>–1</sup> in the 2000s, but they slowed to 0.4% yr<sup>–1</sup> in the 2010s. 
CO₂ emissions from oil use grew steadily at 1.1% yr<sup>–1</sup> in both the 2000s and 2010s. CO₂ emissions from gas 
use grew at 2.5% yr<sup>–1</sup> in the 2000s and 2.4% yr<sup>–1</sup> in 2010s, but is showing signs of accelerated growth of 3% 
yr<sup>–1</sup> since 2015 (Peters et al., 2020a). Direct CO₂ emissions from carbonates in cement production are around 
4% of total fossil CO₂ emissions, and grew at 5.8% yr<sup>–1</sup> in the 2000s but a slower 2.4% yr<sup>–1</sup> in the 2010s. The 
uptake of CO₂ in cement infrastructure (carbonation) offsets about one half of the carbonate emissions from 
current cement production (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). These results are robust across the different fossil 
CO₂ emission datasets, despite minor differences in levels and rates as expected given the reported 
uncertainties (Andrew, 2020). During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a rapid, temporary decline in 
fossil CO₂ emissions, estimated to be around 7% based on a synthesis of four estimates. (Forster et al., 2020; 
Friedlingstein et al., 2020; Le Quéré et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020c) (Cross-Chapter Box 6.1). 
 
<figref>5.5</figref> 
 
The global net flux from land use change and land management is composed of carbon fluxes from land use 
conversions, land management and changes therein (Pongratz et al., 2018) and is equivalent to the LULUCF 
fluxes from the agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sector (Jia et al., 2019). It thus consists of 
gross emissions (loss of biomass and soil carbon in clearing or logging, harvested product decay, emissions 
from peat drainage and burning, degradation) and gross removals (CO₂ uptake in natural vegetation re-
growing after harvesting or agricultural abandonment, afforestation). The LULUCF flux relates to direct 
human interference with terrestrial vegetation, as opposed to the natural carbon fluxes occurring due to 
interannual variability or trends in environmental conditions (in particular climate, CO₂, and nutrient 
deposition) (Houghton, 2013).  
 
Progress since AR5 and the SRCCL (IPCC, 2019a) allows more accurate estimates of gross and net fluxes 
due to availability of more models, model advancement in terms of inclusiveness of land-use practices (see 
below), and advanced land use forcings (Ciais et al., 2013; Goldewijk et al., 2017; Hurtt et al., 2020). In 
addition, important terminological discrepancies were resolved. First, synergistic effects of land use change 
and environmental changes have been identified as a key reason for the large discrepancies between model 
estimates of the LULUCF flux, explaining up to 50% of differences (Pongratz et al., 2014; Stocker and Joos, 
2015; Gasser et al. 2020). Another reason for discrepancies relates to natural fluxes being considered as part 
of the LULUCF flux when occurring on managed land in the United Nation Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC) national greenhouse gas inventories; these fluxes are considered part of the 
natural terrestrial sink in global vegetation models and excluded in bookkeeping models (Grassi et al., 2018). 
LULUCF fluxes following national GHG inventories or FAO datasets, including recent estimates (Tubiello 
et al., 2021), are thus excluded from our global assessment, but their comparison against the academic 
approach is available elsewhere (at the global scale (Jia et al., 2019) and European level (Petrescu et al., 
2020).  
 
Land-use-related component fluxes can be verified by the growing databases of global satellite-based 
biomass observations in combination with information on remotely-sensed land cover change, but differ 
from bookkeeping and modelling with Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) in excluding legacy 
emissions from pre-satellite-era land use change and land management, and neglecting soil carbon changes, 
and often focus on gross deforestation, not regrowth (Jia et al., 2019). 
 
For the decade 2010–2019, average emissions were estimated at 1.6 ± 0.7 PgC yr<sup>–1</sup> (mean ± standard 
deviation, 1 sigma) (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). A likely general upward trend since 1850 is reversed during 
the second part of the 20th century (Figure 5.5b). Trends since the 1980s have low confidence because they 
differ between estimates, which is related inter alia to Houghton and Nassikas (2017) using a different land 
use forcing than Hansis et al. (2015) and the DGVMs. Higher emissions estimates are expected from 
DGVMs run under transient environmental conditions compared to bookkeeping estimates, because the 
DGVM estimate includes the loss of additional sink capacity. Because the transient setup requires a 
reference simulation without land use change to separate anthropogenic fluxes from natural land fluxes, 
LULUCF estimates by DGVMs include the sink forests would have developed in response to environmental 
changes on areas that in reality have been cleared (Pongratz et al., 2014). The agricultural areas that replaced 
these forests have a reduced residence time of carbon, lacking woody material, and thus provide a 
substantially smaller additional sink over time (Gitz and Ciais, 2003). The loss of additional sink capacity is 
growing in particular with atmospheric CO₂ and increases DGVM-based LULUCF flux estimates relative to 
bookkeeping estimates over time (Figure 5.5).  
 
Gross emissions are on average 2–3 times larger than the net flux from LULUCF, increasing from an 
average of 3.5 ± 1.2 PgC yr−1 for the decade of the 1960s to an average of 4.4 ± 1.6 PgC yr−1 during 2010–
2019 (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). Gross removals partly balance these gross emissions to yield as the sum 
the net flux from LULUCF and increase from –2.0 ± 0.7 PgC yr−1 for the 1960s to –2.9 ± 1.2 PgC yr−1 
during 2010-2019. These large gross fluxes show the relevance of land management such as harvesting or 
rotational agriculture and the large potential to reduce emissions by halting deforestation and degradation. 
 
More evidence on the pre-industrial LULUCF flux has emerged since AR5 in the form of new estimates of 
cumulative carbon losses until today and of a better understanding of natural carbon cycle processes over the 
Holocene (Ciais et al., 2013). Cumulative carbon losses by land use activities since the start of agriculture 
and forestry (pre-industrial and industrial era) have been estimated at 116 PgC based on global compilations 
of carbon stocks for soils (Sanderman et al., 2017) with about 70 PgC of this occurring prior to 1750, and for 
vegetation as 447 PgC (inner quartiles of 42 calculations: 375–525 PgC) (Erb et al., 2018). Emissions prior 
to 1750 can be estimated by subtracting the post-1750 LULUCF flux from Table 5.1 from the combined soil 
and vegetation losses until today; they would then amount to 328 (161–501) PgC assuming error ranges are 
independent. A share of 353 (310–395) PgC from prior to 1800 has indirectly been suggested as the 
difference between net biosphere flux and terrestrial sink estimates, which is compatible with ice-core 
records due to a low airborne fraction of anthropogenic emissions in pre-industrial times (Erb et al., 2018) 
(see also Section 5.1.2.3). Low confidence is assigned to pre-industrial emissions estimates. 
 
Since AR5, evidence emerged that the LULUCF flux might have been underestimated as DGVMs include 
anthropogenic land cover change, but often ignore land management practices not associated with a change 
in land cover; land management is more widely captured by bookkeeping models through use of 
observation-based carbon densities (Ciais et al., 2013; Pongratz et al., 2018). Sensitivity studies show that 
practices such as wood and crop harvesting increase global net LULUCF emissions (Arneth et al., 2017) and 
explain about half of the cumulative loss in biomass (Erb et al., 2018). 
 
 
### 5.2.1.2  Atmosphere  

Atmospheric CO₂ concentration measurements in remote locations began in 1957 at the South Pole 
Observatory (SPO) and in 1958 at Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO), Hawaii, USA (Keeling, 1960) (Figure 
5.6a). Since then, measurements have been extended to multiple locations around the world (Bacastow et al., 
1980; Conway et al., 1994; Nakazawa et al., 1997). In addition, high density global observations of total 
column CO₂ measurements have been made since 2009 by dedicated greenhouse gases observing satellites 
(Yoshida et al., 2013; O’Dell et al., 2018). Annual mean CO₂ growth rates are observed to be 1.56 ± 0.18 
ppm yr<sup>–1</sup> (average and range from 1 standard deviation of annual values) over the 61 years of atmospheric 
measurements (1959–2019), with the rate of CO₂ accumulation almost tripling from an average of 0.82 ± 
0.29 ppm yr<sup>–1</sup> during the decade of 1960–1969 to 2.39 ± 0.37 ppm yr<sup>–1</sup> during the decade of 2010–2019 
(Chapter 2). The latter agrees well with that derived for total column (XCO₂) measurements by the 
greenhouse gases observing satellite (GOSAT) (Figure 5.6b). The interannual oscillations in monthly-mean 
CO₂ growth rates (Figure 5.6b) show close relationship with the El Niño southern oscillation (ENSO) cycle 
(Figure 5.6b) due to the ENSO-driven changes in terrestrial and ocean CO₂ sources and sinks on the Earth’s 
surface (Section 5.2.1.4).  
 
Multiple lines of evidence unequivocally establish the dominant role of human activities in the growth of 
atmospheric CO₂. First, the systematic increase in the difference between the MLO and SPO records (Figure 
5.6a) is caused primarily by the increase in emissions from fossil fuel combustion in industrialised regions 
that are situated predominantly in the northern hemisphere (Ciais et al., 2019). Second, measurements of the 
stable carbon isotope in the atmosphere (δ13C–CO₂) are more negative over time because CO₂ from fossil 
fuels extracted from geological storage is depleted in 13C (Rubino et al., 2013; Keeling et al., 2017) (Figure 
5.6c). Third, measurements of the δ(O2/N2) ratio show a declining trend because for every molecule of 
carbon burned, 1.17 to 1.98 molecules of oxygen (O2) is consumed (Ishidoya et al., 2012; Keeling and 
Manning, 2014) (Figure 5.6d). These three lines of evidence confirm unambiguously that the atmospheric 
increase of CO₂ is due to an oxidative process (i.e. combustion). Fourth, measurements of radiocarbon (14C–
CO₂) at sites around the world (Levin et al., 2010; Graven et al., 2017; Turnbull et al., 2017) show a 
continued long-term decrease in the 14C/12C ratio. Fossil fuels are devoid of 14C and therefore fossil-fuel-
derived CO₂ additions decrease the atmospheric 14C/12C ratio (Suess, 1955).  
 
 
<figref>5.6</figref>  
 
Over the past six decades, the fraction of anthropogenic CO₂ emissions that has accumulated in the 
atmosphere (referred to as airborne fraction) has remained near constant at approximately 44% (Figure 5.7) 
(Ballantyne et al., 2012; Ciais et al., 2019; Gruber et al., 2019b; Friedlingstein et al., 2020). This suggests 
that the land and ocean CO₂ sinks have continued to grow at a rate consistent with the growth rate of 
anthropogenic CO₂ emissions, albeit with large inter-annual and sub-decadal variability dominated by the 
land sinks (Figure 5.7).  
 
Since AR5, an alternative observable diagnostic to the airborne fraction has been proposed to understand the 
trends in land and ocean sinks in response to its driving atmospheric CO₂ concentrations (Raupach et al., 
2014; Bennedsen et al., 2019). It is the sink rate which is defined as the combined ocean and land sink flux 
per unit of atmospheric excess of CO₂ above pre-industrial levels (Raupach et al., 2014). The sink rate has 
declined over the past six decades, which indicates that the combined ocean and land sinks are not growing 
as fast as the growth in atmospheric CO₂ (Raupach et al., 2014; Bennedsen et al., 2019). Possible 
explanations for the sink rate decline are that the land and/or ocean CO₂ sinks are no longer responding 
linearly with CO₂ concentrations or that anthropogenic emissions are slower than exponential (Gloor et al., 
2010; Raupach et al., 2014; Bennedsen et al., 2019) (Figure 5.7; Sections 5.2.1.3, 5.2.1.4). In addition, both 
diagnostics are influenced by major climate modes (e.g. ENSO) and volcanic eruptions that contribute to 
high interannual variability (Gloor et al., 2010; Frölicher et al., 2013; Raupach et al., 2014), suggesting high 
sensitivity to future climate change. Uncertain land use change fluxes (Section 5.2.1.2) influence the 
robustness of the trends. Based on the AF, it is concluded with medium confidence that both ocean and land 
CO₂ sinks have grown consistent with the rising of anthropogenic emissions. Further research is needed to 
understand the drivers of changes in the CO₂ sink rate.

### 5.2.1.3  Ocean Carbon Fluxes and Storage  
 
Since AR5 and the Special Report on Ocean and the Cryosphere (SROCC), major advances in globally 
coordinated ocean CO₂ observations (Surface Ocean CO₂ Atlas - SOCAT and Global Ocean Data Analysis 
Project - GLODAP), the harmonisation of ocean and coastal observations based products, atmospheric and 
oceanic inversion models and forced global ocean biogeochemical models (GOBMs) have increased the 
level of confidence in the assessment of trends and variability of air-sea fluxes and storage of CO₂ in the 
ocean during the historical period (1960–2018) (Ciais et al., 2013; Bakker et al., 2016; Landschützer et al., 
2020, 2016; Bindoff et al., 2019; Tohjima et al., 2019; DeVries et al., 2019; Gregor et al., 2019; Gruber et 
al., 2019c, 2019a; Olsen et al., 2020; Friedlingstein et al., 2020; Hauck et al., 2020) (See also Supplementary 
Materials 5.SM.1). A major advance since SROCC is that for the first time all 6 published observational 
product fluxes, used in this assessment, are made more comparable using a common ocean and sea-ice cover 
area, integration of climatological coastal fluxes scaled to increasing atmospheric CO₂ and an ensemble 
mean of ocean fluxes calculated from three re-analysis wind products (Landschützer et al., 2014, 2020; 
Rödenbeck et al., 2014; Zeng et al., 2014; Denvil-Sommer et al., 2019; Gregor et al., 2019; Iida et al., 2020) 
Supplementary Materials 5.SM.2). From a process point of view, the ocean uptake of anthropogenic carbon 
is a two-step set of abiotic processes that involves the exchange of CO₂, first across the air-sea boundary into 
the surface mixed layer, followed by its transport into the ocean interior where it is stored for decades to 
millennia, depending on the depth of storage (Gruber et al., 2019a), Two definitions of air-sea fluxes of CO₂ 
are used in this assessment for both observational products and models: Socean is the global mean ocean CO₂ 
sink and Fnet denotes the net spatially varying CO₂ fluxes (Hauck et al., 2020).  Adjustment of the mean 
global Fnet for the pre-industrial sea-to-air CO₂ flux associated with land-to-ocean carbon flux term makes 
Fnet comparable to Socean (Jacobson et al., 2007; Resplandy et al., 2018a; Hauck et al., 2020). 
 
There are multiple lines of observational and modelling evidence that support with high confidence the 
finding that in the historical period air-sea fluxes and storage of anthropogenic CO₂ are largely influenced by 
atmospheric CO₂ concentrations, physical ocean processes and physico-chemical carbonate chemistry, which 
determines the unique properties of CO₂ in sea water (Wanninkhof et al., 2014; DeVries et al., 2017; Gruber 
et al., 2019, 2019a; Hauck et al., 2020; McKinley et al., 2017; 2020; Chapter 9, Cross-Chapter Box 5.3).  
Here we assess three different approaches (Figures 5.8a, 5.8b and 5.9) that together provide high confidence 
that during the historical period (1960–2018) the ocean carbon sink (Socean) and its associated ocean carbon 
storage have grown in response to global anthropogenic CO₂ emissions (Gruber et al., 2019c; Hauck et al., 
2020; McKinley et al., 2020). 
 
 
#### 5.2.1.3.1  Ocean Carbon Fluxes and Storage: Global Multi-Decadal Trends  
In the first assessment approach, the mean global multidecadal (1960–2019) trends in the ocean sink (Socean) 
for CO₂ show a high degree of coherence across the 9 GOBMs and 6 pCO₂-based observational product 
reconstructions (1987–2018), which despite a temporary slowdown (or “hiatus”) in the 1990s, is also quasi-
linear over that period (Figure 5.8a) (Gregor et al., 2019; Hauck et al., 2020). This coherence between the 
GOBMs and observations-based reconstructions (1987–2018; r2=0.85) provides high confidence that the 
ocean sink (Socean in Section 5.2.1.5) evaluated from GOBMs (1960–2019) grew quasi-linearly from 1.0 ± 
0.3 PgC yr<sup>–1</sup> to 2.5 ± 0.6 PgC yr<sup>–1</sup> between the decades 1960–1969 and 2010–2019 in response to global CO₂ 
emissions (Figure 5.8a; Table 5.1; Hauck et al., 2020; Friedlingstein et al., 2020). The cumulative ocean CO₂ 
uptake (105 ± 20 PgC) is 23% of total anthropogenic CO₂ emissions (450 ± 50 PgC) for the same period 
(Friedlingstein et al., 2020). Notwithstanding the high confidence in the magnitude of the annual to decadal 
trends for Socean this assessment is moderated to medium confidence by the low confidence in the currently 
inadequately constrained uncertainties in the pre-industrial land-to-ocean carbon flux, the uncertain 
magnitude of winter outgassing from the Southern Ocean, and the uncertain effect of the ocean surface cool-
skin, the effect of data sparsity, differences between wind products and the uncertain contribution from the 
changing land-ocean continuum on global and regional fluxes (Jacobson et al., 2007; Resplandy et al., 
2018a; Roobaert et al., 2018; Bushinsky et al., 2019; Gloege et al., 2020; Hauck et al., 2020; Watson et al., 
2020). However, both GOBMs and pCO₂-based observational products independently reveal a slowdown or 
“hiatus” of the ocean sink in the 1990s, which provides a valuable constraint for model verification and leads 
to greater confidence in the model outputs (Figure 5.8a) (Landschützer et al., 2016; Gregor et al., 2018; 
DeVries et al., 2019; Hauck et al., 2020). A number of studies point to the role of the Southern Ocean in the 
global “1990s-hiatus” in air-sea CO₂ fluxes but provide different process-based explanations linking ocean 
temperature, mixing and MOC responses to variability in large scale climate systems, wind stress and 
volcanic activity as well as the sensitivity of the air-sea CO₂ flux to small changes in the atmospheric forcing 
from anthropogenic CO₂ (Landschützer et al., 2016; DeVries et al., 2017; Bronselaer et al., 2018; Gregor et 
al., 2018; Gruber et al., 2019c; Keppler and Landschützer, 2019; McKinley et al., 2020; Nevison et al., 
2020). Data sparsity in the Southern Ocean could also be a factor amplifying the global decadal perturbation 
of the 1990s (Gloege et al., 2020). Therefore, while there is high confidence in the 1990’s-hiatus of the 
global ocean sink for anthropogenic CO₂ and that the Southern Ocean makes an observable contribution to it, 
there is still low confidence in the attribution for the processes behind the 1990s-hiatus (5.2.1.3.2).  Observed 
increases in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of ocean pCO₂ and reductions in the mean global buffering 
capacity provide high confidence that growing CO₂ sink is also beginning to drive observable large-scale 
changes in ocean carbonate chemistry (Jiang et al., 2019).  However, there is medium confidence that these 
changes, which depending on the emissions scenario could drive future ocean feedbacks, are still too small to 
emerge from the historical multi-decadal observed growth rate of Socean (Figure 5.8a; Sections 5.1.2; 5.3.2, 
5.4.2; SROCC 5.2.2.3.2) (Bates et al., 2014; Sutton et al., 2016; Fassbender et al., 2017; Landschützer et al., 
2018; Jiang et al., 2019). A recent model-based study suggests that re-emergence of previously stored 
anthropogenic CO₂ is both changing the buffering capacity of the mixed layer and reducing the ocean sink 
for anthropogenic CO₂ during the historical period (Rodgers et al., 2020). This trend is not reflected in 
observations-based products (Figure 5.8), so we attribute a low confidence. 
 
The second assessment approach makes use of 6 independent methods to constrain the mean decadal ocean 
sink over the period 1990–2019 (Figure 5.8b). This provides a multi-decadal advance on the 1990–1999 
decadal constraint from (Denman et al., 2007) that have been widely used as a model constraint for GOBMs 
used for the global carbon budget (Hauck et al., 2020). The medium confidence attributed of this assessment 
of the global multi-decadal trend (Figure 5.8a) is further supported by the broad agreement in magnitude and 
trend of the decadal mean ocean CO₂ uptake with assessments that also include additional observations-
based, independent methods such as ocean CO₂ inversion and atmospheric CO₂ and O2/N2 measurements 
(Figure 5.8b; Supplementary Materials Tables 5.SM.1 and 5.SM.2).  
 
<figref>5.8</figref> 
 
Here we provide a third comparative assessment approach depicting the spatial coherence of ocean air-sea 
fluxes and storage rates of CO₂ as well as a quantitative assessment of both fluxes for the same period 
(1994–2007) (Figure 5.9). Observation-based pCO₂ flux products show that emissions of natural CO₂ occur 
mostly in the tropics and high latitude Southern Ocean, and that the uptake and storage of anthropogenic CO₂ 
occur predominantly in the mid-latitudes (Figure 5.9; Chapter 9; Cross-Chapter Box 5.3). Strong ocean CO₂ 
sink regions are those in the mid-latitudes associated with the cooling of poleward flowing sub-tropical 
surface waters as well as equatorward flowing sub-polar surface waters both of which contribute to the 
formation of Mode, Intermediate and Deep water masses that transport anthropogenic CO₂ into the ocean 
interior on time scales of decades to centuries in both hemispheres (Figure 5.9) (DeVries, 2014; Gruber et 
al., 2019a; Wu et al., 2020; Chapter 9.2.2.3). The mean decadal scale magnitude and uncertainties of Socean 
from net air sea fluxes (Fnet) were calculated from an ensemble of 6 observational based product 
reconstructions (Figure 5.9a) and the storage rates in the ocean interior derived from multiple ocean interior 
CO₂ data sets (Gruber et al., 2019a) (Figure 5.9b). The cumulative CO₂ stored in the ocean interior from 
1800 to 2007 has been estimated at 140 ±18 PgC (Gruber et al., 2019a). As reported in SROCC (Section 
5.2.2.3.1; IPCC, 2019b), the net ocean CO₂ storage between 1994–2007 was 29 ± 4 PgC, which corresponds 
to a mean storage of 26 ± 5% of anthropogenic CO₂ emissions for that period (Gruber et al., 2019a). The 
resulting net annual storage rate of anthropogenic CO₂, equivalent to Socean for the period mid-1994–mid-
2007 is 2.2 ± 0.3 PgCyr<sup>–1</sup>, which is in very close agreement with the top-down air-sea flux estimate of Socean 
of 2.1 ± 0.5 PgC yr<sup>–1</sup> from GOBMs and 1.9 ± 0.3PgC yr<sup>–1</sup> from pCO₂-based observational products with the 
steady river carbon flux correction of 0.62PgCy-1 for the same time period (Gruber et al., 2019b; Hauck et 
al., 2020). This close agreement between these independent ocean CO₂ sink estimates derived from air-sea 
fluxes and storage rates in the ocean interior support the medium confidence assessment that the ocean 
anthropogenic carbon storage rates continue to be determined by the ocean sink (Socean) in response to 
growing CO₂ emissions (McKinley et al., 2020) (Figure 5.9).

#### 5.2.1.3.2  Ocean Carbon Fluxes and Storage: Regional – Global Variability 
The intent of this assessment is to show how global variability can be regionally forced (Gregor et al., 2019; 
Landschützer et al., 2019; Hauck et al., 2020). Since AR5 and SROCC, advances in global ocean CO₂ flux 
products, GOBMs and atmospheric inversion models have strengthened the confidence in the assessment of 
how ocean regions influence mean global variability and trends of ocean CO₂ air-sea fluxes (Fnet; see 
Supplementary Materials Figure 5.SM.1) (Ciais et al., 2013; Landschützer et al., 2014, 2015; Rödenbeck et 
al., 2014; McKinley et al., 2017; Bindoff et al., 2019; Gregor et al., 2019; Friedlingstein et al., 2020; Hauck 
et al., 2020). The coherence in the regional variability of the anomalies in Fnet from 3 independent lines of 
evidence support with high confidence that the non-steady state global interannual-decadal variability of Fnet 
has clear regional influences (Gregor et al., 2019; Landschützer et al., 2019). The tropical oceans contribute 
the most to the global mean interannual variability (Supplementary Materials Figure 5.SM.1d). The high 
latitude oceans, particularly the Southern Ocean, contribute the most to the global-scale decadal variability 
(Supplementary Materials Figure 5.SM5.1b, c; (Landschützer et al., 2016, 2019; Gregor et al., 2019; Gruber 
et al., 2019c; Hauck et al., 2020). The influence of the Southern Ocean on the global mean decadal 
variability and the 1990’s hiatus is supported by the highest regional-global correlation coefficients 
(Supplementary Materials Figures 5.SM.1a, c). In contrast, the Equatorial oceans’ influence on global mean 
Fnet has a low correlation because, notwithstanding the coherence in interannual variability, it does not show 
the same global mean trend of strengthening sink in response to growing global emissions (Supplementary 
Materials Figure 5.SM.1d; (Gregor et al., 2019). All regions, except the Equatorial ocean, contribute to 
varying extents to the multidecadal trend of growth in the global ocean sink (Supplementary Materials 
Figure 5.SM.1). Data sparseness in the high latitudes and the relatively short length of the observational 
records leads to low confidence in the attribution of the processes that link regional-global variability to 
climate (Landschützer et al., 2019; Gloege et al., 2020). 
  
Regional decadal-scale anomalies in the variability of ocean CO₂ storage have also emerged, probably 
associated with changes in the meridional overturning circulation (MOC), which may influence the global 
variability in Fnet (DeVries et al., 2017); Chapter 9). In the interior of the Indian and Pacific sectors of the 
Southern Ocean, and the North Atlantic, the increase in the CO₂ inventory from 1994 to 2007 was about 20% 
smaller than expected from the atmospheric CO₂ increase during the same period and the anthropogenic CO₂ 
inventory in 1994 (Sabine, 2004; Gruber et al., 2019a). There is medium confidence that the ocean CO₂ 
inventory strengthened again in the decade 2005–2015 (DeVries et al., 2017). In the North Atlantic, a low 
rate of anthropogenic CO₂ storage at 1.9 ± 0.4 PgC per decade during the time period of 1989–2003 
increased to 4.4 ± 0.9 PgC per decade during 2003–2014, associated with changing ventilation patterns 
driven by the North Atlantic Oscillation (Woosley et al., 2016). In the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean, 
the rate of anthropogenic CO₂ storage also increased from 8.8 ± 1.1 (1σ) PgC per decade during 1995–2005 
to 11.7 ± 1.1 PgC per decade during 2005–2015 (Carter et al., 2019). However, in the Subantarctic Mode 
Water of the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, the storage rate of the anthropogenic CO₂ was rather 
lower after 2005 than before (Tanhua et al., 2017; Bindoff et al., 2019; Section 9.2.3.2). These changes have 
been predominantly ascribed to the impact of changes in the MOC on the transport of anthropogenic CO₂ 
into the ocean interior due to regional climate variability, in addition to the increase in the atmospheric CO₂ 
concentration (Wanninkhof et al., 2010; Pérez et al., 2013; DeVries et al., 2017, 2019; Gruber et al., 2019b; 
McKinley et al., 2020) (Section 9.2.3.1). However, the low frequency of carbon observations in the interior 
of the vast ocean leads to medium confidence in the assessment of temporal variability in the rate of regional 
ocean CO₂ storage and its controlling mechanisms.   

In summary, multiple lines of both observational and modelling evidence provide high confidence that the 
finding that the ocean sink for anthropogenic CO₂ has increased quasi-linearly over the past 60 years in 
response to growing global emissions of anthropogenic CO₂ with a mean fraction of 23% of total emissions.  
The high confidence assessment is moderated to medium confidence because of a number of as yet to be 
adequately unconstrained ocean CO₂ flux terms.  Observed changes in the variability of ocean pCO₂ and 
observed reductions in the mean global buffering capacity provide high confidence that the growing CO₂ 
sink is also beginning to drive observable large-scale changes in ocean carbonate chemistry.  However, there 
is medium confidence that these changes, which depending on the emissions scenario could drive future 
ocean feedbacks, are still too small to emerge from the historical multi-decadal observed growth rate of 
Socean. 
 
 
### 5.2.1.4  Land CO₂ Fluxes: Historical and Contemporary Variability and Trends  
 
#### 5.2.1.4.1  Trend in Land-Atmosphere CO₂ Exchange  
The global net land CO₂ sink is assessed to have grown over the past six decades (Ciais et al., 2019; Le 
Quéré et al., 2018a; Sarmiento et al., 2010; Friedlingstein et al., 2019) (high confidence). Estimated as the 
residual from the mass balance budget of fossil fuel CO₂ emissions minus atmospheric CO₂ growth and the 
ocean CO₂ sink, the global net land CO₂ sink (including both land CO₂ sink and net land use change 
emission) increased from 0.3 ± 0.6 PgC yr<sup>–1</sup> during the 1960s to 1.8 ± 0.8 PgC yr<sup>–1</sup> during 2010s 
(Friedlingstein et al., 2020). An increasing global net land CO₂ sink since 1980s (Figure 5.10) was 
consistently suggested both by atmospheric inversions (e.g. Peylin et al., 2013) and by Dynamic Global 
Vegetation Models (e.g. Sitch et al., 2015; Friedlingstein et al., 2019). The northern hemisphere contributes 
more to the net increase in the land CO₂ sink compared to the southern hemisphere (Ciais et al., 2019), and 
boreal and temperate forests probably contribute the most (Tagesson et al., 2020). Attributing an increased 
net land CO₂ sink to finer regional scales remains challenging, but inversions of satellite-based column CO₂ 
products that have emerged since AR5 are a promising tool to further constrain regional land-atmosphere 
CO₂ exchange (Ciais et al., 2013; Houweling et al., 2015; Reuter et al., 2017; O’Dell et al., 2018; Palmer et 
al., 2019a). 
 
Carbon uptake by vegetation photosynthesis exerts a first-order control over the net land CO₂ sink. Several 
lines of evidence show enhanced vegetation photosynthesis over the past decades (medium to high 
confidence) (Figure 5.10), including increasing satellite-derived vegetation greenness (e.g. Mao et al., 2016; 
Zhu et al., 2016; Jia et al., 2019; See also Chapter 2) and satellite-derived photosynthesis indicators (e.g. 
Badgley et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018b), change in atmospheric concentration of carbonyl sulphide 
(Campbell et al., 2017), enhanced seasonal CO₂ amplitude (Graven et al., 2013; Forkel et al., 2016).  
observation-driven inference of increasing photosynthesis CO₂ uptake based mostly on enhanced water use 
efficiency (Cheng et al., 2017), and DGVM simulated increase of photosynthesis CO₂ uptake (Anav et al., 
2015).  
 
Substantial progress has been made since AR5 on attributing change of the global net land CO₂ sink. 
Increasing global net land CO₂ sink since the 1980s is mainly driven by the fertilisation effect from rising 
atmospheric CO₂ concentrations (Schimel et al., 2015; Sitch et al., 2015; Fernández-Martínez et al., 2019; 
O’Sullivan et al., 2019; Tagesson et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2020) (medium confidence). Increasing nitrogen 
deposition (de Vries et al., 2009; Devaraju et al., 2016; Huntzinger et al., 2017) or the synergy between 
increasing nitrogen deposition and atmospheric CO₂ concentration (O’Sullivan et al., 2019) could have also 
contributed to the increasing global net land CO₂ sink. The effects of climate change alone on the global net 
land CO₂ sink is so divergent that even the signs of the effects are not the same across DGVMs (e.g. 
Huntzinger et al., 2017).  
 
Lower fire emission of CO₂ and enhanced vegetation carbon uptake due to reduced global burned area have 
contributed to the increasing global net land CO₂ sink in the recent decade (Arora and Melton, 2018; Yin et 
al., 2020) (low to medium confidence). Satellite observations reveal a declining trend in global burned area 
by about 20% over past two decades (Andela et al., 2017; Earl and Simmonds, 2018; Forkel et al., 2019b; 
Jones et al., 2020), a trend most pronounced in regions like northern Africa (Forkel et al., 2019; Zubkova et 
al., 2019; Bowman et al., 2020; Jones et al., 2020) and Mediterranean Europe (Turco et al., 2016). However, 
burned area trends are highly heterogeneous regionally with increasing trends reported in regions like 
western United States (Holden et al., 2018a; Abatzoglou et al., 2019) and southeastern Australia (Canadell et 
al., 2020). Some regions (e.g. Amazon basin and Australia) experienced record-breaking fire events in 2019 
and 2020 (e.g. Boer et al., 2020), whose effects on burned area trends remain to be explored. The burned 
area trends were primarily attributed to both human-induced climate change and human activities (Jolly et 
al., 2015; Andela et al., 2017; Holden et al., 2018b; Turco et al., 2018; Teckentrup et al., 2019; Bowman et 
al., 2020), as well as changing frequency of lightning in the boreal region (Veraverbeke et al., 2017). In 
addition to changes in the burned area, fire dynamics could affect trend in land-atmosphere CO₂ exchange 
indirectly through increasing concentration of air pollutants (Yue and Unger, 2018; Lasslop et al., 2019; see 
Section 6.3.4 for impacts of ozone and aerosol on the carbon cycle).   
 
Significant uncertainties remain on land CO₂ sink partition of processes due to challenges in reconciling 
multiple-scale evidence from experiments to the globe (Fatichi et al., 2019; Walker et al., 2020), due to large 
spatial and inter-model differences in diagnosing dominant driving factors affecting the net land CO₂ sink 
(Huntzinger et al., 2017; Fernández-Martínez et al., 2019), and due to model deficiency in process 
representations (He et al., 2016). Nitrogen dynamics, a major gap in DGVMs identified in AR5, have now 
been incorporated in about half of the DGVMs contributing to the carbon budget of the Global Carbon 
Project (GCP) (see Le Quéré et al., (2018a) for model characteristics) and a growing number of ESMs 
(Arora et al., 2020). However, as the representations of carbon-nitrogen interactions vary greatly among 
models, large uncertainties remain on how nitrogen cycling regulates the response of ecosystem carbon 
uptake to higher atmospheric CO₂ (Davies-Barnard et al., 2020; Walker et al., 2015; Wieder et al., 2019; 
Meyerholt et al., 2020; see Section 5.4.1). Fire modules have been incorporated into 10 of 16 DGVMs 
contributing to the global carbon budget (Le Quéré et al., 2018a), and a growing number of models have 
representations of human ignitions and fire suppression processes (Rabin et al., 2017; Teckentrup et al., 
2019). There are also growing DGVM developments to include management practices (Pongratz et al., 
2018b) and the effects of secondary forest regrowth (Pugh et al., 2019a), though models still under represent 
intensively managed ecosystems, such as croplands and managed forests (Guanter et al., 2014; Thurner et al., 
2017). Processes that have not yet played a significant role in the land CO₂ sink of the past decades but can 
grow in importance, include permafrost (Section 5.4) and peatlands dynamics (Dargie et al., 2017; Gibson et 
al., 2019), have also been incorporated in some DGVMs  (Koven et al., 2015a; Burke et al., 2017a; 
Guimberteau et al., 2018). Growing numbers and varieties of Earth observations are being jointly used to 
drive and benchmark models, helping further identify key processes missing or mechanisms poorly 
represented in the current generation of DGVMs (e.g. Collier et al., 2018).  
 
<figref>5.10</figref>  
 
#### 5.2.1.4.2 
AR5 stated that the interannual variability of the atmospheric CO₂ growth rate is dominated by tropical land 
ecosystems. A set of new satellite measurements applied to assess the variability of the tropical land carbon 
balance since AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013) confirm this statement, including satellite column CO₂ measurements, 
estimating recent anomalous land-atmosphere CO₂ exchange induced by El Niño at continental scale (e.g. 
Liu et al., 2017; Palmer et al., 2019), and L-band vegetation optical depth, estimating tropical above-ground 
biomass carbon stock changes (Fan et al., 2019). In addition, based on medium evidence and medium 
agreement between studies with DGVMs and atmospheric inversions, semi-arid ecosystems over the tropical 
zones have a larger contribution to interannual variability in global land-atmosphere CO₂ exchange than 
moist tropical forest ecosystems (Poulter et al., 2014; Ahlstrom et al., 2015; Piao et al., 2020) (low to 
medium confidence).  
 
Understanding the mechanisms driving interannual variability in the carbon cycle has the potential to provide 
insights into whether and to what extent the carbon cycle can affect the climate (carbon-climate feedback), 
with particular interests over the highly climate-sensitive tropical carbon cycle (e.g. Cox et al., 2013a; Fang 
et al., 2017; Humphrey et al., 2018; Jung et al., 2017a; Malhi et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2014; see Section 
5.4). Consistent findings from studies with atmospheric inversions, satellite observations and DGVMs (e.g. 
Malhi et al., 2018; Rödenbeck et al., 2018) lead to high confidence that the tropical net land CO₂ sink is 
reduced under warmer and drier conditions, particularly during El Niño events. Interannual variations in 
tropical land-atmosphere CO₂ exchange are significantly correlated with anomalies of tropical temperature, 
water availability and terrestrial water storage (Wang et al., 2014; Jung et al., 2017; Humphrey et al., 2018; 
Piao et al., 2020), whose relative contribution are difficult to separate due to covariations between these 
climatic factors. At continental scale, the dominant climatic driver of interannual variations of tropical land-
atmosphere CO₂ exchange was temperature variations (Figure 5.11;  Piao et al., 2020), which could partly 
result from the spatial compensation of the water availability effects on land-atmospheric CO₂ exchange 
(Jung et al., 2017).

### 5.2.1.5  CO₂ Budget 
 
The global CO₂ budget (Figure 5.12) encompasses all natural and anthropogenic CO₂ sources and sinks.  
Table 5.1 shows the perturbation of the global carbon mass balance between reservoirs since the beginning 
of the industrial era, circa 1750.  
 
Since AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013), a number of improvements have led to a more constrained carbon budget 
presented here. Some new additions include: (i) the use of independent estimates for the residual carbon sink 
on natural terrestrial ecosystems (Le Quéré et al., 2018a), (ii) improvements in the estimates of emissions 
from cement production (Andrew, 2019) and the sink associated with cement carbonation (Cao et al., 2020), 
(iii) improved and new emission estimates from forestry and other land use (Hansis et al., 2015; Gasser et al., 
2020), (iv) the use of ocean observation-based sink estimates and a revised river flux partition between 
hemisphere (Friedlingstein et al., 2020); and (v) the expansion of constraints from atmospheric inversions, 
both based on surface networks and the use of satellite retrievals.  
 
The budget, based on the annual assessment by the GCP (Friedlingstein et al., 2020), uses independent 
estimates of all major flux components: fossil fuel and carbonate emissions (EFOS), CO₂ fluxes from Forestry 
and other Land Use (ELULUCF), the growth rate of CO₂ in the atmosphere (Gatm), and the ocean (Socean) and 
natural land (Sland) CO₂ sinks. An imbalance term (BImb) is required to ensure mass balance of the source and 
sinks that have been independently estimated: EFOS + ELULUCF = Gatm + Socean + Sland. + BImb. All estimates are 
reported with 1 standard deviation (±1σ, 1 sigma) representing a likelihood of 68%. 

Over the past decade (2010–2019), 10.9 ± 0.9 PgC yr<sup>–1</sup> were emitted from human activities which were 
distributed between three Earth system components: 46% accumulated in the atmosphere (5.1 ± 0.02 PgC yr-
1), 23% was taken up by the ocean (2.5 ± 0.6 PgC yr<sup>–1</sup>) and 31% was stored by vegetation in terrestrial 
ecosystems (3.4 ± 0.9 PgC yr<sup>–1</sup>) (Table 5.1). There is a budget imbalance of 0.1 PgCyr<sup>–1</sup> which is within the 
uncertainties of the other terms. Over the industrial era (1750–2019), the total cumulative CO₂ fossil fuel and 
industry emissions were 445 ± 20 PgC, and the LULUCF flux (=net land use change in Figure 5.12) was 240 
± 70 PgC (medium confidence). The equivalent total emissions (685 ± 75 PgC) was distributed between the 
atmosphere (285 ± 5 PgC), oceans (170 ± 20 PgC) and land (230 ± 60 PgC) (Table 5.1), with a budget 
imbalance of 20 PgC. 
 
This budget (Table 5.1) does not explicitly account for source/sink dynamics due to carbon cycling in the 
land–ocean aquatic continuum comprising freshwaters, estuaries, and coastal areas. Natural and 
anthropogenic transfers of carbon from soils to freshwater systems are significant (2.4–5.1 PgC yr<sup>–1</sup>) 
(Regnier et al., 2013a; Drake et al., 2018). Some of the carbon is buried in freshwater bodies (0.15 PgC) 
(Mendonça et al., 2017), and a significant proportion returns to the atmosphere via outgassing from lakes, 
rivers  and estuaries (Raymond et al., 2013; Regnier et al., 2013a; Lauerwald et al., 2015). The net export of 
carbon from the terrestrial domain to the open oceans is estimated to be 0.80 PgC yr<sup>–1</sup> (medium confidence), 
based on the average of (Jacobson et al., 2007; Resplandy et al., 2018b) and corrected to account for 0.2 PgC 
buried in ocean floor sediments. These terms are included in Figure 5.12. Inclusion of other smaller fluxes 
could further constrain the carbon budget (Ito, 2019; Friedlingstein et al., 2020).

## 5.2.2  CH₄: Trends, Variability and Budget  
 
Methane is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than CO₂ (Chapter 7) and participates in tropospheric air 
chemistry (Chapter 6). The CH₄ variability in the atmosphere is mainly the result of the net balance between 
the sources and sinks on the Earth’s surface and chemical losses in the atmosphere. Atmospheric transport 
evens out the regional CH₄ differences between different parts of the Earth’s atmosphere. The steady-state 
lifetime is estimated to be 9.1 ± 0.9 (Chapter 6, Section 3.1). About 90% of the loss of atmospheric CH₄ 
occurs in the troposphere by reaction with hydroxyl (OH) radical, 5% by bacterial soil oxidation, and the rest 
5% by chemical reactions with OH, excited state oxygen (O1D), and atomic chlorine (Cl) in the stratosphere 
(Saunois et al., 2020). Methane has large emissions from both natural and anthropogenic origins, but a clear 
demarcation of their nature is difficult because of the use and conversions of the natural ecosystem for 
human activities. The largest natural sources are from wetlands, freshwater and geological process, while the 
largest anthropogenic emissions are from enteric fermentation and manure treatment, landfills and waste 
treatment, rice cultivation and fossil fuel exploitation (Table 5.2). In the past two centuries, CH₄ emissions 
have nearly doubled, predominantly human driven since 1900, and persistently exceeded the losses (virtually 
certain), thereby increasing the atmospheric abundance as evidenced from the ice core and firn air 
measurements (Ferretti et al., 2005; Ghosh et al., 2015).  
 
This section discusses both bottom-up and top-down estimates of emissions and sinks. Bottom-up estimates 
are based on empirical upscaling of point measurements, emission inventories and dynamical model 
simulations, while top-down estimates refer to those constrained by atmospheric measurements and 
chemistry-transport models in inversion systems. Since the AR5, a larger suite of atmospheric inversions 
using both in situ and remote sensing measurement have led to better understanding of the regional CH₄ 
sources (Cross-Chapter Box 5.2). New ice core measurements of 14C-CH₄ are used for estimating the 
geological sources of CH₄ (Table 5.2). Compared to the IPCC SRCCL (IPCC, 2019a; Jia et al., 2019), we 
provide a whole atmospheric sources-sinks budget consisting of all emissiones and losses.   
 
 
### 5.2.2.1  Atmosphere 
 
Since the start of direct measurements of CH₄ in the atmosphere in the 1970s (Figure 5.13), the highest 
growth rate was observed from 1977 to 1986 at 18 ± 4 ppb yr<sup>–1</sup> (multi-year mean and 1 standard deviation) 
(Rice et al., 2016). This rapid CH₄ growth followed the green revolution with increased crop-production and 
a fast rate of industrialisation that caused rapid increases in CH₄ emissions from ruminant animals, rice 
cultivation, landfills, oil and gas industry and coal mining (Ferretti et al., 2005; Ghosh et al., 2015; Crippa et 
al., 2020). Due to increases in oil prices in the early 1980s, emissions from gas flaring declined significantly 
(Stern and Kaufmann, 1996). This explains the first reduction in CH₄ growth rates from 1985 to 1990 (Steele 
et al., 1992; Chandra et al., 2021). Further reductions in emission occurred following the Mt Pinatubo 
eruption in 1991 that triggered a reduction in CH₄ growth rate through a decrease in wetland emissions 
driven by lower surface temperatures due to the scattering aerosols (Bândă et al., 2016; Chandra et al., 2021). 
In the late 1990s through 2006 there was a temporary pause in the CH₄ growth rate, with higher confidence 
on its causes than the in AR5: emission from the oil and gas sectors declined by about 10 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup> through the 
1990s, and atmospheric CH₄ loss steadily increased (Dlugokencky et al., 2003; Simpson et al., 2012; Crippa 
et al., 2020; Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2020; Chandra et al., 2021). Methane growth rate began to increase 
again at 7 ± 3 ppb yr<sup>–1</sup> during 2007–2016, the causes of which are highly debated since the AR5 (Rigby et 
al., 2008; Dlugokencky et al., 2011; Dalsøren et al., 2016; Nisbet et al., 2016; Patra et al., 2016; Schaefer et 
al., 2016; Schwietzke et al., 2016; Turner et al., 2017; Worden et al., 2017; He et al., 2020); studies disagree 
on the relative contribution of thermogenic, pyrogenic and biogenic emission processes and variability in 
tropospheric OH concentration. The renewed CH₄ increase is accompanied by a reversal of δ13C trend to 
more negative values post 2007; opposite to what occurred in the 200 years prior (Ferretti et al., 2005; Ghosh 
et al., 2015; Schaefer et al., 2016; Schwietzke et al., 2016; Nisbet et al., 2019), suggesting an increasing 
contribution from animal farming, landfills and waste, and a slower increase in emissions from fossil fuel 
exploitation since the early 2000s (Patra et al., 2016; Jackson et al., 2020; Chandra et al., 2021). A 
comprehensive assessment of the CH₄ growth rates over the past 4 decades is presented in the Cross-Chapter 
Box 5.2. 
 
<figref>5.13</figref> 
 
### 5.2.2.2  Anthropogenic CH₄ emissions 
 
The positive gradient between CH₄ at Cape Grim, Australia (41oS) and Trinidad Head, USA (41oN), and the 
bigger difference between Trinidad Head and global mean CH₄ compared to that between global mean CH₄ 
and Cape Grim, strongly suggest that the northern hemisphere is the dominant origin of anthropogenic CH₄ 
emissions (Figure 5.13). The loss rate of CH₄ in troposphere does not produce a large positive north-south 
hemispheric gradient in CH₄ due to parity in hemispheric mean OH concentration (Patra et al., 2014) or in 
the case of greater OH concentrations in the northern than the southern hemisphere as simulated by the 
chemistry-climate models (Naik et al., 2013). Coal mining contributed about 35% of the total CH₄ emissions 
from all fossil fuel related sources. Top-down estimates of fossil fuel emissions (106 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup>) are smaller 
than bottom-up estimates (115 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup>) during 2008–2017 (Table 5.2). Inventory-based estimates suggest that 
CH₄ emissions from coal mining increased by 17 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup> between the periods 2002–2006 and 2008–2012, 
with a dominant contribution from China (Peng et al., 2016; Crippa et al., 2020; Höglund-Isaksson et al., 
2020). Furthermore, top-down estimates suggest emissions from China’s coal mines have continued to grow 
at a slower rate after 2010 (Miller et al., 2019; Chandra et al., 2021). Emissions from oil and gas extraction 
and use decreased in the 1980s and 1990s, but increased in the 2000s and 2010s (Dlugokencky et al., 1994; 
Stern and Kaufmann, 1996; Howarth, 2019; Crippa et al., 2020). The attribution to multiple CH₄ source 
using spatially aggregated atmospheric δ13C data remained underdetermined to infer the global total 
emissions from the fossil fuel industry, biomass burning and agriculture (Rice et al., 2016; Schaefer et al., 
2016; Schwietzke et al., 2016; Worden et al., 2017; Thompson et al., 2018).      
 
In the agriculture and waste sectors (Table 5.2), livestock production has the largest emission source (109 Tg 
yr<sup>–1</sup> in 2008–2017) dominated by enteric fermentation by about 90%. Methane is formed during the storage 
of manure, when anoxic conditions are developed (Hristov et al., 2013). Emissions from enteric fermentation 
and manure have increased gradually from about 87 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup> in 1990–1999 to 109 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup> in 2008–2017 
mainly due to the increase in global total animal numbers. Methane production in livestock rumens (cattle, 
goats, sheep, water buffalo) are affected by the type, amount and quality of feeds, energy consumption, 
animal size, health and growth rate, meat and milk production rate, and temperature (Broucek, 2014; 
Williams et al., 2015; IPCC SRCCL 5.4.3). Waste management and landfills produced 64 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup> in 2008–
2017, with global emissions increasing steadily since the 1970s and despite significant declines in US, 
western Europe and Japan (Crippa et al., 2020; Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2020).  
 
Emissions from rice cultivation decreased from about 45 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup> in the 1980s to about 29 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup> in the 2000-
2009 but increased again slightly to 31 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup> during 2008–2017 based inventories data. However, 
ecosystem models showed a gradual increase with time due to climate change (limited evidence, low 
agreement) (Crippa et al., 2020; Höglund-Isaksson et al., 2020; Ito, 2020).  
 
Biomass burning and biofuel consumption (including both natural and anthropogenic processes) caused at 
least 30 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup> emissions during 2008–2017 and constituted up to about 5% of global anthropogenic CH₄ 
emissions. Methane emissions from open biomass burning decreased during the past two decades mainly due 
to reduction of burning in savanna, grassland and shrubland (van der Werf et al., 2017; Worden et al., 2017). 
There is recent evidence from the tropics that fire occurrence is non-linearly related to precipitation, 
implying that severe droughts will increase CH₄ emissions from fires, particularly from the degraded 
peatlands (Field et al., 2016).

### 5.2.2.3  Land Biospheric Emissions and Sinks 

Freshwater wetlands are the single largest global natural source of CH₄ into the atmosphere, accounting for 
about 26% of the total CH₄ source (robust evidence, medium agreement). Progress has been made since AR5 
(Ciais et al., 2013) in better constraining freshwater lake and river emissions and reducing double counting 
with wetland emissions. Bottom-up and top-down estimates for 2008–2017 are 149 and 180 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup>, 
respectively, with a top-down uncertainty range of 159–199 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup> (Table 5.2). The large uncertainties stem 
from challenges in mapping wetland area and temporal dynamics, and in scaling methane production, 
transport and consumption processes, that are measured with small chambers or flux towers, to landscape 
estimates (Pham-Duc et al., 2017). Both the top-down and bottom-up estimates presented in Table 5.2 
indicate little increase in wetland CH₄ emissions during the last three decades, with the new estimates being 
slightly smaller than in AR5 due to updated wetland maps and ecosystem model simulations (Melton et al., 
2013; Poulter et al., 2017). The wetland emissions show strong interannual variability due to the changes in 
inundated land area, air temperature and microbial activity (Bridgham et al., 2013). Present terrestrial 
ecosystem model simulated CH₄ emission variability does not produce strong correlation with the ENSO 
cycle (Cross-Chapter Box 5.2, Figure 2), although observation evidence is emerging for lower CH₄ 
emissions during El Niños and greater emissions during the La Niña (Pandey et al., 2017).    
 
Trees in upland and wetland forests contribute to CH₄ emissions by abiotic production in the canopy, by the 
methanogenesis taking place in the stem, and by conducting CH₄ from soil into the atmosphere (Covey and 
Megonigal, 2019). There is emerging evidence of the important role of trees in transporting and conducting 
CH₄ from soils into the atmosphere especially in tropics (Pangala et al., 2017), whereas direct production of 
CH₄ by vegetation only has a minor contribution (limited evidence, high agreement) (Bruhn et al., 2012; 
Covey and Megonigal, 2019). The contribution of trees in transporting CH₄ may further widen the gap 
between the bottom-up and top-down estimates in the global budget, particularly needing a reassessment of 
emissions in the tropics and in forested wetlands of temperate and boreal regions (Pangala et al., 2017; 
Jeffrey et al., 2019; Welch et al., 2019; Sjögersten et al., 2020).  
 
Microbial methane uptake by soil comprises up to 5% (30 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup>) of the total CH₄ sink in 2008–2017 (Table 
5.2). There is evidence from experimental and modelling studies of increasing soil microbial uptake due to 
increasing temperature (Yu et al., 2017), although evidence for decreasing CH₄ consumption, possibly linked 
to precipitation changes, also exist (Ni and Groffman, 2018). The estimate of global methane loss by 
microbial oxidation in upland soils has been lowered marginally by 4 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup>, compared to 34 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup> in 
AR5, for the period 2000–2009. Termites, an infraorder of insects (Isoptera) found in almost all landmasses, 
emitted about 9 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup> of CH₄ in 2000–2009, and increased emissions from the insects and other anthropods 
are projected (Brune, 2018).  
 
 
### 5.2.2.4  Ocean and Inland Water Emissions and Sinks 
 
In AR5, the ocean CH₄ emissions were reported together with geological emissions summing up to 54 (33–
75) Tg yr<sup>–1</sup>. Coastal oceans, fjords and mud volcanos are major source of CH₄ in the marine environment, but 
CH₄ flux measurements are sparse. Saunois et al. (2020) estimate that the oceanic budget, including 
biogenic, geological and hydrate emissions from coastal and open ocean, is 6 (range 4–10) Tg yr<sup>–1</sup> for the 
2000s, which is in good agreement with an air-sea flux measurement-based estimate of 6–12 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup> (Weber 
et al., 2019). When estuaries are included, the total oceanic budget is 9–22 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup>, with a mean value of 13 
Tg yr<sup>–1</sup>. A recent synthesis suggests that CH₄ emissions from shallow coastal ecosystems, particularly from 
mangroves, can be as high as 5–6 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup> (Al‐Haj and Fulweiler, 2020). The reservoir emissions, including 
coastal wetlands and tidal flats, contribute up to 13 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup> (Borges and Abril, 2011; Deemer et al., 2016). 
Methane seepage from the Arctic shelf, possibly triggered by the loss of geological storage due to warming 
and thawing of permafrost and hydrate decomposition, has a wide estimated range of 0.0–17 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup> 
(Shakhova et al., 2010, 2014, 2017; Berchet et al., 2016); advanced eddy covariance measurements put the 
best estimate at just about 3 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup> from the East Siberian Arctic shelf (Thornton et al., 2020). The current 
flux is expected to be a mix of pre-industrial and climate change-driven fluxes, CH₄ seepage is anticipated to 
increase in a warmer world (Dean et al., 2018). 
 
All geological sources around the world, including the coastal oceans and fjords, are estimated to emit CH₄ 
in the range of 35–76 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup> (Etiope et al., 2019). There is evidence that the ventilation of geological CH₄ is 
likely to be smaller than 15 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup> (Petrenko et al., 2017; Hmiel et al., 2020). A lower geological CH₄ 
ventilation will reduce the gap between bottom-up estimations and that are used in top-down models (Table 
5.2), but widen the gap in the ratio of fossil-fuel derived sources to the biogenic sources for matching the 
∆14C-CH₄ observations.   
 
Inland water (lakes, rivers, streams, ponds, estuaries) emissions are proportionally the largest source of 
uncertainty in the CH₄ budget. Since AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013), the inland water CH₄ source has been revised 
from 8–73 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup> (1980s) to 117–212 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup> (2000s) with the availability of more observational data and 
improved areal estimates (Bastviken et al., 2011; Deemer et al., 2016; Stanley et al., 2016; DelSontro et al., 
2018; Saunois et al., 2020). A large spatial and temporal variation in lake and river CH₄ fluxes (Wik et al., 
2016; Crawford et al., 2017; Natchimuthu et al., 2017) and uncertainties in the global area of them (Allen 
and Pavelsky, 2018), together with a relatively small number of observations, varying measurement 
methods, for example those neglecting ebullition, varying upscaling methods and lack of appropriate process 
make the bottom-up CH₄ emission estimate uncertain (Sanches et al., 2019; Engram et al., 2020; Zhang et 
al., 2020a). Accordingly, there is no clear accounting of inland waters in top-down budgets, which is the 
main reason for the large gap in bottom-up and top-down estimates of “other sources” in the CH₄ budget 
(Table 5.2). Despite recent progress in separating wetlands from inland waters, there is double-counting in 
the bottom-up estimates of their emissions (Thornton et al., 2016). Although there is evidence that regional 
human activities and warming both increase inland water CH₄ emissions (Beaulieu et al., 2019), the increase 
in the decadal emissions since AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013) rather reflect improvements in the estimate (medium 
confidence), due to updates in the datasets and new upscaling approaches (Saunois et al., 2020).  
 
 
### 5.2.2.5  CH₄ Budget 
 
A summary of top-down and bottom-up estimations of CH₄ emissions and sinks for the period 2008–2017 is 
presented in Figure 5.14 (details in Table 5.2 and the associated text for the emissions). In addition to 483-
682 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup> loss of CH₄ in the troposphere by reaction with OH, 1–35 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup> of CH₄ loss is estimated to 
occur in the lower troposphere due to Cl but are not included in the top-down models as shown in Table 5.2 
(Hossaini et al., 2016; Gromov et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019b). The decadal mean CH₄ burden/imbalance 
have increased at the rate of 30, 12, 7 and 21 Tg yr<sup>–1</sup> in the 1980s (1980–1989), 1990s (1990–1999), 2000s 
(2000–2009) and the most recent decade (2008–2017), respectively (virtually certain), as can be estimated 
from observed atmospheric growth rate (Cross-Chapter Box 5.2, Figure 1).  
 
Recent analysis using ∆14C-CH₄ in ice samples suggest that CH₄ emissions from fossil fuels exploitation are 
responsible for 30% of total CH₄ emissions (Lassey et al., 2007; Hmiel et al., 2020), which is largely 
inconsistent with sectorial budgets where fossil fuel emissions add up to 20% only (Ciais et al., 2013). 
However, recent model simulations produce fairly consistent δ13C-CH₄ values and trends as observed in the 
atmospheric samples using 20% fossil fuel emission fraction (Ghosh et al., 2015; Warwick et al., 2016; 
Fujita et al., 2020; Strode et al., 2020). Further research is needed in order to clarify relative roles of CH₄ 
emissions from fossil fuel exploitation and freshwater components. A key challenge is to accommodate 
higher estimated emissions from these two components without a major increase in the sinks for explaining 
the carbon and hydrogen isotopes variabilities at the same time.

## 5.2.3  N₂O: Trends, Variability and Budget 
 
In natural ecosystems, nitrous oxide (N₂O) is primarily produced as a by-product during the remineralisation 
of organic matter via the primary processes of nitrification and denitrification (Butterbach-Bahl et al., 2013; 
Voss et al., 2013). The net N₂O production is highly sensitive to local environmental conditions such as 
temperature, oxygen concentrations, pH and the concentrations of ammonium and nitrate, amongst others, 
causing strong variability of N₂O emissions in time and space even at small scales. Changes in the 
atmospheric abundance of N₂O result largely from the balance of the net N₂O sources on land and ocean, and 
the photochemical destruction of N₂O in the stratosphere.  
 
Since AR5 (WGI, 6.4.3), improved understanding of N₂O sources allows for a more comprehensive 
assessement of the global N₂O budget (Table 5.3). This progress is based on extended atmospheric 
observations (Francey et al., 2003; Elkins et al., 2018; Prinn et al., 2018), improved atmospheric N₂O 
inversions (Saikawa et al., 2014; Thompson et al., 2019), updated and expanded inventories of N₂O sources 
(Janssens-Maenhout et al., 2017; Winiwarter et al., 2018), as well as improved bottom-up estimate of 
freshwater, ocean and terrestrial sources (Martinez-Rey et al., 2015; Landolfi et al., 2017; Buitenhuis et al., 
2018a; Lauerwald et al., 2019; Maavara et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2019). 
 
The human perturbation of the natural nitrogen cycle through the use of synthetic fertilisers and manure, as 
well as nitrogen deposition resulting from land-based agriculture and fossil fuel burning has been the largest 
driver of the increase in atmospheric N₂O of 31.0 ± 0.5 parts per billion (ppb) (10%) between 1980 and 2019 
(robust evidence, high agreement) (Tian et al., 2020). The long atmospheric lifetime of N₂O implies that it 
will take more than a century before atmospheric abundances stabilise after the stabilisation of global 
emissions. The rise of atmospheric N₂O is of concern, not only because of its contribution to the 
anthropogenic radiative forcing (see Chapter 7), but also because of the importance of N₂O in stratospheric 
ozone loss (Ravishankara et al., 2009; Fleming et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2014a). 
 
 
### 5.2.3.1  Atmosphere 
 
The tropospheric abundance of N₂O was 332.1 ± 0.4 ppb in 2019 (Figure 5.15), which is 23% higher than 
pre-industrial levels of 270.1 ± 6.0 ppb (robust evidence, high agreement). Current estimates are based on 
atmospheric measurements with high accuracy and density (Francey et al., 2003; Elkins et al., 2018; Prinn et 
al., 2018), and pre-industrial estimates are based on multiple ice-core records (see Section 2.2.3.2.3). The 
average annual tropospheric growth rate was 0.85 ± 0.03 ppb yr<sup>–1</sup>
 during the period 1995 to 2019 (Figure 
5.15a). The atmospheric growth rate increased by about 20% between the decade of 2000 to 2009 and the 
most recent decade of 2010 to 2019 (0.95 ± 0.04 ppb yr<sup>–1</sup>) (robust evidence, high agreement). The growth 
rate in 2010–2019 was also higher than during 1970–2000 (0.6–0.8 ppb yr<sup>–1</sup> (Ishijima et al., 2007)) and the 
thirty-year period prior to 2011 (0.73 ± 0.03 ppb yr<sup>–1</sup>), as reported by AR5. New evidence since AR5 (WGI, 
6.4.3) confirms that in the tropics and sub-tropics, large inter-annual variations in the atmospheric growth 
rate are negatively correlated with the multivariate ENSO index (MEI) and associated anomalies in land and 
ocean fluxes (Ji et al., 2019; Thompson et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020c) (Figure 5.15a). 
 
As assessed by SRCCL (IPCC, 2019a), combined firn, ice, air and atmospheric measurements show that the 
15N/14N isotope ratio (robust evidence, high agreement) as well as the predominant position of the 15N atom 
in atmospheric N₂O (limited evidence, low agreement) in N₂O has changed since 1940 (Figure 5.15b, c) 
whereas they were relatively constant in the pre-industrial period (Ishijima et al., 2007; Park et al., 2012; 
Prokopiou et al., 2017, 2018). SRCCL concluded that this change indicates a shift in the nitrogen-substrate 
available for de-nitrification, and the relative contribution of nitrification to the global N₂O source (robust 
evidence, high agreement), which are associated with increased fertiliser use in agriculture (Park et al., 2012; 
Snider et al., 2015; Prokopiou et al., 2018).  
 
Since AR5 (WGI, 6.4.3), the mean atmospheric lifetime of N₂O has been revised to 116 ± 9 years (Prather et 
al., 2015). The small negative feedback of the N₂O lifetime to increasing atmospheric N₂O results in a 
slightly lower residence time (109 ± 10 years) of N₂O perturbations compared with that assessed by AR5 
(118–131 years) (Prather et al., 2015). The dominant N₂O loss occurs through photolysis and oxidation by 
O(1D) radicals in the Stratosphere and amounts to approximately 13.1 (12.4–13.6) TgN yr<sup>–1</sup> (Minschwaner et 
al., 1993; Prather et al., 2015; Tian et al., 2020).  
 
<figref>5.15</figref> 

 
### 5.2.3.2  Anthropogenic N₂O Emissions 
 
AR5 (WGI, 6.4.3) and SRCCL (2.3.3) concluded that agriculture is the largest anthropogenic source of N₂O 
emissions. Since SRCCL (2.3.3), a new synthesis of inventory-based and modelling studies shows that the 
widespread use of synthetic fertilisers and manure on cropland and pasture, manure management and 
aquaculture resulted in 3.8 (2.5–5.8) TgN yr<sup>–1</sup> (average 2007–2016) (robust evidence, high agreement) 
(Table 5.3) (Winiwarter et al., 2018; FAO, 2019; Janssens-Maenhout et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2020). 
Observations from field-measurements (Song et al., 2018), inventories (Wang et al., 2020) and atmospheric 
inversions (Thompson et al., 2019) further corroborate the assessment of the SRCCL that there is a non-
linear relationship between N₂O emissions and nitrogen input, implying an increasing fraction of fertiliser 
lost as N₂O with larger fertiliser excess (medium evidence, high agreement). Several studies using 
complementary methods indicate that agricultural N₂O emissions have increased by more than 45% since the 
1980s (high confidence) (Davidson, 2009; Janssens-Maenhout et al., 2017; Winiwarter et al., 2018; Tian et 
al., 2020) (Figure 5.16, Table 5.3), mainly due to the increased use of nitrogen fertiliser and manure. N₂O 
emissions from aquaculture are amongst the fastest rising contributors of N₂O emissions, but their overall 
magnitude is still small in the overall N₂O budget (Tian et al., 2020).  
 
 
<figref>5.16</figref> 
 
The principal non-agricultural anthropogenic sources of N₂O are industry, specifically chemical processing, 
wastewater, and the combustion of fossil fuels (Table 5.3). Industrial emissions of N₂O mainly due to nitric 
and adipic acid production have decreased in North America and Europe since the wide-spread installation 
of abatement technologies in the 1990s (Pérez-Ramı́rez et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2011; Janssens-Maenhout et 
al., 2019). There is still considerable uncertainty in industrial emissions from other regions of the world with 
contrasting trends between inventories (Thompson et al., 2019). Globally, industrial emissions and emissions 
from fossil fuel combustion by stationary sources, such as power plants, as well as smaller emissions from 
mobile sources (e.g. road transport and aviation) have remained nearly constant between1980s and 2007-
2016 (moderate evidence, medium agreement) (Janssens-Maenhout et al., 2017; Winiwarter et al., 2018; 
Tian et al., 2020). Wastewater N₂O emissions, including those from domestic and industrial sources have 
increased from 0.2 (0.1–0.3) TgN yr<sup>–1</sup> to 0.35 (0.2–0.5) TgN yr<sup>–1</sup> between the 1980s and 2007–2016 (Tian et 
al., 2020).  
 
Biomass burning from crop residue burning, grassland, savannah and forest fires, as well as biomass burnt in 
household stoves, releases N₂O during the combustion of organic matter. Updated inventories since AR5 
(WGI, 6.4.3) result in a lower range of the decadal mean emissions of 0.6 (0.5–0.8) TgN yr<sup>–1</sup> (van der Werf et 
al., 2017; Tian et al., 2020). The attribution of grassland, savannah or forest fires to natural or anthropogenic 
origins is uncertain, preventing a separation of the biomass burning source into natural and anthropogenic.  


### 5.2.3.3  Emissions from Ocean, Inland Water Bodies and Estuaries  
 
Since AR5 (WGI, 6.4.3), new estimates of the global ocean N₂O source derived from ocean biogeochemistry 
models are 3.4 (2.5–4.3) TgN yr<sup>–1</sup> for the period 2007-2016 (Manizza et al., 2012; Suntharalingam et al., 
2012; Martinez-Rey et al., 2015; Landolfi et al., 2017; Buitenhuis et al., 2018a; Tian et al., 2020) (Figure 
5.16). This is slightly lower than climatological estimates from empirically based-methods and surface ocean 
data syntheses (Bianchi et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2020c). Nitrous oxide processes in coastal upwelling zones 
continue to be poorly represented in global estimates of marine N₂O emissions (Kock et al., 2016), but may 
account for an additional 0.2 to 0.6 TgN yr<sup>–1</sup> of the global ocean source (Seitzinger et al., 2000; Nevison et 
al., 2004).  
 
In the oxic ocean (> 97% of ocean volume), nitrification is believed to be the primary N₂O source (Freing et 
al., 2012). In sub-oxic ocean zones (see Section 5.3), where denitrification prevails, higher N₂O yields and 
turnover rates make these regions potentially significant sources of N₂O (Arévalo-Martínez et al., 2015; 
Babbin et al., 2015; Ji et al., 2015). The relative proportion of ocean N₂O from oxygen-minimum zones is 
highly uncertain (Zamora et al., 2012). Estimates derived from in situ sampling, particularly in the eastern 
tropical Pacific, suggest significant fluxes from these regions, and potentially accounting for up to 50% of 
the global ocean source (Codispoti, 2010; Arévalo-Martínez et al., 2015; Babbin et al., 2015). However, 
recent global-scale analyses estimate lower contributions (4 to 7%, Battaglia and Joos, 2018; Buitenhuis et 
al., 2018). Further investigation is required to reconcile these estimates and provide improved constraints on 
the N₂O source from low-oxygen zones.  
 
Atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic N on oceans can stimulate marine productivity and influence 
ocean emissions of N₂O. New ocean model analyses since AR5 (WGI, 6.4.3), suggest a relatively modest 
global potential impact of 0.01–0.32 TgN yr<sup>–1</sup> (pre-industrial to present-day) equivalent to 0.5–3.3% of the 
global ocean N₂O source (Suntharalingam et al., 2012; Jickells et al., 2017; Landolfi et al., 2017). However, 
larger proportionate impacts are predicted in nitrogen-limited coastal and inland waters down-wind of 
continental pollution outflow, such as the Northern Indian Ocean (Jickells et al., 2017; Suntharalingam et al., 
2019). 
 
Inland waters and estuaries are generally sources of N₂O as a result of nitrification and denitrification of 
dissolved inorganic nitrogen, however, they can serve as N₂O sinks in specific conditions (Webb et al., 
2019). Since AR5 (WGI, 6.4.3), improved emission factors including their spatio-temporal scaling, and 
consideration of transport within the aquatic system allow to better constrain these emissions (Murray et al., 
2015; Hu et al., 2016; Lauerwald et al., 2019; Maavara et al., 2019; Kortelainen et al., 2020; Yao et al., 
2020). Despite uncertainties because of the side-effects of canals and reservoirs on nutrient cycling, these 
advances permit to attribute a fraction of inland water N₂O emissions to anthropogenic sources (Tian et al., 
2020), which contributes to the increased anthropogenic share of the global N₂O source in this report 
compared to AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013). As indirect consequence of agricultural nitrogen-use and waste-water 
treatment, the anthropogenic emissions from inland waters have increased by about a quarter (0.1 TgN yr<sup>–1</sup>) 
between the 1980s and 2007–2016 (Tian et al., 2020).  
 
 
### 5.2.3.4  Emissions and Sinks in Non-Agricultural Land 
 
Soils are the largest natural source of N₂O, arising primarily from nitrogen processing associated with 
microbial nitrification and denitrification (Butterbach-Bahl et al., 2013; Snider et al., 2015) (Table 5.3). 
Under some conditions, soils can also act as a net sink of N₂O, but this effect is small compared to the 
overall source (Schlesinger, 2013). Since AR5 (WGI, 6.4.3), improved global process-based models (Tian et 
al., 2019) suggest a present-day source of 6.7 (5.3–8.1) TgN yr<sup>–1</sup> (2007–2016 average), which is consistent 
with the estimate in AR5. Process-based models and inventory-based methods show that increased N 
deposition has enhanced terrestrial N₂O emissions by 0.8 (0.4–1.4 TgN yr<sup>–1</sup>) relative to approximately pre-
industrial times, and by 0.2 (0.1–0.2) TgN yr<sup>–1</sup> between the 1980s and 2007–2016 (limited evidence, medium 
agreement) (Figure 5.16) (Tian et al., 2019). This estimate is at the high end of the range reported in AR5 
(WGI, 6.4.3). Model projections further show that global warming has led to increased soil N₂O emissions of 
0.8 (0.3–1.3) TgN yr<sup>–1</sup> since approximately pre-industrial times, of which about half occurred since the 1980s 
(limited evidence, high agreement) (Tian et al., 2019, 2020).  
 
SRCCL assessed that deforestation and other forms of land-use change significantly alter terrestrial N₂O 
emissions through emission pulses following conversions, resulting generally in long-term reduced 
emissions in unfertilised ecosystems (medium evidence, high agreement). This conclusion is supported by a 
recent study demonstrating that the deforestation-pulse effect is offset by the effect of reduced area of mature 
tropical forests (Tian et al., 2020). 
 
Uncertainties remain in process-based models with respect to their ability to capture the complicated 
responses of terrestrial N₂O emissions to rain pulses, freeze-thaw cycles and the net consequences of 
elevated levels of CO₂ accurately (Tian et al., 2019). Emerging literature suggests that permafrost thaw may 
contribute significantly to arctic N₂O emissions (Voigt et al., 2020), but these processes are not yet 
adequately represented in models and upscaling to large-scale remains a significant challenge.  
 
 
### 5.2.3.5  N₂O budget 
 
<figref>5.17</figref> 
 
The synthesis of bottom-up estimates of N₂O sources (Sections 5.2.3.2–5.2.3.4; Figure 5.17) yields a global 
source of 17.0 (12.2–23.5) TgN yr<sup>–1</sup> for the years 2007–2016 (Table 5.3). This estimate is comparable to 
AR5, but the uncertainty range has been reduced primarily due to improved estimates of ocean and 
anthropogenic N₂O sources. Since AR5 (WGI, 6.4.3), improved capacity to estimate N₂O sources from 
atmospheric N₂O measurements by inverting models of atmospheric transport provides a new and 
independent constraint for the global N₂O budget (Saikawa et al., 2014; Thompson et al., 2019; Tian et al., 
2020). The decadal mean source derived from these inversions is remarkably consistent with the bottom-up 
global N₂O budget for the same period, however, the split between land and ocean sources based on 
atmospheric inversions is less well constrained, yielding a smaller land source of 11.3 (10.2–13.2) TgN yr<sup>–1</sup> 
and a larger ocean source of 5.7 (3.4–7.2) TgN yr<sup>–1</sup>, respectively, compared to bottom-up estimates.  
 
Supported by multiple studies and extensive observational evidence (Sections 5.2.3.2–5.2.3.4; Figure 5.17), 
anthropogenic emissions contributed about 40% (7.3; uncertainty range: 4.2–11.4 TgN yr<sup>–1</sup>) to the total N₂O 
source in 2007–2016 (high confidence). This estimate is larger than in AR5 (WGI, 6.4.3) due to a larger 
estimated effect of nitrogen deposition on soil N₂O emission and the explicit consideration of the role of 
anthropogenic nitrogen in determining inland water and estuary emissions.  
 
Based on bottom-up estimates, anthropogenic emissions from agricultural nitrogen use, industry and other 
indirect effects have increased by 1.7 (1.0–2.7) TgN yr<sup>–1</sup> between the decades 1980–1989 and 2007–2016, 
and are the primary cause of the increase in the total N₂O source (high confidence). Atmospheric inversions 
indicate that changes in surface emissions rather than in the atmospheric transport or sink of N₂O are the 
cause for the increased atmospheric growth rate of N₂O (robust evidence, high agreement) (Thompson et al., 
2019). However, the increase of 1.6 (1.4–1.7) TgN yr<sup>–1</sup> in global emissions between 2000–2005 and 2010–
2015 based on atmospheric inversions is somewhat larger than bottom-up estimates over the same period, 
primarily because of differences in the estimates of land-based emissions.

## 5.2.4  The Relative Importance of CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O 
 
The total influence of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) on the Earth’s radiative balance is driven by 
the combined effect of those gases, and the three most important were discussed separately in the previous 
sections. This section compares the balance of the sources and sinks of these three gases and their regional 
net flux contributions to the radiative forcing. CO₂ has multiple residence times in the atmosphere from one 
year to many thousands of years (Box 6.1 in Ciais et al. (2013)), and N₂O has a mean lifetime of 116 years. 
They are both long-lived GHGs, while CH₄ has a lifetime of 9.0 years and is considered a short-lived GHGs 
(see Chapter 2 for lifetime of GHGs, Chapter 6 for CH₄ chemical lifetime, and Chapter 7 for effective 
radiative forcing of all GHGs). 
 
Figure 5.18 shows the contribution to radiative forcing of CO₂, CH₄, N₂O, and the halogenated species since 
the 1900s and the more recent decades. For the period 1960–2019, the relative contribution to the total 
effective radiative forcing (ERF) was 63% for CO₂, 11% for CH₄, 6% for N₂O, and 17% for the halogenated 
species (Chapter 7; Figure 5.18). The systematic decline in the relative contribution to ERF for CH₄ since 
1850 is caused by slower increase rate of CH₄ in the recent decades, at 6, 10 and 5 ppb yr<sup>–1</sup> during 1850-
2019, 1960–2019 and 2000–2019, respectively, in comparison with the increasing rate of CO₂ (at 0.7, 1.6 
and 2.2 ppm yr<sup>–1</sup>, respectively) and N₂O (at 0.4, 0.7 and 0.9 ppb yr<sup>–1</sup>, respectively) (Figure 5.4). Owing to the 
shorter lifetime of CH₄, the effect of reduction in emission increase rate on the ERF increase is evident at 
inter-decadal timescales.   
 
<figref>5.18</figref> 
 
Atmospheric abundance of GHGs is proportional to their emissions-loss budgets in the Earth’s environment. 
There are multiple metrics to evaluate the relative importance of different GHGs for the global atmospheric 
radiation budget and the socioeconomic impacts (Section 7.6). Metrics for weighting emissions are further 
developed in the AR6 of IPCC WGIII. Figure 5.19 shows the regional emissions of the three main GHGs. 
For East Asia, Europe, Temperate North America and West Asia, the most dominant GHG source is CO₂ 
(high confidence) (Figure 5.19), while for East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Tropical South America, 
Temperate North America and Central Africa is CH₄ (Figure 5.19). The N₂O emissions are dominant in 
regions with intense use of nitrogen fertilisers in agriculture. Only boreal North America showed net sinks of 
CO₂, while close to flux neutrality is observed for North Asia, Southern Africa, and Australasia. Persistent 
emission of CO₂ is observed for Tropical and South America, northern Africa, and southeast Asia (medium 
confidence). The medium confidence arises from large uncertainties in the estimated non-fossil fuel CO₂ 
fluxes over these regions due to the lack of high-quality atmospheric measurements.

# 5.3  Ocean Acidification and Deoxygenation 
 
The surface ocean has absorbed a quarter of all anthropogenic CO₂ emissions mainly through physical-
chemical processes (McKinley et al., 2016; Gruber et al., 2019b; Friedlingstein et al., 2020). Once dissolved 
in seawater, CO₂ reacts with water and forms carbonic acid. In turn carbonic acid dissociates, leading to a 
decrease in the concentration of carbonate (CO3
hydrogen (H+) ion concentration, which has caused a shift in the carbonate chemistry towards a less basic 
state, commonly referred to as ocean acidification (Caldeira and Wickett, 2003; Orr et al., 2005; Doney et 
al., 2009). Although the societal concern for this problem is relatively recent (about the last 20 years), the 
physical-chemical basis for the ocean absorption (sink) of atmospheric CO₂ has been discussed much earlier 
by Revelle and Suess (1957). The AR5 and SROCC assessments were of robust evidence that the H+ ion 
concentration is increasing in the surface ocean, thereby reducing seawater pH (= - log[H+]) (Orr et al., 2005; 
Feely et al., 2009; Ciais et al., 2013; Bindoff et al., 2019; Chapter 2, Section 2.3.4.1), and there is high 
confidence that ocean acidification is impacting marine organisms (Bindoff et al., 2019).  
 
Ocean oxygen decline, or deoxygenation, is driven by changes in ocean ventilation and solubility (Bindoff et 
al., 2019). It is virtually certain that anthropogenic forcing has made a substantial contribution to the ocean 
heat content increase over the historical period (Bindoff et al., 2019; IPCC, 2019c) (Chapter 9, Section 
2.3.3.1), strengthening upper water column stratification. Ocean warming decreases the solubility of 
dissolved oxygen in seawater, and it contributes to about 15% of the dissolved oxygen decrease in the oceans 
according to estimates based on solubility and the recent SROCC assessment (medium confidence), 
especially in sub-surface waters, between 100–600 m depth (Helm et al., 2011; Schmidtko et al., 2017; 
Breitburg et al., 2018; Oschlies et al., 2018) (SROCC, Section 5.3.1). Stratification reduces the ventilation 
flux into the ocean interior, contributing to most of the remaining ocean deoxygenation (Schmidtko et al., 
2017; Breitburg et al., 2018) (Section 3.6.2). Deoxygenation may enhance the emissions of nitrous oxide, 
especially from oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) or hypoxic coastal areas (Breitburg et al., 2018; Oschlies et 
al., 2018). Since SROCC (Bindoff et al.,  2019), CMIP6 model simulation results agree with the reported 2% 
loss (4.8 ± 2.1 Pmoles O2) in total dissolved oxygen in the upper ocean layer (100–600 m) for the 1970–2010 
period (Helm et al., 2011; Ito et al., 2017; Schmidtko et al., 2017; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020) (Section 
2.3.4.2). The response of marine organisms to the coupled effects of ocean warming, acidification and 
deoxygenation occur at different metabolic levels on different groups, and include respiratory stress and 
reduction of thermal tolerance by organisms (Gruber, 2011; Bindoff et al., 2019; IPCC, 2019c; Kawahata et 
al., 2019). An assessment of these effects on marine biota is found in WGII AR6 Chapter 2⁠. 
 
This section assesses past events of ocean acidification and deoxygenation (Section 5.3.1), the historical 
trends and spatial variability for the upper ocean (Section 5.3.2) and the ocean interior (Section 5.3.3). Future 
projections for ocean acidification and the drivers in the coastal ocean are assessed in Sections 5.3.4 and 
5.3.5, respectively. 
 
 
## 5.3.1  Paleoclimate Context 
 
### 5.3.1.1  Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum 
 
The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) was an episode of global warming exceeding pre-
industrial temperatures by 4°C–8°C (McInerney and Wing, 2011; Dunkley Jones et al., 2013) that occurred 
55.9–55.7 Ma. The PETM involved a large pulse of  geologic CO₂ released into the ocean-atmosphere 
system in 3–20 kyr (Zeebe et al., 2016; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Kirtland Turner et al., 2017; Kirtland Turner, 
2018; Gingerich, 2019) (5.2.1.1). In response to carbon emissions during the PETM, observationally-
constrained model simulations report an increase in atmospheric CO₂ concentrations ranging from about 900 
ppm to >2000 ppm (Gutjahr et al., 2017; Cui & Schubert, 2018; Anagnostou et al., 2020) (Chapter 2). The 
PETM thus provides a test for our understanding of the ocean’s response to the increase in carbon (and heat) 
emissions over geologically short timescales. 
 
A limited number of independent proxy records indicate that the PETM was associated with a surface ocean 
pH decline ranging from 0.15 to 0.30 units (Gutjahr et al., 2017; Penman et al., 2014; Babila et al., 2018). It 
was also accompanied by a rapid (<10 ka) shallowing of the carbonate saturation horizon, resulting in the 
widespread dissolution of sedimentary carbonate, followed by a gradual (100 kyr) recovery (Zachos et al., 
2005; Bralower et al., 2018). The remarkable similarity among sedimentary records spanning a wide range of 
ecosystems suggests with medium confidence that the perturbation in the ocean carbonate saturation was 
global (Babila et al., 2018) and directly resulted from elevated atmospheric CO₂ levels. The degree of 
acidification is similar to the 0.4 pH unit decrease projected for the end of the 21st century under RCP8.5 
(Gattuso et al., 2015) and is estimated to have occurred at a rate about one order of magnitude slower than 
the current rate of ocean acidification (Zeebe et al., 2016). There is low confidence in the inferred rates of 
ocean acidification inherent to the range of uncertainties affecting rates estimates based on marine sediments 
(Section 5.1.2.1).  
 
Recent model outputs as well as globally distributed geochemical data reveal with medium confidence 
widespread ocean deoxygenation during the PETM (Dickson et al., 2012; Winguth et al., 2012; Dickson et 
al., 2014; Chang et al., 2018; Remmelzwaal et al., 2019), with parts of the ocean potentially becoming 
drastically oxygen-depleted (anoxic) (Yao et al., 2018; Clarkson et al., 2021). Deoxygenation affected the 
surface ocean globally (including the Arctic Ocean) (Sluijs et al., 2006), due to vertical and lateral expansion 
of Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZs) (Zhou et al., 2014) that resulted from warming and related changes in 
ocean stratification. Expansion of OMZs may have stimulated N₂O production through water-column 
(de)nitrification (Junium et al., 2018). The degree to which N₂O production impacted PETM warming, 
however, has not yet been established.  
 
The feedbacks associated with recovery from the PETM are uncertain, yet could include drawdown 
associated with silicate weathering (Zachos et al., 2005) and regrowth of terrestrial and marine organic 
carbon stocks (Bowen and Zachos, 2010; Gutjahr et al., 2017). 
 
 
### 5.3.1.2  Last Deglacial Transition 
 
The Last deglacial transition (LDT) is the best documented climatic transition in the past associated with a 
substantial atmospheric CO₂ rise ranging from 190 to 265 ppm between 18–11 ka (Marcott et al., 2014). The 
amplitude of the deglacial CO₂ rise is thus on the order of magnitude of the increase undergone since the 
industrial revolution.  
 
Boron isotope (δ11B) data suggest a 0.15–0.05 unit decrease in sea-surface pH (Hönisch and Hemming, 
2005; Henehan et al., 2013) across the LDT, an average rate of decline of about 0.002 units per century 
compared with the current rate of more than 0.1 units per century (Bopp et al., 2013; Gattuso et al., 2015). 
Planktonic foraminiferal shell weights decreased by 40% to 50% (Barker & Elderfield, 2002), and coccolith 
mass decreased by about 25% (Beaufort et al., 2011) across the LDT. Independent proxy reconstructions 
thus highlight with high confidence that pH values decreased as atmospheric CO₂ concentrations increased 
across the LDT. There is however low confidence in the inferred rate of ocean acidification owing to 
multiple sources of uncertainties affecting rates estimates based on marine sediments (Section 5.1.2.1).  
Geochemical and micropaleontological evidence suggest that intermediate-depth OMZs almost vanished 
during the LGM (Jaccard et al., 2014). However, multiple lines of evidence suggest with medium confidence 
that the deep (>1500 m) ocean became depleted in O2 (concentrations were possibly lower than 50 μmol kg-
1) globally (Jaccard and Galbraith, 2012; Hoogakker et al., 2015, 2018, Gottschalk et al., 2016, 2020; 
Anderson et al., 2019) as a combined result of sluggish ventilation of the ocean subsurface (Gottschalk et al., 
2016, 2020; Skinner et al., 2017) and a generally more efficient marine biological carbon pump (Buchanan et 
al., 2016; Yamamoto et al., 2019; Galbraith and Skinner, 2020).  
 
During the LDT, deep ocean ventilation increased as Antarctic bottom water (AABW) (Skinner et al., 2010; 
Gottschalk et al., 2016; Jaccard et al., 2016) and subsequently the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation 
(McManus et al., 2004; Lippold et al., 2016) resumed, transferring previously sequestered remineralised 
carbon from the ocean interior to the upper ocean and eventually the atmosphere (Skinner et al., 2010; 
Galbraith and Jaccard, 2015; Gottschalk et al., 2016; Ronge et al., 2016; Sikes et al., 2016; Rae et al., 2018; 
Ronge et al., 2020), contributing to the deglacial CO₂ rise. Intermediate depths lost oxygen as a result of 
sluggish ventilation and increasing temperatures (decreasing saturation) as the world emerged from the last   
Glacial period OMZs underwent a large volumetric increase at the beginning of the Bølling-Allerød (B/A), a 
northern-hemisphere wide warming event, 14.7 ka (Jaccard and Galbraith, 2012; Praetorius et al., 2015) with 
deleterious consequences for benthic ecosystems (e.g. Moffitt et al., 2015). These observations indicate with 
high confidence that the rate of warming, affecting the solubility of oxygen and upper water column 
stratification, coupled with changes in subsurface ocean ventilation impose a direct control on the degree of 
ocean deoxygenation, implying a high sensitivity of ocean oxygen loss to warming. The expansion of OMZs 
contributed to a widespread increase in water column (de)nitrification (Galbraith et al., 2013), which 
contributed substantially to enhanced marine N₂O emissions (Schilt et al., 2014; Fischer et al., 2019). 
Nitrogen stable isotope measurements on N₂O extracted from ice cores suggest that approximately one third 
(on the order of 0.7 ± 0.3 TgN yr<sup>–1</sup>) of the deglacial increase in N₂O emissions relates to oceanic sources 
(Schilt et al., 2014; Fischer et al., 2019). 
 
 
## 5.3.2  Historical Trends and Spatial Characteristics in the Upper Ocean 
 
### 5.3.2.1  Reconstructed Centennial Ocean Acidification Trends 
 
Ocean pH timeseries are are based on the reconstruction of coral boron isotope ratios (δ11B). A majority of 
coral δ11B data have been generated from the western Pacific region with a few records from the Atlantic 
Ocean. Biweekly resolution paleo-pH records show monsoonal variation of about 0.5 pH unit in the South 
China Sea (Liu et al., 2014). Interannual ocean pH variability in the range of 0.07–0.16 pH unit characterises 
southwest Pacific corals that are attributed to ENSO (Wu et al., 2018a) and river runoff (D’Olivo et al., 
2015). Decadal (10, 22 and 48-year) ocean pH variations in the southwest Pacific have been linked to the 
Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, causing variations of up to 0.30 pH unit in the Great Barrier Reef (Pelejero 
et al., 2005; Wei et al., 2009) but weaker (about 0.08 pH unit) in the open ocean (Wu et al., 2018a). Decadal 
variations in the South China Sea ocean pH changes of 0.10–0.20 also have been associated with the 
variation in the East Asian monsoon (Liu et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2015), as a weakening of the Asian winter 
monsoon leads to sluggish water circulation within the reefs, building up localised CO₂ concentration in the 
water due to calcification and respiration.  
 
Since the beginning of the industrial period in the mid-19th century, coral δ11B-derived ocean pH has 
decreased by 0.06–0.24 pH unit in the South China Sea (Liu et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2015) and 0.12 pH unit 
in the southwest Pacific (Wu et al., 2018a). Since the mid-20th century, a distinct feature of coral δ11B 
records relates to ocean acidification trends, albeit having a wide-range of values: 0.12–0.40 pH unit in the 
great barrier reef (Wei et al., 2009; D’Olivo et al., 2015), 0.05–0.08 pH unit in the northwest Pacific (Shinjo 
et al., 2013) and 0.04–0.09 pH unit in the Atlantic Ocean (Goodkin et al., 2015; Fowell et al., 2018). 
Concurrent coral carbon isotopic (δ13C) measurements infer ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO₂ from the 
combustion of fossil fuel, based on the lower abundance of 13C in fossil fuel carbon. Western Pacific coral 
records show depleted δ13C trends since the late 19th century that are more prominent since the mid-20th 
century (high confidence) (Pelejero, 2005; Wei et al., 2009; Shinjo et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014; Kubota et 
al., 2017; Wu et al., 2018).  
 
Overall, many of the records show a highly variable seawater pH underlaying strong imprints of internal 
climate variability (high confidence), and in most instances superimposed on a decreasing δ11B trend that is 
indicative of anthropogenic ocean acidification in recent decades (medium confidence). The robustness of 
seawater pH reconstructions is currently limited by the uncertainty on the calibration of  the δ11B proxy in 
different tropical coral species. 
 
 
### 5.3.2.2  Observations of Ocean Acidification over the Recent Decades 
 
SROCC (Section 5.2.2.3) indicated it is virtually certain that the ocean has undergone acidification globally 
in response to ocean CO₂ uptake and concluded that pH in open ocean surface water has changed by a 
virtually certain range of –0.017 to –0.027 pH units per decade since the late 1980s. Since SROCC, 
continued observations of seawater carbonate chemistry at ocean time series stations and compiled shipboard 
studies providing temporally resolved and methodologically consistent datasets have further strengthened the 
evidence of the progress of acidification across all regions of the oceans (Jiang et al., 2019) (Figure 5.20; 
Supplementary Material Table 5.SM.3) (Section 2.3.3.5). 
 
In the subtropical open oceans, decreases in pH have been reported with a very likely range of rate from –
0.016 to –0.019 pH units per decade since 1980s, which equate to approximately 4 % increase in hydrogen 
ion concentration ([H+]) per decade. Accordingly, the saturation state Ω (=[Ca2+][CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>]/Ksp of seawater
with respect to calcium carbonate mineral aragonite has been declining at rates ranging from –0.07 to –0.12 
per decade (González-Dávila et al., 2010; Feely et al., 2012; Bates et al., 2014; Takahashi et al., 2014; Ono 
et al., 2019; Bates and Johnson, 2020) (Supplementary Material Table 5.SM.3). These rates are consistent 
with the  rates expected from the transient equilibration with increasing atmospheric CO₂ concentrations, but 
the variability of rate in decadal time-scale has also been detected with robust evidence (Ono et al., 2019; 
Bates and Johnson, 2020). In the tropical Pacific, its central and eastern upwelling zones exhibited a faster 
pH decline of –0.022 to –0.026 pH unit per decade due to increased upwelling of CO₂-rich sub-surface 
waters in addition to anthropogenic CO₂ uptake (Sutton et al., 2014; Lauvset et al., 2015). By contrast, warm 
pool in the western tropical Pacific exhibited slower pH decline of –0.010 to –0.013 pH unit per decade 
(Supplementary Material Table 5.SM.3) (Lauvset et al., 2015; Ishii et al., 2020). Observational and modeling 
studies (Nakano et al., 2015; Ishii et al., 2020) consistently suggest that slower acidification in this region is 
attributable to the anthropogenic CO₂ taken up in the extra-tropics around a decade ago and transported to 
the tropics via shallow meridional overturning circulations. 

In open subpolar and polar zones, the very likely range (–0.003 to –0.026 pH unit per decade) and 
uncertainty (up to 0.010) observed in pH decline are larger than in the subtropics, reflecting the complex 
interplay between physical and biological forcing mechanisms (Olafsson et al., 2009; Midorikawa et al., 
2012; Bates et al., 2014; Takahashi et al., 2014; Lauvset et al., 2015; Wakita et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the 
high agreement of pH decline among these available time-series studies leads to high confidence in the trend 
of acidification in these zones. In the Arctic Ocean, a temporally limited time series of carbonate chemistry 
measurements prevents drawing robust conclusions on ocean acidification trends. However, the carbonate 
saturation state Ω is generally low, and observational studies show with robust evidence that the recent 
extensive melting of sea ice leading to enhanced air-sea CO₂ exchange, large freshwater inputs, together with 
river discharge and glacial drainage, as well as the degradation of terrestrial organic matter in seawater, 
result in the decline of Ω of aragonite to undersaturation (Bates et al., 2009; Chierici and Fransson, 2009; 
Yamamoto-Kawai et al., 2009; Azetsu-Scott et al., 2010; Robbins et al., 2013; Fransson et al., 2015; 
Semiletov et al., 2016; Anderson et al., 2017; Qi et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2020; Beaupré-Laperrière et al., 
2020) (SROCC Section 3.2.1.2.4, IPCC, (2019b)). The low saturation state of aragonite (Ω~1) has also been 
observed in surface waters of the Antarctic coastal zone associated with freshwater input from glacier 
(Mattsdotter Björk et al., 2014) and with upwelling of deep water (Hauri et al., 2015) as well as along eastern 
boundary upwelling systems (Feely et al., 2016a). 
 
Overall, in agreement with SROCC, it is virtually certain from these observational studies that ocean surface 
waters undergo acidification globally with the CO₂ increase in the atmosphere. These sustained 
measurements over the past decades and campaign studies of ocean carbonate chemistry also highlight with 
robust evidence that trends of acidification have been modulated by the variability and changes in physical 
and chemical states of ocean including those affected by the warming of the cryosphere, requiring their 
improved understandings.

## 5.3.3  Ocean Interior Change 
 
### 5.3.3.1  Ocean Memory – Acidification in the Ocean Interior 
 
Advances in observations and modelling for ocean physics and biogeochemistry and established knowledge 
of ocean carbonate chemistry show with very high confidence that anthropogenic CO₂ taken up into the 
ocean surface layer is further spreading into the ocean interior through ventilation processes including 
vertical mixing, diffusion, subduction and meridional overturning circulations (Sallée et al., 2012; Bopp et 
al., 2015; Nakano et al., 2015; Iudicone et al., 2016; Toyama et al., 2017; Perez et al., 2018; Gruber et al., 
2019b) (Sections 2.3.3.5, 5.2.1.3 and 9.2.2.3) and is causing acidification in the ocean interior. The net 
change in oxygen consumptions by aerobic respiration of marine organisms further influences acidification 
by releasing CO₂ (Chen et al., 2017; Breitburg et al., 2018; Robinson, 2019) (Section 5.3.3.2).  
 
Basin-wide and global syntheses of ocean interior carbon observations for  the past decades show that the 
extent of acidification due to anthropogenic CO₂ invasion tends to diminish with depth (very high 
confidence) (Woosely et al., 2016;; Lauvset et al., 2020) (Carter et al., 2017a)(Figure 5.21; Section 
5.2.1.3.3). The regions of deep convection such as subpolar North Atlantic and Southern Ocean present the 
deepest acidification detections below 2000 m (medium confidence). Mid-latitudinal zones within the 
subtropical cells and tropical regions present a relatively deep and shallow detection, respectively. A pH 
decrease has also been observed on the Antarctic continental shelf (Hauck et al., 2010; Williams et al., 
2015). Acidification is also underway in the subsurface to intermediate layers of the Arctic Ocean due to the 
inflow of ventilated waters from the North Atlantic and the North Pacific (Qi et al., 2017; Ulfsbo et al., 
2018).  
 
<figref>5.21</figref>  
 
A significant increase in acidification resulting from net metabolic CO₂ release coupled with ocean 
circulation changes has been shown with high confidence in large swathes of intermediate waters both in the 
Pacific and Atlantic oceans (Byrne et al., 2010; Carter et al., 2017; Chu et al., 2016; Dore et al., 2009; Rios 
et a., 2015; Lauvset et al., 2020).  For example, ocean circulation contributes a pH change of –0.013 ± 0.013 
to the overall observed change of –0.029 ± 0.014 for 1993–2013 at depths around 1000 m at 30°S–40°S in 
the South Atlantic ocean (Ríos et al., 2015). Long-term repeated observations in the North Pacific show a 
decline in dissolved oxygen (–4.0 μmol kg−1 per decade at maximum) being sustained in the intermediate 
water since the 1980s (Takatani et al., 2012; Sasano et al., 2015), and thus the amplification of acidification 
associated with the weakening ventilation is thought to have been occurring persistently. In contrast, for the 
North Pacific subtropical mode water, large decadal variability in pH and aragonite saturation state with 
amplitudes of about 0.02 and about 0.1, respectively, are superimposed on secular declining trends due to 
anthropogenic CO₂ invasion (Oka et al., 2019).  This is associated with the variability in ventilation due to 
the approximately 50% variation in the formation volume of the mode water that is forced remotely by the 
Pacific decadal oscillation (Qiu et al., 2014; Oka et al., 2015). 
 
These trends of acidification in the ocean interior leads to high confidence in shoaling of the saturation 
horizons of calcium carbonate minerals where Ω = 1. In the Pacific Ocean where the aragonite saturation 
horizon is shallower (a few hundred meters to 1200 m; Figure 5.21c), the rate of its shoaling is on the order 
of 1–2 m yr<sup>–1</sup> (Feely et al., 2012; Ross et al., 2020). In contrast, shoaling rates of 4 m yr<sup>–1</sup> to 1710 m for 
1984–2008 and of 10–15 m yr<sup>–1</sup> to 2250 m for 1991–2016 have been observed in the Iceland sea and the 
Irminger sea, respectively (Olafsson et al., 2009; Perez et al., 2018).  
 
In summary, ocean acidification is spreading into the ocean interior. Its rates at depths are controlled by the 
ventilation of the ocean interior as well as anthropogenic CO₂ uptake at the surface, thereby diminishing with 
depth (very high confidence) (Figure 5.21). Variability in ocean circulation modulates the trend of ocean 
acidification at depths through the changes in ventilation and their impacts on metabolic CO₂ content, but 
there are large knowledge gaps of ventilation changes leading to low confidence in their impacts in many 
ocean regions (Sections 9.2.2.3 and 9.3.2; Section 5.3.3.2).  
 
 
### 5.3.3.2  Ocean Deoxygenation and its Implications for GHGs 

As summarised in SROCC (Section 5.2.2.4), there is a growing consensus that between 1970–2010 the open 
ocean has very likely lost 0.5–3.3% of its dissolved oxygen in the upper 1000 m depth (Helm et al., 2011; Ito 
et al., 2017; Schmidtko et al., 2017; Bindoff et al., 2019) (Section 2.3.3.6).  Regionally, the equatorial and 
North Pacific, the Southern Ocean and the South Atlantic have shown the greatest oxygen loss of up to 30 
mol m-2 per decade (Schmidtko et al., 2017). Warming – via solubility reduction and circulation changes –, 
mixing and respiration are considered the major drivers with 50% of the oxygen loss for the upper 1000 m of 
the global oceans attributable to the solubility reduction (Schmidtko et al., 2017). Climate variability also 
modifies the oxygen loss on interannual and decadal timescales especially for the tropical ocean OMZs 
(Deutsch et al., 2011, 2014; Llanillo et al., 2013) and the North Pacific subarctic zone (Whitney et al., 2007; 
Sasano et al., 2018; Cummins and Ross, 2020). However, quantifying the oxygen decline and variability and 
attributing them to processes in different regions remains challenging (Oschlies et al., 2018; Levin, 2018). 
ESMs in coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 (CMIP5) and CMIP6 corroborate the decline in 
ocean oxygen, and project a continuing and accelerating decline with a strong impact of natural climate 
variability under high emission scenarios (Bopp et al., 2013; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020; Long et al., 2016). 
However, CMIP5 models did not reproduce observed patterns for oxygen changes in the tropical thermocline 
and generally simulated only about half the oxygen loss inferred from observations (Oschlies et al., 2018). 
CMIP6 models have more realistic simulated mean state of ocean biogeochemistry than CMIP5 models due 
to improved ocean physical processes and better representation of biogeochemical processes (Séférian et al., 
2020). They also exhibit enhanced ocean warming as a result of an increase in the equilibrium climate 
sensitivity (ECS) of CMIP6 relative to CMIP5 models, which contributes to increased stratification and 
reduced subsurface ventilation (4.3.1, 4.3.4, 5.3.3.2, 7.4.2, 7.5.6, 9.2.1, TS2.4).  Consequently, CMIP6 model 
ensembles not only reproduce the ocean deoxygenation trend of −0.30 to −1.52 mmol m−3 per decade 
between 1970–2010 reported in SROCC (Section 5.2.2.4) with a very likely range, but also project 32–71 % 
greater subsurface (100–600 m) oxygen decline relative to their RCP analogues in CMIP5, reaching to the 
likely range of decline of 6.4 ± 2.9 mmol m-3 under SSP1–2.6 and 13.3 ± 5.3 mmol m-3 under SSP5–8.5, 
from 1870–1899 to 2080–2099. However, they also exhibit enhanced surface ocean warming as a result of 
an increased climate sensitivity (ECS), which contributes to greater reduction in subsurface ventilation. 
Consequently, CMIP6 model ensembles now reproduce the recent observed historical ocean deoxygenation 
trend of −0.30 to −1.52 mmol m-3 per decade between 1970–2010 reported in SROCC (Section 5.2.2.4) 
within 90% confidence range, but project 32–71 % greater subsurface (100–600m) oxygen decline relative to 
their RCP analogues in CMIP5, reaching to the likely range of decline of 6.4 ± 2.9 mmol m-3 under SSP1–2.6 
and 13.3 ± 5.3 mmol m-3 under SSP5–8.5, from 1870–1899 to 2080–2099 due to increased warming 
(Kwiatkowski et al., 2020).  It is concluded that the oxygen content of subsurface ocean is projected to 
transition to historically unprecedented condition with decline over the 21st century (medium confidence).  
 
In oxygen-depleted waters, microbial processes (denitrification and anammox, i.e. anaerobic ammonium 
oxidation) (Kuypers et al., 2005; Codispoti, 2007; Gruber and Galloway, 2008) remove fixed nitrogen, and 
thus when upwelled waters reach the photic zone, primary production becomes nitrogen-limited (Tyrrell and 
Lucas, 2002). However, in other oceanic regions, increased water-column stratification due to warming may 
reduce the amount of N₂O reaching the surface and thereby decrease N₂O flux to the atmosphere. Landolfi et 
al. (2017) suggest that by 2100, under the RCP8.5 scenario, total N₂O production in the ocean may decline 
by 5% and N₂O emissions be reduced by 24% relative to the pre-industrial era due to decreased organic 
matter export and anthropogenic driven changes in ocean circulation and atmospheric N₂O concentrations. 
Projected oxygen loss in the ocean is thought to result in an ocean-climate feedback through changes in the 
natural emission of greenhouse gases (low confidence). 
 
The areas with relatively rapid oxygen decrease include OMZs in the tropical oceans, where oxygen content 
has been decreasing at a rate of 0.9 to 3.4 µmol kg-1 per decade in the thermocline for the past five decades 
(Stramma et al., 2008). Low oxygen, low pH and shallow aragonite saturation horizons in the OMZs of the 
eastern boundary upwelling regions co-occur, affecting ecosystem structure (Chavez et al., 2008) and 
function in the water column, including the presently unbalanced nitrogen cycle (Paulmier and Ruiz-Pino, 
2009). The coupling between upwelling, productivity, and oxygen depletion feeds back to biological 
productivity and the role of these regions as sinks or sources of climate active gases. When OMZ waters 
upwell and impinge on the euphotic zone, they release significant quantities of greenhouse gases, including 
N₂O (0.81–1.35 TgN yr<sup>–1</sup>), CH₄ (0.27–0.38 TgCH₄ yr<sup>–1</sup>), and CO₂ (yet to be quantified) to the atmosphere, 
exacerbating global warming (Paulmier et al., 2008; Naqvi et al., 2010; Kock et al., 2012; Arévalo-Martínez 
et al., 2015; Babbin et al., 2015a; Farías et al., 2015). Modelling projections suggest a global decrease of 4 to 
12% in oceanic N₂O emissions (from 3.71–4.03 TgN yr<sup>–1</sup> to 3.54–3.56 TgN yr<sup>–1</sup>) from 2005 to 2100 under 
RCP8.5, despite a tendency to increased N₂O production in the OMZs, associated primarily with 
denitrification (Martinez-Rey et al., 2015). It is difficult to single out the contribution of nitrification and 
denitrification which can occur simultaneously. A rigorous separation of these two processes would require 
more mechanistic parameterisations that have been hindered by the still large conceptual and parametric 
uncertainties (Babbin et al., 2015; Trimmer et al., 2016; Landolfi et al., 2017). Furthermore, the correlation 
between N₂O and oxygen varies with microorganisms present, nutrient concentrations, and other 
environmental variables (Voss et al., 2013). 
 
In summary, total oceanic N₂O emissions were projected to decline by 4–12% from 2005–2100 (Martinez-
Rey et al., 2015) and by 24% from the pre-industrial era to 2100 (Landolfi et al., 2017) under RCP8.5. 
However, there is low confidence in the reduction in N₂O emission to the atmosphere, because of large 
conceptual and parametric uncertainties, a limited number of modelling studies that explored this process, 
and greater oxygen losses simulated in CMIP6 models than in CMIP5 models (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). 
 
 
## 5.3.4  Future Projections for Ocean Acidification 
 
### 5.3.4.1  Future Projections with Earth System Models 

Projections with CMIP5 ESMs, reported in AR5 (Section 6.4.4) and SROCC (Section 5.2.2.3; (IPCC, 
2019b)), showed changes in global mean surface ocean pH from 1870–1899 to 2080–2099 of -0.14 ± 0.001 
(inter-model standard deviation) under RCP2.6 and –0.38 ±0.005 under RCP8.5 with pronounced regional 
variability (Bopp et al., 2013; Hurd et al., 2018).  They also projected faster pH declines in mode waters 
below seasonal mixed layers (Resplandy et al., 2013; Watanabe and Kawamiya, 2017) as has been observed 
in the Atlantic (Salt et al., 2015) and in the Pacific (Carter et al., 2019), because of the net CO₂ release by 
respiration and lowering CO₂ buffering capacity of seawater. In these CO₂ concentration-driven simulations, 
the level of acidification in the surface ocean is primarily determined by atmospheric CO₂ concentration and 
regional seawater carbonate chemistry, thereby providing consistent projections across models. New 
projections with CMIP6 ESMs show greater surface pH decline of -0.16 ± 0.002 under the SSP1–2.6 and –
0.44 ± 0.005 under SSP5–8.5 from 1870–1899 to 2080–2099 (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020) (Section 4.3.2.5; 
Cross-Chapter Box 5.3).  The greater pH declines in CMIP6 are primarily a consequence of higher 
atmospheric CO₂ concentrations in SSPs than their CMIP5-RCP analogues (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020).  
Ocean acidification is also projected to occur with high confidence in the abyssal bottom waters in regions 
such as the northern North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean (Sulpis et al., 2019), with the rates of global 
mean pH decline of –0.018 ±0.001 under SSP1–2.6 and –0.030 ± 0.002 under SSP5–8.5 from 1870–1899 to 
2080–2099 in CMIP6 (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). 
 
In surface ocean, changes in the amplitude of seasonal variations in pH are also projected to occur with high 
confidence. ESMs in CMIP6 s show +73 ± 12% increase in the amplitude of seasonal variation in hydrogen 
ion concentration ([H+]) but 10 ±5% decrease in the seasonal variation in pH (= -log [H+]) from 1995–2014 
to 2080–2099 under SSP5–8.5. The simultaneous amplification of [H+] and attenuation of pH seasonal 
cycles is counterintuitive but is the consequence of greater increase in the annual mean [H+] due to 
anthropogenic CO₂ invasion than the corresponding increase in its seasonal amplitude. These changes are 
consistent with the amplification/attenuation of the seasonal variation of +81 ±16% for [H+] and –16 ± 7% 
for pH from 1990–1999 to 2090–2099 under RCP8.5 in CMIP5 (Kwiatkowski and Orr, 2018). 
 
The signal of ocean acidification in surface ocean is large and is projected to emerge beyond the range of 
natural variability within the time scale of a decade in all ocean basins (Schlunegger et al., 2019). There is 
high agreement among modelling studies that the largest pH decline and large-scale undersaturation of 
aragonite in surface seawater start to occur first in polar oceans (Orr et al., 2005; Steinacher et al., 2009; 
Hurd et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2019). Under SSP5–8.5, the largest surface pH decline, exceeding 0.45 
between 1995–2014 and 2080–2099, occurs in the Arctic Ocean (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). The freshwater 
input from sea-ice melt is an additional factor leading to a faster decline of aragonite saturation level than 
expected from the anthropogenic CO₂ uptake (Yamamoto et al., 2012). The increase in riverine and glacial 
discharges that provide terrigenous carbon, nutrients and alkalinity as well as freshwater are the other factors 
modifying the rate of acidification in the Arctic Ocean. However, their impacts have been projected in a 
limited number of studies with extensive knowledge gaps and model simplifications leading to low 
confidence in their impacts (Terhaar et al., 2019; Hopwood et al., 2020). In the Southern Ocean, the 
aragonite undersaturation starts in 2030 in RCP8.5, and the area that experiences aragonite undersaturation 
for at least one month per year by 2100 is projected to be more than 95%. Under RCP2.6, short periods (< 1 
month) of aragonite undersaturation are expected to be found in less than 2% to the area during this century 
(Sasse et al., 2015; Hauri et al., 2016; Negrete-García et al., 2019). These long term projections are modified 
at interannual timescales by large-scale climate modes (Ríos et al., 2015) such as the El Niño southern 
oscillation and the southern annular mode (Conrad and Lovenduski, 2015). In other regions, acidification 
trends are influenced by a range of processes such as changes in ocean circulation, temperature, salinity, 
carbon cycling, and the structure of the marine ecosystem. As, at present, models do not resolve fine-scale 
variability of these processes, current projections do not fully capture the changes that the marine 
environment will experience in the future (Takeshita et al., 2015; Turi et al., 2016). 
 
Overall, with the rise of atmospheric CO₂, the physics of CO₂ transfer across the air-sea interface, the 
carbonate chemistry in seawater, the trends of ocean acidification being observed in the past decades 
(Section 5.3.3.2) and modelling studies described in this section, it is virtually certain that ocean 
acidification will continue to grow. However, the magnitude and sign of many of ocean carbon-climate 
feedbacks are still poorly constrained (Matear and Lenton, 2014; Matear and Lenton, 2018), leading to low 
confidence in their significant and long-lasting impacts on ocean acidification. 
 
 
### 5.3.4.2  Reversal of Ocean Acidification by Carbon Dioxide Removal 
 
Reversing the increase in atmospheric CO₂ concentrations through negative emissions (Section 5.6) will 
reverse ocean acidification at the sea surface but will not result in rapid amelioration of ocean acidification in 
the deeper ocean (Section 5.3.3.2). The ocean’s uptake of atmospheric CO₂ will start to decrease as 
atmospheric CO₂ decreases (Mathesius et al., 2015; Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015) (Sections 5.4.5, 5.4.10; 
5.6.2.1) However, because of the long timescales of the ocean turnover that transfers CO₂ from the upper to 
the deep ocean, excess carbon will continue to accumulate in the deep ocean even after a decrease in 
atmospheric CO₂ (Cao et al., 2014; Mathesius et al., 2015; Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; Li et al., 2020). 
There is thus high confidence that CO₂ emissions leave a long-term legacy in ocean acidification, and are 
therefore irreversible at multi-human generational scales, even with aggressive atmospheric CO₂ removal. 
 
 
## 5.3.5  Coastal Ocean Acidification and Deoxygenation 
 
The coastal ocean, from the shore line to the isobath of 200 m, is highly heterogeneous due to the complex 
interplay between physical, biogeochemical and anthropogenic factors (Gattuso et al., 1998; Chen and 
Borges, 2009; Dürr et al., 2011; Laruelle et al., 2014; McCormack et al., 2016). These areas, according to 
SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019) are, with high confidence, already affected by ocean acidification and 
deoxygenation. This section assesses the drivers and spatial variability of acidification and deoxygenation 
based on new observations and data products. 
 
 
### 5.3.5.1  Drivers 
 
Observations and data products including models (Astor et al., 2013; Bakker et al., 2016; Kosugi et al., 2016; 
Vargas et al., 2016; Laruelle et al., 2017, 2018; Orselli et al., 2018; Roobaert et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2020; 
Sun et al., 2020a) confirm the strong spatial and temporal variability in the coastal ocean surface carbonate 
chemistry and sea-air CO₂ fluxes (high agreement, robust evidence). The anthropogenic CO₂-induced 
acidification is either mitigated or enhanced through biological processes; primary production removes 
dissolved CO₂ from the surface, and respiration adds CO₂ and consumes oxygen in the subsurface layers. 
The relative intensity of these processes is controlled by natural or anthropogenic eutrophication. Other 
drivers of variability include biological community composition, freshwater input from rivers or ice-melting,  
sea-ice cover and calcium carbonate precipitation/dissolution dynamics, coastal upwelling and regional 
circulation, and seasonal surface cooling (Fransson et al., 2015, 2017; Feely et al., 2018; Roobaert et al., 
2019; Cai et al., 2020; Hauri et al., 2020; Monteiro et al., 2020b; Sun et al., 2020a). Near-shore surface 
waters are often supersaturated with CO₂, regardless of the latitude, especially in highly populated areas 
receiving substantial amounts of domestic and industrial sewage (Chen and Borges, 2009)⁠. Nevertheless, 
thermal or haline stratified eutrophic coastal areas may act as net atmospheric CO₂ sinks (Chou et al., 2013; 
Cotovicz Jr. et al., 2015a). Continental shelves, excluding near-shore areas, act as CO₂ sinks at a rate of 0.2 ± 
0.02 PgC yr<sup>–1</sup> (Laruelle et al., 2014; Roobaert et al., 2019), considering ice-free areas only. Under increasing 
atmospheric CO₂ and eutrophication, such ecosystems would be more vulnerable to ecological and seawater 
chemistry changes, impacting local economy.  
 
Since AR5, (Ciais et al., 2013) and in agreement with SROCC (IPCC, 2019b), there is now high agreement 
(robust evidence) that coastal ocean acidification, whether induced only by increasing atmospheric CO₂ or 
exacerbated by eutrophication or upwelling, has negative effects on specific groups of marine organisms 
such as reef-building corals, crabs, pteropods, and sessile fauna (Dupont et al., 2010; Bindoff et al., 2019; 
Bednaršek et al., 2020; Osborne et al., 2020), WGII AR6 Chapter 3)⁠, especially when combined with 
stressors such as temperature and deoxygenation, and potentially increased bioavailability of toxic elements 
such as arsenic and copper (Millero et al., 2009; Boyd et al., 2015; Breitburg et al., 2018). 
 
Since SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019), there is further evidence that anthropogenic eutrophication via 
continental runoff and atmospheric nutrient deposition, and ocean warming are very likely the main drivers 
of deoxygenation in coastal areas (Levin and Breitburg, 2015; Levin et al., 2015; Royer et al., 2016; 
Breitburg et al., 2018; Cocquempot et al., 2019; Fagundes et al., 2020; Limburg et al., 2020a). Increasing 
intensity and frequency of wind-driven upwelling is responsible for longer and more intense coastal hypoxia, 
fuelled by organic matter degradation from primary production (medium to high agreement, medium 
evidence) (Rabalais et al., 2010; Bakun et al., 2015; Varela et al., 2015; Fennel and Testa, 2019; Limburg et 
al., 2020a). Locally, submarine groundwater discharge may enhance the eutrophication state (low agreement, 
limited evidence, (Luijendijk et al., 2020)). Since AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013) and SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019) 
new observations and model studies confirm the trends in increasing coastal hypoxia caused by 
eutrophication, ocean warming and changes in circulation (Claret et al., 2018; Dussin et al., 2019; Limburg 
et al., 2020a), as well as the ubiquitous impacts on marine organisms and fisheries (Carstensen and Conley, 
2019; Fennel and Testa, 2019; Osma et al., 2020); WGII Chapter 3). Following open ocean deoxygenation 
trends, since the 1950s more than 700 coastal regions are being reported as hypoxic (dissolved oxygen 
concentration <2 mg O2 L-1) (Limburg et al., 2020a). Additionally, deoxygenation or increasing severe 
hypoxic periods in coastal areas may enhance the sea-to-air fluxes of N₂O and CH₄ especially through 
microbial-mediated processes in the water column-sediment interface (medium agreement) (Middelburg and 
Levin, 2009; Naqvi et al., 2010b; Farías et al., 2015; Limburg et al., 2020a).  
 
 
### 5.3.5.2  Spatial Characteristics 
 
There is high agreement (robust evidence) that heterogeneity implies different responses of coastal regions to 
increasing atmospheric CO₂, decreasing seawater pH and calcium carbonate saturation state, and 
deoxygenation (Duarte et al., 2013; Regnier et al., 2013b; Breitburg et al., 2018; Laruelle et al., 2018; 
Carstensen and Duarte, 2019).  
 
There is high agreement that long time series of observations utilising standard methods are needed to 
distinguish the climate change signal in seawater carbonate chemistry from the natural variability of coastal 
sites (Duarte et al., 2013; Salisbury and Jönsson, 2018; IOC, 2019; Sutton et al., 2019; Tilbrook et al., 2019; 
Turk et al., 2019). Despite increasing availability of data and sea-air CO₂ flux budgets for the coastal ocean 
(Sections 5.3.5.1, 5.2.3.1), additional long-term observations are required to constrain the global time of 
emergence of coastal acidification. There is high agreement (medium evidence) that, for the coastal 
subtropical to temperate northeast Pacific and northwest Atlantic, the mean time of emergence for 
acidification is above two decades (Sutton et al., 2019; Turk et al., 2019).  
 
Observations and models predict for the northeast Pacific coastal upwelling area an expansion and 
intensification of low-pH deep water intrusions (high agreement, robust evidence) (Hauri et al., 2013; Feely 
et al., 2016b; Cai et al., 2020). There, areas such as the California Current System are naturally exposed to 
intrusions of low‐pH, high pCO₂sea deep waters from remineralisation processes and anthropogenic CO₂ 
intrusion (Feely et al., 2008, 2010, 2018; Chan et al., 2019; Lilly et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2020).The eastern 
Pacific coastal upwelling displays seasonality in subsurface aragonite undersaturation as a consequence of 
the interplay between anthropogenic CO₂, respiration and intrusion of upwelling waters (Feely et al., 2008, 
2010, 2016, 2018; Hauri et al., 2013; Vargas et al., 2016; Chan et al., 2019; Lilly et al., 2019). The coastal 
southeast Pacific, upwelling combined with low-pH, low-alkalinity, organic matter-rich river inputs display 
extreme temporal variability in surface seawater pCO₂ and low aragonite saturation (Vargas et al., 2016; 
Osma et al., 2020).  
 
Temperate, non-upwelling coastal areas along the northwest Atlantic display a trend of decreasing seawater 
pH, mainly attributed to the combined effects of decreasing seawater buffering capacity and eutrophication 
(high agreement, robust evidence). Observations show an increasing north to south gradient of aragonite 
saturation state (Sutton et al., 2016; Fennel et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2020). Low alkalinity and total inorganic 
carbon concentration, combined with an ocean signal of acidification, diminishes the buffering capacity 
along the decreasing salinity gradient from the ocean to the coast. Models suggest that in this area the 
aragonite saturation is seasonally controlled by nutrient availability and primary production, supporting that 
eutrophication is the main driver for exacerbating acidification.(Cai et al., 2017, 2020). The coastal Gulf of 
Mexico is facing a parallel increase in bottom water acidification and deoxygenation off the Mississippi 
Delta driven by eutrophication (Cai et al., 2011; Laurent et al., 2017; Fennel et al., 2019). 
 
Many coastal tropical are under heavy anthropogenic eutrophication induced by the effluents from large 
cities or receive large riverine inputs of freshwater, nutrients, and organic matter (such as Amazon, 
Mississippi, Orinoco, Congo, Mekong, or Changjiang rivers). Under strong eutrophication, often sub-surface 
and bottom waters present pH values lower than average surface open ocean (about 8.0) because increased 
respiration decreases pH (high agreement, robust evidence), despite a net atmospheric CO₂ sink in shallow 
and vertically stratified coastal areas (Koné et al., 2009; Wallace et al., 2014; Cotovicz Jr. et al., 2015b; 
Cotovicz et al., 2018; Fennel and Testa, 2019; Lowe et al., 2019) (Section 5.3.5.1).    
 
There is medium evidence from observations and models that the coastal northwestern Antarctic Peninsula 
(Southern Ocean) will experience calcium carbonate undersaturation by 2060, considering that 
anthropogenic emissions reach an atmospheric CO₂ concentration of about 500 pm at that date (Lencina-
Avila et al., 2018; Monteiro et al., 2020a). The synergies among warming, meltwater, sea-air CO₂ 
equilibrium and circulation may, to some extent, offset the coastal ocean acidification trends in Antarctica 
(Henley et al., 2020). In the coastal western Arctic Ocean, there is increasing robust evidence that ocean 
acidification is driven by sea-air CO₂ fluxes and sea-ice melt and increasing intrusions since the 1990s of 
low-alkalinity Pacific water, lowering aragonite saturation state (Qi et al., 2017, 2020; Cross et al., 2018). 
The Bering Sea (northeastern Pacific) shows decreasing trends in calcium carbonate saturation, associated to 
the increasing atmospheric CO₂ uptake combined with riverine freshwater and carbon inputs (high 
agreement, robust evidence) (Pilcher et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2020a). 
 
The spatial distribution of hypoxic areas is highly heterogeneous in the coastal ocean, and there is high 
agreement, robust evidence that more severe hypoxia or anoxia is often associated to highly populated 
coastal areas, or local circulation and upwelling, and seasonal stratification lead to an accumulation of 
organic matter in subsurface waters (Ciais et al., 2013; Rabalais et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016b; Breitburg et al., 
2018; Bindoff et al., 2019) (SROCC Chapter 5; IPCC, (2019b)). The causes and trends of coastal 
deoxygenation can only be assessed by making available long-term time series combined to regional 
modelling (Fennel and Testa, 2019), as in the California current system (Wang et al., 2017), the East China 
Sea (Chen et al., 2007; Qian et al., 2017), the Namibian or along the northwestern Atlantic shelves (Claret et 
al., 2018). Other coastal upwelling sites such as the Arabian Sea display seasonal hypoxia but no worsening 
trends (Gupta et al., 2016). 
 
The Baltic Sea is the largest semi-enclosed sea where hypoxia is reported to have happened before the 1950s 
(Carstensen et al., 2014; Rabalais et al., 2014; Łukawska-Matuszewska et al., 2019). The frequency and 
volume of seawater inflow from the North Sea decreased after 1950, leading to an expansion of hypoxic 
areas from 40,000 to 60,000 km² in combination with increasing eutrophication (Carstensen et al., 2014). 
From the available observations, there is robust evidence that many areas in the Baltic Sea are experiencing 
deoxygenation despite efforts to reduce nutrient loads (Lennartz et al., 2014; Jokinen et al., 2018).  
 
There is medium agreement (medium evidence) that just by reducing anthropogenic nutrient inputs may lead 
to less severe coastal hypoxic conditions, as observed in the coastal north-western Adriatic Sea (Djakovac et 
al. (2015). However, low-oxygen sediments may remain a long-term source of phosphorus and ammonium 
to the water column, fuelling primary production (Jokinen et al., 2018; Fennel and Testa, 2019; Limburg et 
al., 2020b). 
 
 
# 5.4  Biogeochemical Feedbacks on Climate Change 
 
This section covers biogeochemical feedbacks on climate change, which represent one of the largest sources 
of uncertainty in climate change projections. The relevant processes are discussed (Sections 5.4.1 to 5.4.4), 
prior to discussing the simulation and projection of the carbon cycle in Earth system models (Section 5.4.5), 
emergent constraints on future projections (Section 5.4.7), non-CO₂ feedbacks (Section 5.4.7), and possible 
biogeochemical abrupt changes (Section 5.4.8). 
 
 
## 5.4.1  Direct CO₂ Effect on Land Carbon Uptake  
 
AR5 (WGI, Box 6.3) and SRCCL (IPCC, 2019a) concluded with high confidence that rising atmospheric 
CO₂ increases leaf-level photosynthesis. This effect is represented in all ESMs. New studies since AR5 add 
evidence that the leaf-level CO₂ fertilisation is modulated by acclimation of photosynthesis to long-term CO₂ 
exposure, growth temperature, seasonal drought, and nutrient availability, but these effects are not yet 
routinely represented in ESMs (Smith and Dukes, 2013; Baig et al., 2015; Kelly et al., 2016; Drake et al., 
2017; Jiang et al., 2020a). Cross-Chapter Box 5.1 assesses multiple lines of evidence, which suggest that the 
ratio of plant CO₂ uptake to water loss (plant water-use efficiency; WUE) increases in near proportionality to 
atmospheric CO₂. Despite advances in the regional coverage of field experiments, observations of the 
consequences of CO₂ fertilisation at ecosystem level are still scarce, in particular from outside the temperate 
zone (Song et al., 2019a). New syntheses since AR5 corroborate that the effect of elevated CO₂ on plant 
growth and ecosystem carbon storage is generally positive (high confidence), but is modulated by 
temperature, water and nutrient availability (Reich et al., 2014; Obermeier et al., 2017; Peñuelas et al., 2017; 
Hovenden et al., 2019; Song et al., 2019a). Plant carbon allocation, changes in plant community 
composition, disturbance, and natural plant mortality are important processes affecting the magnitude of the 
response, but are currently poorly represented in models (De Kauwe et al., 2014; Friend et al., 2014; Reich et 
al., 2018; Walker et al., 2019a; Yu et al., 2019), and thus contribute strongly to uncertainty in ESM 
projections (Arora et al., 2020).  
 
Field studies with elevated CO₂ have demonstrated that the initial stimulation of above-ground growth may 
decline if insufficient nutrients such as nitrogen or phosphorus are available (Finzi et al., 2007; Norby et al., 
2010; Hungate et al., 2013; Reich and Hobbie, 2013; Talhelm et al., 2014; Terrer et al., 2018). Model-data 
syntheses have demonstrated that the ability to capture the observed long-term effect of elevated CO₂ 
depends on the ability of models to predict the effect of vegetation on soil biogeochemistry (Zaehle et al., 
2014; Koven et al., 2015; Medlyn et al., 2015; Walker et al., 2015). Meta-analyses of CO₂ manipulation 
experiments point to increased soil microbial activity and accelerated turnover of soil organic matter (van 
Groenigen et al., 2017) as a result of increased below-ground carbon allocation by plants (Song et al., 
2019b), and increased root exudation or mycorrhizal activity due to enhanced plant nutrient requirements 
under elevated CO₂ (Drake et al., 2011; Terrer et al., 2016; Meier et al., 2017). These effects are not 
considered in most ESMs. One global model that attempts to represent these processes suggests that elevated 
CO₂ related carbon accumulation is reduced in soils but increased in vegetation relative to more conventional 
models (Sulman et al., 2019).  
 
Our understanding of the effects of phosphorus limitation is less developed than for nitrogen, but a growing 
body of literature suggests it is as important, particularly in regions with highly weathered soils (Wang et al., 
2018; Terrer et al., 2019; Du et al., 2020). CO₂ experiments collectively show that soil phosphorus is an 
important constraint on the CO₂ fertilisation effect on plant biomass (Terrer et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2020a). 
Indeed, a free-air CO₂ enrichment experiment in a phosphorus-limited mature forest ecosystem did not find 
an increase in biomass production despite increases in photosynthesis after four years of CO₂ exposure 
(Jiang et al., 2020b). The lack of free-air CO₂ enrichment experiments in phosphorus-limited tropical forests 
limits our understanding on the role of phosphorus availability in constraining the CO₂ fertilisation effect 
globally (Norby et al., 2016; Fleischer et al., 2019). Models accounting for the effects of phosphorus 
availability, in addition to nitrogen, generally show an even stronger reduction of the response of ecosystem 
carbon storage to elevated CO₂ (Goll et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2019b). Insufficient data 
and uncertainties in the process formulation cause large uncertainty in the magnitude of this effect (Medlyn 
et al., 2016; Fleischer et al., 2019). 
 
Consistent with AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.2), the CO₂ fertilisation effect is the dominant cause for the projected 
increase in land carbon uptake between 1860 and 2100 in ESMs (Figures 5.26, 5.27; Table 5.5; Arora et al., 
2020). In the CMIP6 ensemble, the increase of land carbon storage due to CO₂ fertilisation is a global 
phenomenon but is strongest in the tropics (Figure 5.26). The resulting increase of productivity is a key 
driver of increases in vegetation and soil carbon storage. However, consistent with earlier findings (Todd-
Brown et al., 2013; Friend et al., 2014; Hajima et al., 2014), processes affecting vegetation carbon-use 
efficiency and turnover such as allocation changes, mortality, and vegetation structural changes, as well as 
the pre-industrial soil carbon turnover time, also play an important role (Arora et al., 2020).  
 
As a major advance since AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.2), 6 out of 11 models in the C4MIP-CMIP6 ensemble 
account for nitrogen cycle dynamics over land (Table 5.4). On average, these models exhibit a 25–30% 
lower CO₂ fertilisation effect on land carbon storage, compared to models that do not (Figures 5.29, Table 
5.5). The only model in the C4MIP-CMIP6 ensemble that explicitly represents the effect of P availability on 
plant growth suggests the lowest C storage response to increasing CO₂ (Arora et al., 2020). The lower CO₂ 
effect due to decreased nutrient availability is generally consistent with analyses of the implicit nutrient 
limitation in CMIP5 simulations (Wieder et al., 2015; Zaehle et al., 2015) and independent assessments by 
stand-alone land models (Zaehle et al., 2010; Wårlind et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014; Goll et al., 2017; 
Meyerholt et al., 2020a). The simulated effects are generally consistent with expectations based on 
independent observations (Walker et al., 2020). However, the magnitude of nutrient feedbacks in these 
models is poorly constrained by observations, owing to the limited geographic distribution of available 
observations and the uncertain scaling of results obtained from manipulation experiments to transient system 
dynamics (Song et al., 2019a; Wieder et al., 2019; Meyerholt et al., 2020a). 
 
Our understanding of the various biological processes, which affect the strength of the CO₂ fertilisation 
effect on photosynthesis and its impact on carbon storage in vegetation and soils, in particular regarding the 
limitations imposed by nitrogen and phosphorus availability, has developed since AR5 (WGI, Box 6.2). 
Based on consistent behaviour across all CMIP6 ESMs, there is high confidence that CO₂ fertilisation of 
photosynthesis acts as an important negative feedback on anthropogenic climate change, by reducing the rate 
at which CO₂ accumulates in the atmosphere. Since AR5 (WGI, Box 6.2), an increasing number of CMIP6 
ESMs account for nutrient cycles and the consistent results found in their model projections suggests with 
high confidence that limited nutrient availability will limit the CO₂ fertilisation effect (Arora et al., 2020). 
The magnitude of both the direct CO₂ effect on land carbon uptake, and its limitation by nutrients, remains 
uncertain (low confidence). 
 
 
## 5.4.2  Direct CO₂ Effects on Projected Ocean Carbon Uptake 
 
In AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.2) there was high agreement that CMIP5 ESMs project continued ocean CO₂ 
uptake through to 2100, with higher uptake corresponding to higher concentration or emission pathways. 
There has been no significant change in the magnitude of the sensitivity of ocean carbon uptake to increasing 
atmospheric CO₂, or in the inter-model spread, between the CMIP5 and CMIP6 era (Arora et al., 2020). The 
analysis from both emissions and concentration driven CMIP5 models projections show that the ocean sink 
stops growing beyond 2050 across all emission scenarios (Section 5.4.5.3). CMIP6 models also show a 
similar time-evolution of global ocean CO₂ uptake to CMIP5 models over the 21st century (Figure 5.25) 
with decreasing net ocean CO₂ uptake ratio to anthropogenic CO₂ emissions under SSP5–8.5. 
 
The projected weakening of ocean carbon uptake is driven by a combination of decreasing carbonate 
buffering capacity and warming which are positive feedbacks under weak to no mitigation scenarios (SSP4 
and 5). In high mitigation scenarios (SSP1–2.6), weakening ocean carbon uptake is driven by decreasing 
emissions (Cross-Chapter Box 5.3). The detailed understanding of carbonate chemistry in seawater that has 
accumulated over more than half a century (e.g. Egleston et al., 2010; Revelle & Suess, 1957), provides high 
confidence that the excess CO₂ dissolved in seawater leads to a nonlinear reduction of the CO₂ buffering 
capacity, that is smaller dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) increase with respect to pCO₂ increase along with 
the increase in cumulative ocean CO₂ uptake. Recent studies (Katavouta et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2019; 
Arora et al., 2020; Rodgers et al., 2020) suggest with medium confidence that the decrease in the ocean CO₂ 
uptake ratio to anthropogenic CO₂ emission under low to no mitigation scenarios over the 21st century is 
predominantly attributable to the ocean carbon-concentration feedback through the reduction of the seawater 
CO₂ buffering capacity but with contributions from physical drivers such as warming and wind stress 
(medium confidence) and biological drivers (low confidence) (Sections 5.2.1.3.3, 5.4.4).  
 
Projected increases in ocean DIC due to anthropogenic CO₂ uptake amplify the sensitivity of carbonate 
system variables to perturbations of DIC in the surface ocean, for example via the amplitude of the seasonal 
cycle of pCO₂, which impact the mean annual air-sea fluxes (Fassbender et al., 2018; Hauck et al., 2015; 
Landschützer et al., 2018; SROCC Section 5.2.2.3). A larger amplification of the surface ocean pCO₂ 
seasonality occurs in the subtropics where pCO₂ seasonality is dominated by temperature seasonality, with 
 between surface water and the overlying atmosphere reaching 
the summer increase in the difference in pCO₂
3μatm per decade between 1990 and 2030 under RCP8.5 (Schlunegger et al., 2019; Rodgers et al., 2020). In 
contrast, the impact of biological production on the seasonal cycle of pCO₂ in summer in the Southern Ocean 
strengthens the drawdown of CO₂ (Hauck et al., 2015). 
 
Overall, there is medium confidence on three outcomes in the ocean from projected CO₂ uptake under 
medium to high CO₂ concentration scenarios: (i) a strengthening positive feedback, which impacts on the 
airborne fraction via the reduction of the ocean CO₂ buffering capacity due to cumulative ocean CO₂ uptake, 
which reduces the net ocean CO₂ uptake ratio to anthropogenic CO₂ emission (Katavouta et al., 2018; Arora 
et al., 2020; Rodgers et al., 2020); (ii) an amplification of the seasonal cycle of CO₂ variables, which impact 
both the ocean sink and ocean acidification (Hauck et al., 2015); (iii) a decrease in the aragonite and calcite 
saturation levels in the ocean which negatively impacts the calcification rates of marine organisms (high 
confidence) and which forms a negative feedback on the uptake of CO₂ (McNeil and Sasse, 2016) (Cross-
Chapter Box 5.3). 
 
 
## 5.4.3  Climate Effect on Land Carbon Uptake 
 
AR5 assessed with medium confidence, that future climate change will decrease land carbon uptake relative 
to the case with constant climate, but with a poorly-constrained magnitude (WGI, Chapter 6, Executive 
Summary). Ongoing uncertainty in the magnitude and geographic pattern of the feedbacks (Section 5.4.5), 
continues to support a medium confidence assessment that future climate change will decrease land carbon 
uptake relative to the case with constant climate.  
 
 
### 5.4.3.1  Plant Physiology 
 
Plant productivity is highly dependent on local climate. In cold environments, warming has generally led to 
an earlier onset of the growing season, and with it an increase in early-season vegetation productivity (e.g. 
Forkel et al., 2016). However, this trend is affected by adverse effects of climate variability, and other 
emerging limitations on vegetation production by water, energy and nutrients, which may gradually reduce 
the effects of warming (Piao et al., 2017; Buermann et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019). At centennial timescales, 
boreal forest expansion may act as a climate-driven carbon sink (Pugh et al., 2018). 
 
In tropical and temperate environments, temperature simultaneously affects the metabolic rates of 
photosynthetic processes within leaf tissues as well as the vapor pressure deficit that drives transpiration, its 
control by leaf stomata, and the resulting soil and plant tissue water content. Thus the direct effect of 
warming on photosynthesis can be positive, negative, or invariant depending on environmental context (Lin 
et al., 2012; Yamori et al., 2014; Smith and Dukes, 2017; Grossiord et al., 2020). Observations and models 
suggest that the vapour pressure deficit effects are stronger than direct temperature effects on enzyme 
activities (Smith et al., 2020), and that acclimation of photosynthetic optimal temperature may mitigate 
productivity losses of tropical forests under climate change (Kattge and Knorr, 2007; Tan et al., 2017; 
Kumarathunge et al., 2019). Some models have begun to include these acclimation responses, both in 
photosynthesis and autotrophic respiration (Lombardozzi et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2015; Huntingford et al., 
2017; Mercado et al., 2018).  
 
 
### 5.4.3.2  Fire and Other Disturbances 
 
SRCCL assessed that climate change is playing an increasing role in determining wildfire regimes alongside 
human activity (medium confidence), with future climate variability expected to enhance the recurrence and 
severity of wildfires in many biomes, such as tropical rainforests (high confidence). Projections of increased 
fire weather in a warmer climate are widespread (Section 12.3.2.8) and may drive increased fire frequency 
and severity in several regions, including Arctic and boreal ecosystems (Gauthier et al., 2015; Walker et al., 
2019b), Mediterranean-type ecosystems (Turco et al., 2014; Jin et al., 2015), degraded tropical forests 
(Aragão et al., 2018), and tropical forest-savanna transition zones (Lehmann et al., 2014).   
 
Wildfire is included in some CMIP6 ESMs (Table 5.4) and is thus only partially represented in estimates of 
carbon-climate feedbacks from these models. The CMIP5 ESMs that include fire project 8–58% increases of 
fire carbon emissions under future scenarios, with higher emissions under higher-warming scenarios; the 
ensemble spread is driven by differing factors such as population density, fire management, and other land-
use processes (Kloster and Lasslop, 2017). Fire dynamics in CMIP6 models, as evaluated in land-only 
configurations of CMIP6-generation land surface models, also show large variations but better agreement 
with observations (Teckentrup et al., 2019; Hantson et al., 2020; Lasslop et al., 2020).  
 
Climate change also drives changes to vegetation composition and ecosystem carbon storage through other 
disturbances such as forest dieback that lead to biome shifts in tropical forests (Cox et al., 2004; Jones et al., 
2009; Brando et al., 2014; Le Page et al., 2017; Zemp et al., 2017), and temperate and boreal regions (Joos et 
al., 2001; Lucht et al., 2006; Scheffer et al., 2012; Lasslop et al., 2016). AR5 assessed that large-scale loss of 
tropical forests due to climate change is unlikely (WGI, Section 6.4.9). Newer ecosystem modelling 
approaches that include a greater degree of ecosystem heterogeneity and diversity show a reduced sensitivity 
of such forest dieback-type changes (Levine et al., 2016; Sakschewski et al., 2016), supporting the AR5 
assessment (Section 5.4.8). Beyond such biome shifts, observations of tropical forests also show that 
increasing tree mortality rates within tropical forests may reduce carbon turnover times and storage (Brienen 
et al., 2015), that increased tree mortality rates in tropical forests and elsewhere are expected with increased 
temperatures and vapor pressure deficit (Cross-chapter Box 5.1; (Allen et al., 2015; McDowell et al., 2018; 
Grossiord et al., 2020), and that these processes are not well represented in ESMs (Powell et al., 2013; Fisher 
et al., 2018). An ensemble of land models that include ecological processes such as forest demography 
shows that changes to mortality may be a more important driver of carbon dynamics than changes to 
productivity (Friend et al., 2014).  
 
Overall, climate change will force widespread increases in fire weather throughout the world (Section 
12.3.2.8). Because of incomplete inclusion of fire in ESMs, a separate compilation of fire-driven carbon-
climate feedback estimates (Eliseev et al., 2014a; Harrison et al., 2018) (section 5.4.8). There is low 
agreement in magnitude and medium agreement in sign, which alongside other literature (Jones et al., 2020), 
leads to an assessment of medium confidence that fire represents a positive carbon-climate feedback, but very 
low confidence in the magnitude of that feedback. Other disturbances such as tree mortality will increase 
across several ecosystems (medium agreement) with decreased vegetation carbon (medium confidence). 
However, the lack of model agreement and lack of key process representation in ESMs lead to a low 
confidence assessment in the projected magnitude of this feedback. 
 
 
### 5.4.3.3  Soil Carbon 
 
Changes to soil carbon stocks in response to climate change are a potentially strong positive feedback (Cox 
et al., 2000). Since the AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.2), there has been progress made in understanding soil carbon 
dynamics, and associated feedbacks. These include: (i) an increased understanding of and ability to quantify 
high latitude soil carbon feedbacks (Box 5.1); (ii) increased understanding of the causes responsible for soil 
carbon persistence on long timescales, particularly the interactions between decomposers and soil organic 
matter and mineral assemblages (Kleber et al., 2007; Schmidt et al., 2011; Luo et al., 2016); and (iii) 
increased understanding of soil carbon dynamics in subsurface layers (Hicks Pries et al., 2017; Balesdent et 
al., 2018). 

CMIP6 ESMs predict losses of soil carbon with warming, which are larger than climate-driven vegetation 
carbon losses (Arora et al., 2020). As in CMIP5 (Todd-Brown et al., 2013), there is also a large CMIP6 
ensemble spread in climate-driven soil carbon changes, partially driven by a large spread in the current soil 
carbon stocks predicted by the models. In CMIP5 ESMs, much of the soil carbon losses with warming can be 
traced to decreased carbon inputs, with a weaker contribution from changing soil carbon lifetimes due to 
faster decomposition rates (Koven et al., 2015a), which may be an artefact of the lack of permafrost carbon 
(Box 5.1). Isotopic constraints suggest that CMIP5 ESMs systematically overestimated the transient 
sensitivity of soil 14C responses to atmospheric 14C changes, implying that the models respond too quickly to 
changes in either inputs or turnover times and that the soil contribution to all feedbacks may thus be weaker 
than currently projected (He et al., 2016). Using natural gradients of soil carbon turnover as a constraint on 
long-term responses to warming suggests that both CMIP5 and CMIP6 ESMs may systematically 
underestimate the temperature sensitivity at high latitudes, and may overestimate the temperature sensitivity 
in the tropics (Koven et al., 2017; Wieder et al., 2018; Varney et al., 2020), although experimental soil 
warming in tropical forests suggest high sensitivity of decomposition to warming in those regions as well 
(Nottingham et al., 2020).  
 
Peat soils, where thick organic layers build up due to saturated and anoxic conditions, represent another 
possible source of carbon to the atmosphere. Peats could dry, and decompose or burn as a result of climate 
change in both high (Chaudhary et al., 2020) and tropical (Cobb et al., 2017) latitudes, and in combination 
with anthropogenic drainage of peatlands (Warren et al., 2017). Peat carbon dynamics are not included in the 
majority of CMIP6 ESMs. 
 
Soil microbial dynamics shift in response to temperature, giving rise to complex longer-term trophic effects 
that are more complex than the short-term sensitivity of decomposition to temperature. Such responses are 
observed in response to long-term warming experiments (Melillo et al., 2017). While most CMIP6 ESMs do 
not include microbial dynamics, simplified global soil models that do include such dynamics show greater 
uncertainty in projections of soil C changes, despite agreeing more closely with current observations, than 
the linear models used in most ESMs (Wieder et al., 2013; Guenet et al., 2018).  
 
In nutrient limited ecosystems, prolonged soil warming can induce a fertilisation effect through increased 
decomposition, which increases nutrient availability and thereby vegetation productivity (Melillo et al., 
2011). Models that include this process tend to show a weaker carbon-climate feedback than those that do 
not (Thornton et al., 2009; Zaehle et al., 2010; Wårlind et al., 2014; Meyerholt et al., 2020b). In CMIP6, 6 
out of 11 ESMs include a representation of the nitrogen cycle, and the mean of those models predicts a 
weaker carbon-climate feedback than the overall ensemble mean (Arora et al., 2020) (Section 5.4.8). These 
models only partly account for the interactions of nutrient effects with other processes such as shifts of 
vegetation zones under climate changes (Sakaguchi et al., 2016) leading to either changes in species 
composition or changes in plant tissue nutrient to carbon ratios (Thomas et al., 2015; Achat et al., 2016; Du 
et al., 2019).  
 
The high agreement and multiple lines of evidence that warming increases decomposition rates lead to high 
confidence that warming will overall result in carbon losses relative to a constant climate and contribute to 
the positive carbon-climate feedback (Section 5.4.8). However, the widespread in ESM projections and lack 
of model representation of key processes that may amplify or mitigate soil carbon losses on longer 
timescales (including microbial dynamics, permafrost, peatlands, and nutrients) lead to low confidence in the 
magnitude of global soil carbon losses with warming.

## 5.4.4  Climate Effects on Future Ocean Carbon Uptake  
 
### 5.4.4.1  Physical Drivers of Future Ocean Carbon Uptake and Storage 
 
The principal contribution to increasing global ocean carbon is the air-sea flux of CO₂, which changes the 
DIC inventory (Section 5.4.2) (Arora et al., 2020). The processes that influence the variability and trends of 
the ocean carbon-heat nexus are assessed in Cross-Chapter Box 5.3. Climate has three important impacts on 
the ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO₂: (i) ocean warming reduces the solubility of CO₂, which increases 
pCO₂ and increases the stratification of the mixed layer with both acting as positive feedbacks weakening the 
ocean sink (Arora et al., 2020; Cross-Chapter Box 5.3; 9.2.1); (ii) changing the temporal and spatial 
characteristics of wind stress and storm alters mixing – entrainment in the mixed layer and across the bottom 
of the mixed layer (Bronselaer et al., 2018) and (iii) both warming and wind stress influence the large scale 
MOC circulation which modifies the rate of ventilation, storage or outgassing of ocean carbon in the ocean 
interior (Section 5.2.3.1; Gruber et al., 2019; Arora et al., 2020). The land-to-ocean riverine flux and the 
carbon burial in ocean sediments also play a minor role (low confidence) (Arora et al., 2020). Based on high 
agreement of projections by coupled climate models, there is high confidence that the resultant climate-
carbon cycle feedbacks are positive but the extent of the weakening the ocean sink is scenario dependent 
(Arora et al., 2020).   
 
Regionally, the Southern Ocean is a major sink of anthropogenic CO₂ (Figure 5.8a), although challenges in 
modelling its circulation and Antarctic sea ice transport (Section 3.4.1.2; Section 9.2.3.2; Section 9.3.2) 
generate uncertainty in the response of its sink to future carbon-climate feedbacks. Increased freshwater 
input may cause a slowdown of the lower overturning circulation, leading to increased Southern Ocean 
biological carbon storage (Ito et al., 2015); alternatively, increased winds may intensify the overturning 
circulation, reducing the net CO₂ sink in the Southern Ocean (Bronselaer et al., 2018; Saunders et al., 2018). 
On centennial timescales, there is thus low confidence in the overall effect of intensifying winds in the 
Southern Ocean on CO₂ uptake.   
 
 
### 5.4.4.2  Biological Drivers of Future Ocean Carbon Uptake 
 
While physical drivers control the present-day anthropogenic carbon sink, biological processes are 
responsible for the majority of the vertical gradient in DIC (natural carbon storage). A small fraction of the 
organic carbon fixed by primary production (PP) reaches the sea floor, where it can be stored in sediments 
on geological timescales, making the biological carbon pump (BCP) an important mechanism for very long-
term CO₂ storage. Projected reductions in ocean ventilation (Section 9.2.1.4) would lengthen residence time 
and lead to DIC accumulating in the deep ocean due to organic carbon remineralisation. 
 
Since AR5 (Section 6.3.2.5.6), progress has been made in understanding the biological drivers of ocean 
carbon uptake in both coupled climate models and observations (SROCC Section 5.2.2.6). Here we focus on 
potential feedbacks between biological processes and climate.  In CMIP5 models, the direction of modelled 
PP in response to increased atmospheric CO₂ concentration and climate warming was unclear (Taucher and 
Oschlies, 2011; Laufkoetter et al., 2015). This remains the case in the CMIP6 models; indeed, inter-model 
uncertainty has increased in CMIP6 models, compared to CMIP5. The projected global multi-model mean 
change in PP in 13 models run under the SSP5−8.5 scenario project is −3 ± 9% (2080–2099 mean values 
relative to 1870–1899 ± the inter-model standard deviation; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). Under the low-
emission, high-mitigation scenario SSP1−2.6, the global change in PP is −0.56 ± 4%. Observations in the 
contemporary period provide little direct constraint on the modelled responses of PP to climate change, 
partly due to insufficiently long records (Henson et al., 2016). However, there is some indication of an 
emergent constraint on changes in tropical PP based on interannual variability derived from remote sensing 
(Kwiatkowski et al., 2017b; Section 5.4.6). 
 
In CMIP5 models run under RCP8.5, particulate organic carbon (POC) export flux is projected to decline by 
1–12% by 2100 (Taucher and Oschlies 2011; Laufkoetter et al. 2015). Similar values are predicted in 18 
CMIP6 models, with declines of 2.5–21.5% (median –14%) or 0.2–2 GtC (median –0.8 GtC) between 1900 
and 2100 under the SSP5–8.5 scenario. The mechanisms driving these changes vary widely between models 
due to differences in parameterisation of particle formation, remineralisation and plankton community 
structure.  
 
Ocean warming reduces the vertical supply of nutrients to the upper ocean due to increasing stratification 
(Section 9.2.1.4) but may also act to alleviate seasonal light limitation. The projected effect is to decrease PP 
at low latitudes and increase PP at high latitudes (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). Future changes to dust 
deposition due to desertification (Mahowald et al., 2017), alterations to the nitrogen cycle (Section 5.3.3.2; 
SROCC Section 5.2.3.1.2), and reducing sea ice cover (Ardyna and Arrigo, 2020) all have the potential to 
alter PP regionally. Higher ocean temperatures tend to result in higher metabolic rates, although respiration 
may increase more rapidly than PP (Boscolo-Galazzo et al., 2018; Brewer, 2019; Cavan et al., 2019). Ocean 
warming and reduced PP are expected to result in lower zooplankton abundance, and the expansion of OMZs 
may reduce the ability of zooplankton to remineralise POC, thus increasing the efficiency of the BCP and 
forming a negative climate feedback (Cavan et al., 2017). Increased microbial respiration due to warming 
may result in greater quantities of organic carbon transferred into the dissolved organic carbon pool (Jiao et 
al., 2014; Legendre et al., 2015; Roshan and DeVries, 2017) which, while increasing the residence time of 
carbon in the ocean, would ultimately reduce the sedimentary burial and hence sequestration on geologic 
time scales (Olivarez Lyle and Lyle, 2006).  
 
Most models project that smaller phytoplankton are favoured in future ocean conditions (medium confidence; 
Cabré et al., 2015; Fu et al., 2016; Flombaum et al., 2020) driven by warming water and/or changing nutrient 
availability, which would alter the magnitude and efficiency of the BCP by altering the sinking speed, 
respiration rate and aggregation/fragmentation of sinking particles. There is low confidence in the sign of the 
resulting feedback: regions in which small phytoplankton dominate may have a more efficient pump, 
although the total amount of organic carbon reaching the sea floor is lower (Herndl and Reinthaler, 2013; 
Bach et al., 2016; Richardson, 2019). Alternatively, an increase in small phytoplankton could result in a less 
efficient pump, due either to a greater fraction of PP being processed through the upper ocean microbial loop 
(Jiao et al., 2014) or generation of slower sinking particles (Guidi et al., 2009; Leung et al., 2021). Variable 
phytoplankton stoichiometry is predicted to increase the amount of carbon stored via the BCP relative to the 
amount of PP, so that fixed stoichiometry models (as in CMIP5) may underestimate cumulative ocean 
carbon uptake to 2100 by 0.5–3.5% (2–15 PgC) (RCP8.5 scenario; Kwiatkowski et al., 2018). Other climate 
effects such as deoxygenation or ocean acidification could also result in alterations to the magnitude and 
efficiency of the BCP (Krumhardt et al., 2019; Raven et al., 2021; Taucher et al., 2021).  
 
Based on high agreement across multiple lines of evidence and physical understanding there is thus high 
confidence that feedbacks to climate will arise from alterations to the magnitude and efficiency of the BCP 
changing PP, and the depth of remineralisation.  However, the complexity of the mechanisms involved in the 
export and remineralisation of POC result in low confidence in the magnitude and sign of biological 
feedbacks to climate. Nevertheless, improved model representation of PP and the BCP is required (which 
requires better observational constraints), as the contribution of biological processes to CO₂ uptake is 
expected to become more significant with continued climate change (Hauck et al., 2015). 
 
 
## 5.4.5  Carbon Cycle Projections in Earth System Models 
 
This section summarises future projections of land and ocean carbon sinks from the latest ESMs. ESMs are 
the basis for century timescale projections (Chapter 4), and for detection and attribution studies (Chapter 3). 
These models aim to simulate the evolution of the carbon sources and sinks on land and in the ocean, in 
addition to the physical components of the climate system. ESMs include interactions between many of the 
processes and feedbacks described in Sections 5.4.1 to 5.4.4. 
 
ESMs are now integral to the coupled model intercomparison project. Model output data from CMIP5 was 
analysed in the AR5, while data from CMIP6 forms the basis for the analysis presented in this subsection. 
The CMIP5 ESMs discussed in AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.2) produced a wide range of projections of future 
CO₂ (Friedlingstein et al., 2014) primarily associated with different magnitudes of carbon-climate and 
carbon-concentration feedbacks (Arora et al., 2013), but also exacerbated by differences in the simulation of 
the net carbon release from land-use change (Brovkin et al., 2013). A key deficiency of almost all CMIP5 
ESMs was the neglect of nutrient limitations on CO₂-fertilisation of land plant photosynthesis (Zaehle et al., 
2015) (see Section 5.4.1). 
 
Some CMIP6 models considered in this report now include nitrogen limitations on land vegetation growth, 
along with many other added processes compared to CMIP5. Table 5.4 summarises characteristics of the 
land and ocean carbon cycle models used in CMIP6 ESMs (Arora et al., 2020). In CMIP6, most ocean 
carbon cycle models (8 of 11) track three or more limiting nutrients (most often nitrogen, phosphorus, 
silicon, iron), and represent two or more phytoplankton types. More than half of the land carbon cycle 
models (6 of 11) now include an interactive nitrogen cycle, and almost half (5 of 11) represent forest fires. 
However, even for CMIP6, very few models explicitly represent vegetation dynamics (3 of 11) or permafrost 
carbon (2 of 11).  Despite these remaining limitations, the carbon cycle components of CMIP6 represent an 
advance on those in CMIP5 as they represent additional important processes (e.g. nitrogen-limitations on the 
land carbon sink, iron-limitations on ocean ecosystems).

ESMs can be driven by anthropogenic CO₂ emissions (‘emissions-driven’ runs), in which case atmospheric 
CO₂ concentration is a predicted variable; or by prescribed time-varying atmospheric concentrations 
(‘concentration-driven’ runs). In concentration-driven runs, simulated land and ocean carbon sinks respond 
to the prescribed atmospheric CO₂ and resulting changes in climate, but do not feed back through changes in 
the atmospheric CO₂ concentration. Concentration-driven runs are used to diagnose the carbon emissions 
consistent with the SSPs and other prescribed concentration scenarios (Section 5.5). In this subsection we 
specifically analyse results from concentration-driven ESM projections.  
 
 
### 5.4.5.1  Evaluation of the Contemporary Carbon Cycle in Concentration-Driven Runs 
 
Models need to be compared to as wide an array of observational benchmarks as possible in order to have 
confidence in their projections. This is particularly the case for highly-uncertain land carbon cycle feedbacks 
( Arora et al., 2013; Friedlingstein et al., 2014b). Land models within ESMs can be compared to multiple 
different datasets of processes such as gross carbon uptake, physical predictions such as leaf area and carbon 
stocks which influence carbon fluxes and are diagnostic of carbon turnover times, as well as linkages 
between carbon and water cycles and other aspects of the terrestrial carbon cycle. To provide these multiple 
orthogonal constraints, a model benchmarking system, the international land model benchmarking (ILAMB), 
has been developed (Collier et al., 2018).   
 
Figure 5.22 shows an overview set of land (Figure 5.22a) and ocean (Figure 5.22b) benchmarks applied to 
both the CMIP5 and CMIP6 historical simulations. There is good evidence of an improvement in model 
performance from CMIP5 (in yellow) to CMIP6 (in green), in both the land and ocean, based on these 
benchmarks. The mean of the CMIP6 land models outperform or perform equivalently to the mean of the 
CMIP5 land models on all available metrics.

### 5.4.5.2  Evaluation of Historical Carbon Cycle Simulations in Concentration-Driven Runs 
 
This section evaluates concentration-driven historical simulations of changes in land and ocean cumulative 
carbon uptake, against observation-based estimates from GCP (Le Quéré et al., 2018a). For each model, 
common historical land-use changes were prescribed (Jones et al., 2016a).  
 
Figure 5.23 shows global annual mean values from CMIP6 concentration-driven runs for 1850 to 2014. The 
ocean carbon cycle models reproduce historical carbon uptake well, with the model range for the global 
ocean carbon sink in 2014 (2.3–2.7 GtC yr<sup>–1</sup>) clustering around the central GCP estimate of 2.6 ± 0.5 GtC yr<sup>–1</sup>.
Simulated cumulative ocean carbon uptake (1850–2014) ranges from 110 to 166 GtC, with a model mean 
of 131 ± 17 PgC which is lower than the GCP estimate of 150 ± 25 GtC (Figure 5.23a). This suggests that 
CMIP6 models may slightly underestimate historical ocean carbon uptake (Watson et al., 2020). 
 
The land carbon cycle components of historical ESM simulations show a larger range, with simulated 
cumulative land carbon uptake (1850–2014) spanning the range from –47 to +21 GtC, compared to the GCP 
estimate of –12 ± 50 GtC (Figure 5.22b). This range is due in part to the complications of simulating the 
difference between carbon uptake by intact ecosystems and the direct release of carbon due to land-use 
change (Hajima et al., 2020a). There is high confidence that the land continues to dominate the overall 
uncertainty in the projected response of the global carbon cycle to climate change. 
 
 
<figref>5.23</figref> 

 
### 5.4.5.3  Evaluation of Latitudinal Distribution of Simulated Carbon Sinks 
 
This distinction between the relatively high fidelity with which the ocean carbon sink is simulated, and the 
much wider range of simulations of the land carbon sink, is also evident in the zonal distribution of the sinks 
(Figure 5.24). We compare the ESM simulations to estimates from three atmospheric inversion models: 
CAMS (Chevallier et al., 2005), CT 2017 (Peters et al., 2007) and MIROC-ATM4 (Saeki and Patra, 2017). 
The ocean carbon cycle components of CMIP6 ESMs are able to simulate the tropical CO₂ source and mid-
latitude CO₂ sink, with relatively small model spread (Figure 5.24a). The CMIP6 ensemble (red wedge) 
simulates a larger ocean carbon sink at 50oN and a weaker sink in the Southern Ocean, than the inversion 
estimate, but with some evidence of a reduction in these residual errors compared to CMIP5 (blue wedge). 
The spread in inversion fluxes arises primarily from differences in the atmospheric CO₂ measurement 
networks and from transport model uncertainties.   
 
It has been previously noted that AR5 models tended to overestimate land-uptake in the tropics and 
underestimate uptake in the northern mid-latitudes, compared to inversion estimates. The inclusion of 
nitrogen limitations on CO₂-fertilisation within CMIP6 models was expected to reduce this discrepancy 
(Anav et al., 2013). There is indeed some evidence that the CMIP6 ensemble (red wedge in Figure 5.24b) 
captures the northern land carbon sink more clearly than CMIP5 (blue wedge in Figure 5.24b), but there 
remains a tendency for the ESMs to place more of the global land carbon sink in the tropics than the mid-
latitudes, compared to the inversion estimates. Based on a consistent signal across CMIP6 ESMs, there is 
medium confidence that land carbon cycle models continue to underestimate the northern hemisphere land 
carbon sink, when compared to estimates from atmospheric inversion (Ciais et al., 2019).  
  
<figref>5.24</figref> 

### 5.4.5.4  Coupled Climate-Carbon Cycle Projections 
 
Land and ocean carbon uptake are driven primarily by increases in atmospheric CO₂ (Figure 5.25). As a 
result, the evolution of land and ocean carbon sinks differs significantly between the SSP scenarios. Under 
scenarios which have greater increases in atmospheric CO₂ (such as SSP5–8.5 and SSP3–7.0) the absolute 
values of the sinks are larger, but the fraction of implied emissions taken-up by the sinks declines through 
the 21st century. By contrast, scenarios that assume CO₂ stabilisation in the 21st century (such as SSP1–2.6 
or SSP2–4.5), have smaller absolute sinks but these sinks take-up an increasing fraction of the implied 
emissions (Figure 5.25d). These general principles apply to both the ocean and land carbon sinks. 
 
The concentration-driven CMIP6 ESMs agree well on the evolution of the global ocean carbon sink through 
the 21st century for four SSP scenarios (Figure 5.26b). The 5-year ensemble mean ocean sink declines to 0.6 
± 0.2 GtC yr<sup>–1</sup> by 2100 under SSP1–2.6, and peaks around 2080 at 5.4 ± 0.4 GtC yr<sup>–1</sup> under SSP5–8.5. 
Cumulative ocean carbon uptake from 1850 is projected to saturate at approximately 290 ± 30 GtC under 
SSP1–2.6, and to reach 520 ± 40 GtC by 2100 under SSP5–8.5 (Figure 5.25e). 
 
The ensemble mean changes in land and ocean sinks are qualitatively similar, but the land shows much 
higher interannual variability in carbon uptake (Figure 5.25c) and also a much larger spread in the model 
projections of cumulative land carbon uptake (Figure 5.25f). The 5-year ensemble mean net land carbon sink 
is projected to decline to 0.4 ± 1.0 GtC yr<sup>–1</sup> by 2100 under SSP1–2.6, and to reach around 5.6 ± 3.7 GtC yr<sup>–1</sup> 
under SSP5–8.5 (Figure 5.25b). Cumulative net land carbon uptake from 1850 is projected to saturate at 
approximately 150 ± 35 GtC under SSP1–2.6, and to reach 310 ± 130 GtC by 2100 under SSP5–8.5. 
Significant uncertainty remains in the future of the global land carbon sink, but there has been a notable 
reduction in the model spread from CMIP5 to CMIP6.  
 
<figref>5.25</figref> 
 
Geographical patterns of carbon changes for four SSP scenarios are shown in Figure 5.26, with cleared areas 
(no diagonal lines) showing agreement on the sign of the change by at least 80% of the models. In all 
scenarios the ocean sink is strongest in the Southern Ocean and North Atlantic. The land carbon sink occurs 
primarily where there are present-day forests. In the mid- and high northern latitudes, a carbon sink is 
projected as a result of the combined impacts of increasing CO₂ and warming (see Section 5.4.5.5). Changes 
in land carbon storage in the tropics also depend strongly on the assumed rate of deforestation which varies 
in magnitude across the SSPs, from relatively low rates in SSP1–2.6 to relatively high rates in SSP3–7.0. 
 
<figref>5.26</figref> 
 
In summary, oceanic and terrestrial carbon sinks are projected to continue to grow with increasing 
atmospheric concentrations of CO₂, but the fraction of emissions that is taken up by land and ocean is 
expected to decline as the CO₂ concentration increases (high confidence).  In the ensemble mean, ESMs 
suggest approximately equal global land and ocean carbon uptake for each of the SSP scenarios. However, 
the range of model projections is much larger for the land carbon sink. Despite the wide range of model 
responses, uncertainty in atmospheric CO₂ by 2100 is dominated by future anthropogenic emissions rather 
than carbon-climate feedbacks (high confidence). 
 
 
### 5.4.5.5  Linear Feedback Analysis 
 
In order to diagnose the causes of the varying time-evolution of carbon sinks, the traditional linear feedback 
approach is adopted (Friedlingstein et al., 2003), as used previously to analyse C4MIP (Friedlingstein et al., 
2006) and CMIP5 models (Arora et al., 2013). Changes in land carbon storage (∆CL) and changes in ocean 
carbon storage (∆Co) are decomposed into contributions arising from warming (∆T) and increases in CO₂ 
(∆CO₂):  

∆𝐶<sub>𝐿</sub> = 𝛽<sub>𝐿</sub> 𝛥CO<sub>2</sub> + 𝛾<sub>𝐿</sub> 𝛥T  
∆𝐶𝑜 = 𝛽𝑜 𝛥CO<sub>2</sub> + 𝛾𝑜 𝛥T  

where βL (β𝑜) and γL (γ𝑜) are coefficients that represent the sensitivity of land (ocean) carbon storage to 
changes in CO₂ and global mean temperature respectively. This feedback formalism is one of several that 
have been proposed for analysing climate-carbon cycle feedbacks (Lade et al., 2018). 
 
This quasi-equilibrium framework is scenario dependent because of the timescales associated with land and 
ocean carbon uptake, as discussed in AR5 (WGI, Box 6.4). However, it is retained here for traceability with 
AR5. This approach has been used to define a number of emergent constraints on carbon cycle feedbacks 
(Section 5.4.6) and to reconstruct the transient climate response to emissions (TCRE) (Jones and 
Friedlingstein, 2020), as in Section 5.5. In order to minimise the confounding effect of the scenario 
dependence, β and γ  values are diagnosed from idealised runs in which a 1% per year increase in 
atmospheric CO₂ concentration is prescribed, as for AR5 (WGI, Box 6.4) (Arora et al., 2013). Values of 
β are calculated from ‘biogeochemical’ runs in which the prescribed CO₂ increases do not affect climate, and 
these are then used to isolate γ  values in fully-coupled runs in which both climate and CO₂ change 
(Friedlingstein et al., 2003). 
 
Table 5.5 shows the global land and global ocean values of β and γ  for each of the CMIP6 ESMs (Arora et 
al., 2020). Also shown in the last two rows are the ensemble mean and standard deviation across the 
ensemble, for CMIP6 and CMIP5. In both ensembles, the largest uncertainties are in the sensitivity of land 
carbon storage to CO₂ (βL) and the sensitivity of land carbon storage to temperature (γL). The more 
widespread modelling of nitrogen limitations in CMIP6 was expected to lead to reductions in both of these 
feedback parameters. There is indeed some evidence for that with ensemble mean γL moving from –58 ± 38 
GtC K-1 to –33 ± 33 GtC K-1. Between CMIP5 and CMIP6, there are also reductions in ensemble mean βo 
(0.82 to 0.77 GtC ppm-1), βL (0.93 to 0.89 GtC K-1) and γo (–17.3 to –16.9 GtC K-1), but these are 
progressively less significant compared to the model spread in each case. 
 
<tableref>5.5</tableref>
 
In these idealised 1% per year CO₂ runs, the CMIP6 models show reasonable agreement on the patterns of 
carbon uptake and also on the separate impacts of CO₂ increase and climate change (Figure 5.27). For the 
ensemble mean, increasing atmospheric CO₂ increases carbon uptake by the oceans, especially in the  
 
Southern Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean; and on the land, especially in tropical and boreal forests 
(β, Figure 5.27a). Climate change further enhances land carbon storage in the boreal zone but has a 
compensating negative impact on the carbon sink in tropical and subtropical lands, and in the North Atlantic 
Ocean (γ, Figure 5.27b). Overall, the ensemble mean of the CMIP6 ESMs models indicates increasing 
carbon storage with CO₂ in almost all locations (Figure 5.27c). 
 
<figref>5.27</figref> 
 
## 5.4.6  Emergent constraints to reduce uncertainties in projections 
 
Emergent constraints are based on relationships between observable aspects of the current or past climate 
(such as trends or variability), and uncertain aspects of future climate change (such as the strength of 
particular feedbacks). These relationships are evident across an ensemble of models. When combined with 
an observational estimate of the trend or variability in the real climate, such emergent relationships can yield 
‘emergent constraints’ on future climate change (Hall et al., 2019). At the time of the AR5 (WGI, 9.8.3), 
there had been relatively few applications of the technique to constrain carbon cycle sensitivities, but there 
have been many studies published since (see for example summary in Cox, (2019)). Figure 5.28 shows some 
key published emergent constraints on the carbon cycle in ESMs.  
 
<figref>5.28</figref> 
 
## 5.4.7  Climate Feedbacks from CH₄ and N₂O  
 
Sources and sinks of CH₄ and N₂O respond both directly and indirectly to atmospheric CO₂ concentration 
and climate change, and thereby give rise to additional biogeochemical feedbacks in the climate system, 
which may amplify or attenuate climate-carbon cycle feedbacks (Gasser et al., 2017; Lade et al., 2018; 
Denisov et al., 2019). Many of these of feedbacks are only partially understood, and thus were only partially 
addressed in AR5 (WGI, Sections 6.3.3, 6.3.4, 6.4.7). Since AR5, a growing body of estimates from ESMs, 
as well as independent modelling and observation-based studies, enable improved estimates of the associated 
feedbacks.  
 
The goal of this section is to assess the climate feedback parameters α, as it is defined in Section 7.4.1.1, for 
CH₄ and N₂O biogeochemical feedbacks. The strength of the feedbacks is estimated in a linear framework 
(Gregory et al., 2009), using the radiative forcing equations for CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O (Etminan et al., 2016). In 
addition to estimates from ESMs, the feedback parameter α is estimated from independent estimates of 
surface emission climate sensitivities and atmospheric box models, following (Arneth et al., 2010; Thornhill 
et al., 2020). These assessed feedback parameters are used in Section 7.4.2.5. 
 
CH₄ feedbacks may arise from changing wetland emissions (including rice farming) and from sources that 
are expected to grow under climate change (e.g. related to permafrost thaw, fires, and freshwater bodies). 
CH₄ emissions from wetlands and landfills generally increase with warming due to enhanced decomposition 
with higher temperatures, thereby potentially providing a positive CH₄ feedback on climate (Dean et al., 
2018). The contribution of wetlands to interannual variability of atmospheric CH₄ is shaped by the different 
impacts of temperature and precipitation anomalies on wetland emissions (e.g. during El Niño episodes) and 
therefore the relationship between climate anomalies and the wetland contribution to the CH₄ growth rate is 
complex (Pison et al., 2013; Nisbet et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2020b). As assessed by SROCC (IPCC, 
2019b), there is high agreement across model simulations that wetlands CH₄ emissions will increase in the 
21st century, but low agreement in the magnitude of the change (Denisov et al., 2013; Shindell et al., 2013a; 
Stocker et al., 2013a; Zhang et al., 2017; Koffi et al., 2020). Climate change increases wetland emissions 
(Gedney, 2004; Volodin, 2008; Ringeval et al., 2011; Denisov et al., 2013; Shindell et al., 2013a; Gedney et 
al., 2019) and gives rise to an estimated  wetland CH₄-climate feedback of 0.03 ± 0.01 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> °C<sup>–1</sup> (mean ± 1 
standard deviation; limited evidence, high agreement) (Arneth et al., 2010; Shindell et al., 2013b; Stocker et 
al., 2013a; Zhang et al., 2017). The effect of rising CO₂ on productivity, and therefore on the substrate for 
methanogenesis, can further increase the projected increase in wetland CH₄ emissions (Ringeval et al., 2011; 
Melton et al., 2013). Model projections accounting for the combined effects of CO₂ and climate change 
suggest a potentially larger climate feedback (0.01–0.16 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> °C<sup>–1</sup>; limited evidence, limited agreement) 
(Gedney et al., 2019; Thornhill et al., 2020). Methane release from wetlands depends on the nutrient 
availability for methanogenic and methanotrophic microorganisms that can further modify this feedback 
(Stepanenko et al., 2016; Donis et al., 2017; Beaulieu et al., 2019). Methane emissions from thermokarst 
ponds and wetlands resulting from permafrost thaw, is estimated to contribute an additional CH₄-climate 
feedback of 0.01 [0.003–0.04, 5–95th percentile range] W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> °C<sup>–1</sup> (limited evidence, moderate agreement).  
 
Methane release from wildfires may increase by a up to a factor of 1.5 during the 21st century (Eliseev et al., 
2014a, 2014b; Kloster and Lasslop, 2017). However, given the contemporary estimate for CH₄ from 
wildfires of no more than 16 TgCH₄ yr<sup>–1</sup> (van der Werf et al., 2017; Saunois et al., 2020), this feedback is 
small, adding no more than 40 ppb to the atmospheric CH₄ by the end of the 21st century (medium 
confidence). Methane emissions from pan-Arctic freshwater bodies is also estimated to increase by 16 
TgCH₄ yr<sup>–1</sup> in the 21st century (Tan and Zhuang, 2015). Emissions from subsea and permafrost methane 
hydrates are not expected to change substantially in the 21st century (Section 5.4.8). 
 
Land biosphere models show high agreement that long-term warming will increase N₂O release from 
terrestrial ecosystems (Xu‐Ri et al., 2012; Stocker et al., 2013b; Zaehle, 2013a; Tian et al., 2019). A positive 
land N₂O climate feedback is consistent with paleo-evidence based on reconstructed and modelled emissions 
during the last deglacial period (Schilt et al., 2014; Fischer et al., 2019b; Joos et al., 2020). The response of 
terrestrial N₂O emissions to atmospheric CO₂ increase and associated warming is dependent on nitrogen 
availability (van Groenigen et al., 2011; Butterbach-Bahl et al., 2013; Tian et al., 2019). Model-based 
estimates do not account for the potentially strong emission increases in Boreal and Arctic ecosystems 
associated with future warming and permafrost thaw (Elberling et al., 2010; Voigt et al., 2017). There is 
medium confidence that the land N₂O climate feedback is positive, but low confidence in the magnitude (0.02 
± 0.01 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> °C<sup>–1</sup>). 
 
Climate change will also affect N₂O production in the ocean (Codispoti, 2010; Freing et al., 2012; Bopp et 
al., 2013; Rees et al., 2016; Breider et al., 2019). Model projections in the 21st century show a 4–12% 
decrease in ocean N₂O emissions under RCP8.5 due to a combination of factors including increased ocean 
stratification, decreases in ocean productivity, and the impact of increasing atmospheric N₂O abundance on 
the air-sea flux, corresponding to an ocean N₂O climate feedback of –0.008 ± 0.002 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> °C<sup>–1</sup> (high 
agreement, limited evidence) (Martinez-Rey et al., 2015; Landolfi et al., 2017; Battaglia and Joos, 2018). On 
millennial timescales, the ocean N₂O climate feedback may be positive, owing to ocean deoxygenation and 
long-term increases in remineralisation (Battaglia and Joos, 2018b). 
 
Based-on these studies, there is medium confidence that the combined climate feedback parameter for CH₄ 
and N₂O is positive, but there is low confidence in the magnitude of the estimate (0.05 (0.02–0.09) W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> °C-
1, 5–95th percentile range).  
 
 
## 5.4.8  Combined Biogeochemical Climate Feedback  
 
This section assesses the magnitude of the combined biogeochemical feedback in the climate system (Figure 
5.29) by integrating evidence from: carbon-cycle projections represented in Earth system models (Section 
5.4.5.5), independent estimates of CO₂ emissions due to permafrost thaw (Box 5.1) and fire (Section 5.4.3.2), 
natural CH₄ and N₂O emissions (Section 5.4.7), and aerosol and atmospheric chemistry (Section 6.3.6). We 
derive a physical climate feedback parameter α, as defined in Section 7.4.1.1, for CO₂-based feedbacks using 
the linear framework proposed by Gregory et al. (2009), using the radiative forcing equations for CO₂ 
(Etminan et al., 2016). 
 
<figref>5.29</figref>  
 
The climate feedback parameter for CO₂ (–1.13 ± 0.45 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> °C<sup>–1</sup>, mean and 1 standard-deviation range) is 
dominated by the contribution of the CO₂-induced increase of ocean and land carbon storage (–1.46 ± 0.41 
W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> °C<sup>–1</sup>, corresponding to a βL+O of 1.66 ± 0.31 PgC ppm-1), with smaller contributions from the carbon 
cycle’s response to climate (0.24 ± 0.17 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> °C<sup>–1</sup>, corresponding to γL+O of –50 ± 34 PgC °C<sup>–1</sup>), and 
emissions from permafrost thaw (0.09 [0.02–0.20] W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> °C<sup>–1</sup>, corresponding to γ of –18 [3–41] PgC °C<sup>–1</sup>, 
mean and 5–95th percentile range) (Figure 5.29a). This estimate does not include an estimate of the fire-
related CO₂ feedback (range: 0.01–0.06 W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> °C<sup>–1</sup>), as only limited evidence was available to inform its 
assessment. The sum (mean and 5–95th percentile range) of feedbacks from natural emissions of CH₄ 
including permafrost thaw, and N₂O (0.05 [0.02–0.09] W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> °C<sup>–1</sup>), and feedbacks from aerosol and 
atmospheric chemistry (–0.20 [–0.41 to 0.01] W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> °C<sup>–1</sup>) leads to an estimate of the non-CO₂ 
biogeochemical feedback parameter of –0.15 [–0.36 to 0.06] W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> °C<sup>–1</sup>. There is low confidence in the 
estimate of the non-CO₂ biogeochemical feedbacks, due to the large range in the estimates of α for some 
individual feedbacks (Figure 5.29c), which can be attributed to the diversity in how models account for these 
feedbacks, limited process-level understanding, and the existence of known feedbacks for which there is not 
sufficient evidence to assess the feedback strength.  
 
CO₂ and non-CO₂ biogeochemical feedbacks are an important component of the assessment of TCRE and 
the remaining carbon budget (Section 5.5). The feedbacks of the carbon cycle of CO₂ and climate are 
implicitly taken account in the TCRE assessment, because they are represented in the various underlying 
lines of evidence. Other feedback contributions, such as the non-CO₂ biogeochemical feedback, can be 
converted into a carbon-equivalent feedback term (γ; Section 5.4.5.5, 7.6) by reverse application of the linear 
feedback approximation (Gregory et al., 2009). The contributions of non-CO₂ biogeochemical feedbacks 
combine to a linear feedback term of 30 ± 27 PgCeq °C<sup>–1</sup> (1 standard deviation range, 111 ± 98 Gt CO₂eq °C-
1), including a feedback term of –11 (–18 to –5) PgCeq °C<sup>–1</sup> (5th–95th percentile range, –40 (–62 to –18) Gt 
CO₂eq °C<sup>–1</sup>) from natural CH₄ and N₂O sources. The biogeochemical feedback from permafrost thaw leads to 
a combined linear feedback term of –21 ± 12 PgCeq °C<sup>–1</sup> (1 standard deviation range –77 ± 44 Gt CO₂eq °C-
1). For the integration of these feedbacks in the assessment of the remaining carbon budget (Section 5.5.2), 
two individual non-CO₂ feedbacks (tropospheric ozone, and methane lifetime) are captured in the AR6-
calibrated emulators (Box 7.1). Excluding those two contributions, the resulting combined linear feedback 
term for application in Section 5.5.2 is assessed at a reduction of 7 ± 27 PgCeq °C<sup>–1</sup> (1 standard deviation 
range, –26 ± 97 PgCeq °C<sup>–1</sup>). For the same reasons as for the feedback terms expressed in W⋅m<sup>–2</sup> °C<sup>–1</sup> (see 
above), there is overall low confidence in the magnitude of these feedbacks.  
 
 
## 5.4.9  Abrupt Changes and Tipping Points 
 
The applicability of the linear feedback framework (Section 5.4.5.5) suggests that large-scale 
biogeochemical feedbacks are approximately linear in the forcing from changes in CO₂ and climate. 
Nevertheless, regionally the biosphere is known to be capable of producing abrupt changes or even ‘tipping 
points’ (Higgins and Scheiter, 2012; Lasslop et al., 2016). Abrupt change is defined as a change in the 
system that is substantially faster than the typical rate of the changes in its history (Chapter 1, Section 1.4.5). 
A related matter is a tipping point: a critical threshold beyond which a system reorganizes, often abruptly 
and/or irreversibly. Possible abrupt changes in the Earth system include those related to ecosystems and 
biogeochemistry (Lenton et al., 2008; Steffen et al., 2018): tropical and boreal forest dieback; and release of 
greenhouse gases from permafrost and methane clathrates (Table 5.6). It is not currently possible to carry out 
a full assessment of proposed abrupt changes and tipping points in the biogeochemical cycles. In this section 
we therefore focus instead on estimating upper limits on the possible impact of abrupt changes on the 
evolution of atmospheric GHGs out to 2100, for comparison to the impact of direct anthropogenic emissions.

### 5.4.9.1  Assessment of biogeochemical tipping points 
 
#### 5.4.9.1.1  Forest Dieback  
Published examples of abrupt biogeochemical changes in models include tropical rain forest dieback (Cox et 
al., 2004; Jones et al., 2009; Brando et al., 2014; Le Page et al., 2017; Zemp et al., 2017), and temperate and 
boreal forest dieback (Joos et al., 2001; Lucht et al., 2006; Scheffer et al., 2012; Lasslop et al., 2016) (see 
also Section 5.4.3). Such transitions may be related to (i) large-scale changes in mean climate conditions 
crossing particular climate thresholds (Joos et al., 2001; Cox et al., 2004; Lucht et al., 2006; Hirota et al., 
2011; Scheffer et al., 2012; Le Page et al., 2017; Zemp et al., 2017), (ii) temperature and precipitation 
extremes (Staver et al., 2011; Higgins and Scheiter, 2012; Scheffer et al., 2012; Pavlov, 2015; Zemp et al., 
2017), or (iii) possible enhancement and intermittency in fire activity (Staver et al., 2011; Higgins and 
Scheiter, 2012; Lasslop et al., 2016; Brando et al., 2020). Simulated changes in forest cover are a 
combination of the effects of CO₂ on photosynthesis and water-use efficiency (Section 5.4.1), and the effects 
of climate change on photosynthesis, respiration and disturbance (Section 5.4.3).  In ESMs, direct CO₂ 
effects tend to enhance forest growth, but the impacts of climate change vary between being predominantly 
negative in the tropics and predominantly positive in the boreal zone (Figure 5.27). 
 
Most ESMs project continuing carbon accumulation in tropical forests as a result of direct CO₂ effects 
overwhelming the negative effects of climate change (Huntingford et al., 2013; Drijfhout et al., 2015; 
Boulton et al., 2017). In the real world, forests may be less vulnerable to climate changes than those 
modelled in ESMs because of the greater plant trait diversity which confers additional resilience (Reyer et 
al., 2015; Levine et al., 2016; Sakschewski et al., 2016), and also because of possible acclimation of 
vegetation to warming (Good et al., 2011, 2013; Lloret et al., 2012; Mercado et al., 2018). Contrary, forests 
may be more vulnerable in the real world due to indirect climate change effects such as insect outbreaks and 
diseases not considered here (Section 5.4.3.2) or model limitations in representing the effects disturbances 
such as wildfire and droughts. In general, forests are most vulnerable when climate change is combined with 
increased rates of direct deforestation  (Nobre et al., 2016; Le Page et al., 2017).  
 
In order to estimate an upper limit on the impact of Amazon forest dieback on atmospheric CO₂, we consider 
the very unlikely limiting case of negligible direct-CO₂ effects (Section 5.4.1). Emergent constraint 
approaches (Section 5.4.6) may be used to estimate an overall loss of tropical land carbon due to climate 
change alone, of around 50 PgC per oC of tropical warming (Cox et al., 2013b; Wenzel et al., 2014). This 
implies an upper limit to the release of tropical land carbon of <200 PgC over the 21st century (assuming 
tropical warming of <4oC, and no CO₂-fertilisation), which translates to dCO₂/dt < 0.5 ppm yr<sup>–1</sup>.   
 
Boreal forest dieback is not expected to change the atmospheric CO₂ concentration substantially because 
forest  loss at the south is partly compensated by (i) temperate forest invasion into the previous boreal area 
and (ii) boreal forest gain at the north (Friend et al., 2014; Kicklighter et al., 2014; Schaphoff et al., 2016) 
(medium confidence). An upper estimate of this magnitude, based on statistical modelling of climate change 
alone, is of 27 Pg vegetation C loss in the southern boreal forest, which is roughly balanced by gains in the 
northern zone (Koven, 2013). Carbon release from vegetation and soil due to wildfires in boreal regions 
(Eliseev et al., 2014b; Turetsky et al., 2015; Walker et al., 2019a) is also not expected to change this estimate 
substantially because of its small present-day value of about 0.2 PgC yr<sup>–1</sup> (van der Werf et al., 2017), and 
because of likely increases in precipitation in boreal regions (Chapter 4, Section 4.5.1). 
 
 
#### 5.4.9.1.2  Biogenic Emissions Following Permafrost Thaw 
There is large uncertainty in release of GHGs from permafrost in the 21st century with the largest of these 
estimates implying tens to hundreds of gigatons of carbon released in the form of CO₂ (Box 5.1) and 
methane emissions up to 100 TgCH₄ yr<sup>–1</sup> (Box 5.1). A carbon dioxide release of such magnitude would lead 
to an increase in the CO₂ accumulation rate in the atmosphere of ≤1 ppm yr<sup>–1</sup>. These emissions develop at 
multi-decadal timescale. Assuming a CH₄ lifetime in the atmosphere of the order of 10 years and the 
associated feedback parameter of 1.34 ± 0.04 (Chapter 6, Section 6.2.2.1), this would increase the 
atmospheric methane content by about 500 ppb over the century, corresponding to a rate of ≤10 ppb yr 1. 
Irrespective of its origin, additional methane accumulation of such a magnitude is not expected to modify the 
temperature response to anthropogenic emissions by more than a few tens of °C cent (Gedney, 2004; Eliseev 
et al., 2008; Denisov et al., 2013). Emissions from the permafrost are assessed in Box 5.1.  
 
 
#### 5.4.9.1.3  Methane Release from Clathrates 
The total global clathrate reservoir is estimated to contain 1500–2000 PgC (Archer et al., 2009; Ruppel and 
Kessler, 2017), held predominantly in ocean sediments with only an estimated 20 PgC in and under 
permafrost (Ruppel, 2015). The present-day methane release from shelf clathrates is <10 TgCH₄ yr<sup>–1</sup> 
(Kretschmer et al., 2015; Saunois et al., 2020). Despite polar amplification (Chapter 7), substantial releases 
from the permafrost-embedded subsea clathrates is very unlikely (Minshull et al., 2016; Malakhova and 
Eliseev, 2017, 2020). This is consistent with an overall small release of methane from the shelf clathrates 
during the last deglacial despite large reorganisations in climate state (Bock et al., 2017; Petrenko et al., 
2017; Dyonisius et al., 2020). The long timescales associated with clathrate destabilisation makes it unlikely 
that CH₄ release from the ocean to the atmosphere will deviate markedly from the present-day value through 
the 21st century (Hunter et al., 2013), corresponding to no more than additional 20 ppb of atmospheric 
methane (i.e. <0.2 ppb yr<sup>–1</sup>). Another possible source of CH₄ are gas clathrates in deeper terrestrial 
permafrost and below it (Buldovicz et al., 2018; Chuvilin et al., 2018), which may have caused recent craters 
in the north of  Russia (Arzhanov et al., 2016, 2020; Arzhanov and Mokhov, 2017; Kizyakov et al., 2017, 
2018). Land clathrates are formed at depths >200 m (Ruppel and Kessler, 2017; Malakhova and Eliseev, 
2020), which precludes a substantial response to global warming over the next few centuries and associated 
emissions.  
 
Thus, it is very unlikely that CH₄ emissions from clathrates will substantially warm the climate system over 
the next few centuries. 
 
 
### 5.4.9.2  Abrupt Changes Detected in ESM Projections 
 
Projecting abrupt changes is intrinsically difficult, because by definition abrupt changes occur in a small 
region of the parameter and/or forcing space. At the time of the AR5 there was no available systematic study 
of abrupt changes or tipping points in ESMs. An analysis of ESMs since the AR5 has identified a number of 
abrupt changes in the CMIP5 ensemble (Drijfhout et al., 2015; Bathiany et al., 2020). These include abrupt 
changes in tropical forests and high-latitude greening, permafrost thaw, and vegetation composition change 
(Bathiany et al., 2020). Most modelled abrupt changes were detected in boreal and tundra regions, with few 
models showing Amazon forest dieback (Bathiany et al., 2020).  
 
Based on the evidence presented in this section, we conclude that abrupt changes and tipping points in the 
biogeochemical cycles lead to additional uncertainty in 21st century GHG concentrations changes, but these 
are very likely to be small compared to the uncertainty associated with future anthropogenic emissions (high 
confidence).  
 
 
## 5.4.10  Long Term Response past 2100 
 
AR5 assessed with very high confidence that the carbon cycle in the ocean and on land will continue to 
respond to climate change and rising atmospheric CO₂ concentrations created during the 21st century (WGI, 
Chapter 6, Executive Summary). Since AR5, experiments with the CESM1 model under the RCP8.5 
extension scenario out to 2300, suggest that both land and ocean carbon-climate feedbacks strengthen in 
time, land and ocean carbon-concentration feedbacks weaken, and the relative importance of ocean sinks 
versus land sinks increases (Randerson et al., 2015). Under high emissions scenarios, this relative 
strengthening of land carbon-climate feedbacks leads the terrestrial biosphere to shift from sink to source at 
some point after 2100 in all of the CMIP5 ESMs and CMIP5-era EMICs (Tokarska et al., 2016). The 
strengthening of land and ocean carbon-climate feedbacks projected beyond 2100 under high emissions 
scenarios offsets the declining climate sensitivity to incremental increases of CO₂, leading to a net 
strengthening of carbon cycle feedbacks, as measured by the gain parameter, from one century to the next 
(Randerson et al., 2015).  
 
Figure 5.30 shows carbon cycle changes to 2300 under three SSP scenarios with long-term extensions: 
SSP5–8.5, SSP5–3.4–overshoot, and SSP1–2.6, for four CMIP6 ESMs and one EMIC. Under all three 
scenarios, all five models project a reversal of the terrestrial carbon cycle from a sink to a source. However, 
the reasons for these reversals under very high emissions and low/negative emissions are very different.  
Under the SSP5–8.5 scenario, the terrestrial carbon-climate feedback is projected to strengthen, while the 
carbon-concentration feedbacks weaken after emissions peak at 2100, which together drives the land to 
become a net carbon source after 2100 (Tokarska et al., 2016). The difference in both timing and magnitude 
of this transition across the ensemble, leads to an assessment of medium confidence in the likelihood and low 
confidence in the timing and strength, of the land transitioning from a net sink to a net source under such a 
scenario. Based on high agreement across all available models, we assess with high confidence that the 
ocean sink strength would weaken but not reverse under a long-term high-emissions scenario. In the SSP5–
3.4–overshoot scenario, both the terrestrial and ocean reservoirs act as transient carbon sources during the 
overshoot period, when net anthropogenic CO₂ emissions are negative and CO₂ concentrations are falling, 
and then revert to near-zero (land) or weak sink (ocean) fluxes after stabilisation of atmospheric CO₂. The 
SSP1–2.6 scenario, characterised by lower peak CO₂ concentrations, a smaller overshoot, and much less 
carbon loss from land use change, shows instead a relaxation towards a neutral biosphere on land and a 
sustained weak sink in the ocean (see also Section 5.6.2.2.1.2).

## 5.4.11  Near-Term Prediction of Ocean and Land Carbon Sinks 
 
The IPCC AR5 (WGI, Section 11.3.2) assessed near-term climate predictability based on ESMs initialised 
from the observed climate state. Since the AR5, a growing number of prediction systems have been 
developed based on ESMs that include the ocean and land carbon cycle components. Predictability of key 
physical climate variables (assessed in Chapter 4) provides a platform to establish predictive skill for 
interannual variations in the strength of the natural carbon sinks in response to internal climate variability. In 
most systems the carbon cycle components are only indirectly initialised and respond to the initialised 
climate variations (Li et al., 2019). This subsection synthesises information on predictability of the land and 
ocean carbon sinks using both the idealised potential predictability and the actual predictability skill 
measures.  
 
Longer-term memory residing in the ocean enables predictability of the ocean carbon sink (McKinley et al., 
2017; Li and Ilyina, 2018). The predictive horizon of the globally integrated air-sea CO₂ fluxes has been 
assessed in perfect-model frameworks that are based on an idealised ensemble of simulations in which each 
ensemble member serves as a verification, while no observations are assessed. Perfect-model studies provide 
an estimate of the upper range of potential predictability for the integrated air-sea CO₂ fluxes of about 2 
years globally and up to a decade in some regions (Séférian et al., 2018a; Spring and Ilyina, 2020). Evidence 
is also emerging for predictive skill of the global air-sea CO₂ fluxes of up to 6 years based-on prediction 
systems initialised with observed physical climate states (Li et al., 2019), with a potential for even longer-
term regional predictability in some regions including the North Atlantic and subpolar Southern Ocean (Li et 
al., 2016a; Lovenduski et al., 2019b).  
 
Models suggest that predictability of the air-sea CO₂ flux is related to predictability of ocean biogeochemical 
state variables such as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA) (Lovenduski et al., 2019b), 
as well as the mixed layer depth (Li et al., 2016a). Temperature variations largely control shorter-term 
predictability of the ocean carbon sink, while longer term predictability is related to non-thermal drivers such 
as ocean circulation and biology (Li et al., 2019). Although there is a substantial spatial heterogeneity, 
initialised predictions suggest stronger multi-year variations of the air-sea CO₂ flux and generally tend to 
outperform uninitialized simulations on the global scale (Li et al., 2019). The predictive skill of air-sea CO₂ 
flux shows a consistent spatial pattern in different models despite the wide range of techniques used to 
assimilate observational information (Regnier et al., 2013a). ESM-based prediction systems also demonstrate 
predictability of other marine biogeochemical properties such as net primary production (Séférian et al., 
2014; Yeager et al., 2018; Park et al., 2019) and seawater pH (Brady et al., 2020).  
 
Seasonal predictability of air-land CO₂ flux up to 6–8 months is driven by the state of ENSO (Zeng et al., 
2008; Betts et al., 2018). Fewer land carbon initialised predictions are available from decadal prediction 
systems, yet they tend to outperform the uninitialized simulations in capturing the major year-to-year 
variations as indicated by higher correlations with the Global Carbon Budget estimates. There is growing 
evidence that potential predictive skill of air-land CO₂ flux is maintained out to a lead-time of 2 years 
(Lovenduski et al., 2019a); this predictability horizon is also supported by perfect model studies (Séférian et 
al., 2018a; Spring and Ilyina, 2020). The origins of this interannual predictability are not yet fully 
understood. However, they seem to be associated with the oscillatory behaviour of ENSO (Séférian et al., 
2014) and the predictability of terrestrial ecosystem drivers such as ecosystem respiration and gross primary 
production (Lovenduski et al., 2019b). Initialised simulations suggest that observed variability in the land 
carbon sink is improved through initialisation of prediction systems with the observed state of the physical 
climate. 
 
The predictability horizon of variations in atmospheric CO₂ growth-rate are not yet fully established in the 
literature. However, predictive skill of the land and ocean carbon sinks show a potential to establish 
predictability of variations in atmospheric CO₂ up to 2 years in advance in the initialised prediction systems  
with an upper bound of up to 3 years in a perfect-model study (Spring and Ilyina, 2020); this skill is 
primarily limited by the terrestrial carbon sink predictability.  
 
 
# 5.5  Remaining Carbon Budgets  
 
Science at the time of the IPCC AR5 established a near-linear relationship between cumulative emissions of 
CO₂ and the resulting global warming (Allen et al., 2009; Matthews et al., 2009; Meinshausen et al., 2009; 
Zickfeld et al., 2009; Collins et al., 2013; Stocker et al., 2013;). The amount of global warming per unit of 
cumulated CO₂ emissions is called the transient climate response to cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide 
(TCRE). This TCRE relationship is now used to estimate the amount of CO₂ emissions that would be 
consistent with limiting global warming to specific levels (Allen et al., 2009; Matthews et al., 2009; 
Meinshausen et al., 2009; Zickfeld et al., 2009; Matthews et al., 2012; Collins et al., 2013; Stocker et al., 
2013; Knutti and Rogelj, 2015; Rogelj et al., 2016; Goodwin et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2019). The remainder 
of CO₂ emissions that would be in line with limiting global warming to a specific temperature level (while 
accounting for all other factors affecting global warming) can be estimated with help of the TCRE and is 
referred to as the remaining carbon budget (Rogelj et al., 2019; Matthews et al., 2020). Section 5.5.1 first 
assesses the TCRE as one of the core concepts underlying the notion of a remaining carbon budget and 
Section 5.5.2 then integrates this with the assessment of other contributing factors from across this 
assessment to provide a consolidated assessment following the approach of the IPCC SR1.5 (Rogelj et al., 
2018b). The historical carbon budget of CO₂ already emitted is assessed in Section 5.2.1.5.  
 
 
## 5.5.1  Transient Climate Response to Cumulative Emissions of carbon dioxide (TCRE)  
 
### 5.5.1.1  Contributing Physical Processes and Theoretical Frameworks 
 
The processes that translate emissions of CO₂ into a change in global temperature (terrestrial and oceanic 
carbon uptake, radiative forcing from CO₂, and ocean heat uptake) are governed by complex mechanisms 
that all evolve in time (Gregory et al., 2009) (Sections 3.5, 4.3, 4.5, 5.4, and 7.3, Cross-Chapter Box 5.3). 
Starting with an initial description in AR5 (Collins et al., 2013a; Stocker et al., 2013c) a body of literature 
has since expanded the understanding of physical mechanisms from which a simple proportional relationship 
between cumulative emissions of CO₂ and change in global temperature (expressed in either global mean 
surface temperature, GMST or global mean surface air temperature, GSAT) arises.  
 
Studies have focused on two key features of the TCRE relationship: (i) why the relationship is nearly 
constant in time (Goodwin et al., 2015; MacDougall and Friedlingstein, 2015; Williams et al., 2016; Ehlert et 
al., 2017; Katavouta et al., 2018); and (ii) why and under which conditions the relationship is independent on 
the historical rate (or pathway) of CO₂ emissions (MacDougall, 2017; Seshadri, 2017).  
 
There is increased confidence in the near-constancy of TCRE because of the variety of methods that have 
been used to examine this relationship: sensitivity studies with Earth system models of EMICs (Herrington 
and Zickfeld, 2014; Ehlert et al., 2017); theory-based equations used to examine Earth system model (ESM) 
and EMIC output (Goodwin et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2016, 2017c); and simple analytical models that 
capture aspects of the TCRE relationship (MacDougall and Friedlingstein, 2015). All studies agree that the 
near-constancy of the TCRE arises from compensation between the diminishing sensitivity of radiative 
forcing to CO₂ at higher atmospheric concentration, and the diminishing ability of the ocean to take up heat 
and carbon at higher cumulative emissions (Allen et al., 2009; Matthews et al., 2009; Frölicher and Paynter, 
2015; Goodwin et al., 2015; Gregory et al., 2015; MacDougall and Friedlingstein, 2015; MacDougall, 2016; 
Tokarska et al., 2016; Ehlert et al., 2017).  
 
The question whether and under which conditions the TCRE relationship is independent of the historical rate 
of CO₂ emissions (also referred to as ‘pathway independence of TCRE’) has been examined by using simple 
mathematically-tractable models (MacDougall, 2017; Seshadri, 2017). Based on the assumption that the 
cumulative fraction of carbon taken up by the terrestrial biosphere is constant, and that the climate feedback 
parameter and ocean heat uptake efficacy do not change in time, both studies agree that pathway 
independence is sensitive to the rate of CO₂ emissions, such that pathway independence is expected to 
breakdown at both very high and very low absolute CO₂ emission rates (MacDougall, 2017; Seshadri, 2017). 
Note that in pathways with strongly declining emissions, the cumulative sink fraction by the combined 
terrestrial biosphere and ocean is expected to increase (see Figure 5.25 in Section 5.4.5). The studies also 
agree that no similar relationship analogous to TCRE can be expected for short-lived non-CO₂ forcers, for 
which the annual emissions are a closer proxy for the implied warming (Collins et al., 2013a); Sections 6.4, 
7.6. MacDougall, (2017) suggests that two additional constraints are required to create pathway 
independence: first, the transport of heat and carbon into the deep ocean should be governed by processes 
with similar timescales; and second, the ratio of the net change in the atmospheric carbon pool to the net 
change in the ocean carbon pool should be close to the ratio of the enhanced longwave radiation to space (i.e. 
the radiative response of the surface) to ocean heat uptake. If these ratios are identical then TCRE would be 
completely path independent (MacDougall, 2017). If the ratios are close but not identical, TCRE would be 
only approximately path independent over a wide range of cumulative emissions (MacDougall, 2017) 
(Cross-Chapter Box 5.3). 
 
The land carbon cycle does not appear to play a fundamental role in the origin of the linearity and path-
independence of TCRE (Goodwin et al., 2015; MacDougall and Friedlingstein, 2015; Ehlert et al., 2017), 
but, in contrast to the ocean sink, dominates the uncertainty in the magnitude of TCRE by modulating the 
cumulative airborne fraction of carbon (Goodwin et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2016; Katavouta et al., 2018; 
Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020). Some terrestrial carbon cycle feedbacks (such as the permafrost carbon 
feedback, Section 5.4.8, Box 5.1) have the potential to alter both the linearity and pathway independence of 
TCRE, if such feedbacks significantly contribute carbon to the atmosphere (MacDougall and Friedlingstein, 
2015) (Section 5.5.1.2.3, Section 5.4.8, Box 5.1). A recent study also shows how the value of TCRE can 
depend on the effect of ocean ventilation modulating ocean heat uptake (Katavouta et al., 2019). 
 
<boxref>Cross-Chapter Box 5.3</boxref> 
 
### 5.5.1.2  Assessment of Limits of the TCRE Concept  
 
#### 5.5.1.2.1  Sensitivity to amount of cumulative CO₂ emissions  
AR5 indicated that the concept of a constant ratio of cumulative emissions of CO₂ to temperature was 
applicable to scenarios with increasing cumulative CO₂ emissions up to 2000 PgC (Collins et al., 2013a). 
Recent analyses have added confidence to this insight (Herrington and Zickfeld, 2014; Steinacher and Joos, 
2016) and have also shown some evidence of a potentially larger window of constant TCRE (Leduc et al., 
2015; Tokarska et al., 2016). Using an analytical approach, MacDougall and Friedlingstein (2015) quantified 
a window of constant TCRE – defined as the range in cumulative emissions over which the TCRE remains 
within 95% of its maximum value – as between 360 to 1560 PgC. However, models with a more 
sophisticated ocean representation suggest that TCRE could also remain constant for considerably larger 
quantities of cumulative emissions, up to at least 3000 PgC (Leduc et al., 2015; Tokarska et al., 2016). 
Beyond this upper limit, studies are inconclusive with some suggesting that TCRE will decrease (Leduc et 
al., 2015) and others indicating that the linearity would hold up to as much as 5000 PgC (Tokarska et al., 
2016).  
 
As cumulative emissions increase, weakening land and ocean carbon sinks increase the airborne fraction of 
CO₂ emissions (see Section 5.4.5, Figure 5.25), but each unit increase in atmospheric CO₂ has a smaller 
effect on global temperature owing to the logarithmic relationship between CO₂ and its radiative forcing 
(Matthews et al., 2009; Etminan et al., 2016). At high values of cumulative emissions, some models simulate 
less warming per unit CO₂ emitted, suggesting that the saturation of CO₂ radiative forcing becomes more 
important than the effect of weakened carbon sinks (Herrington and Zickfeld, 2014; Leduc et al., 2015). The 
behaviour of carbon sinks at high emissions levels remains uncertain, as models used to assess the limits of 
the TCRE show a large spread in net land carbon balance (Section 5.4.5) and most estimates did not include 
the effect of permafrost carbon feedbacks (Sections 5.5.1.2.3, 5.4). The latter would tend to further increase 
the airborne fraction at high cumulative emissions levels, and could therefore extend the window of linearity 
to higher total amounts of emissions (MacDougall et al., 2015). Leduc et al. (2016) suggested further that a 
declining strength of snow and sea-ice feedbacks in a warmer world would also contribute to a smaller 
TCRE at high amounts of cumulative emissions. On the other hand, Tokarska et al. (2016) suggested that a 
large decrease in TCRE for high cumulative emissions is only associated with some EMICs; in the four 
ESMs analysed in their study, the TCRE remained approximately constant up to 5000 PgC, owing to 
stronger declines in the efficiency of ocean heat uptake in ESMs compared to EMICs.  
 
Overall, there is high agreement between multiple lines of evidence (robust evidence) resulting in high 
confidence that TCRE remains constant for the domain of increasing cumulative CO₂ emissions until at least 
1500 PgC, with medium confidence of it remaining constant up to 3000 PgC because of less agreement 
across available lines of evidence.  
 
 
#### 5.5.1.2.2  Sensitivity to the Rate of CO₂ Emissions 
Global average temperature increase responds over a timescale of about 10 years following the emission of a 
100 PgC pulse of CO₂ (Joos et al., 2013; Ricke and Caldeira, 2014), with larger emission pulses associated 
with longer timescales and smaller pulses with shorter ones (Joos et al., 2013; Matthews and Solomon, 2013; 
Zickfeld and Herrington, 2015). This behaviour is confirmed in other studies, including those that calculate 
the temperature response to an instantaneous doubling or quadrupling of atmospheric CO₂ (Matthews et al., 
2009; Gillett et al., 2013; Herrington and Zickfeld, 2014; Leduc et al., 2015; Hajima et al., 2020b). These 
findings suggest that the TCRE is sensitive to the rate of emissions, but studies assessing this sensitivity have 
found diverging results. For example, an increase in TCRE and its surrounding uncertainty was reported for 
experiments that imply a gradual decline in annual CO₂ emissions (Tachiiri et al., 2019). These studies 
suggest that in most cases TCRE would be expected to increase in scenarios with decreasing annual 
emissions rates. This increase in TCRE for annual CO₂ emissions declining towards zero can be the result of 
the zero emissions commitment (ZEC) which is the amount of warming projected to occur following a 
complete cessation of emissions (see Chapter 4, Section 4.7.2 for its assessment), as well as Earth system 
processes that are unrepresented in current TCRE estimates (Section 5.5.2.2.4) and other factors. When using 
TCRE to estimate CO₂ emissions consistent with a specific maximum warming level these factors have to be 
taken into account (see Figure 5.31). Combined with recent literature on the ZEC (MacDougall et al., 2020) 
and emissions pathways (Huppmann et al., 2018) and noting the lack of literature that disentangles these 
various contributions, there is medium evidence and high agreement resulting in medium confidence that 
TCRE remains a good predictor of CO₂-induced warming when applied in the context of emission reduction 
pathways, provided that ZEC and long-term Earth system feedbacks are adequately accounted for when 
emissions decline towards zero (see also next section).   
 
 
#### 5.5.1.2.3  Reversibility and Earth System Feedbacks  
There are relatively few studies that have assessed how the TCRE is expected to change in scenarios of 
declining emissions followed by net negative annual CO₂ emissions. Conceptually, the literature suggests 
that the small lag of about a decade between CO₂ emissions and temperature change (Ricke and Caldeira, 
2014; Zickfeld and Herrington, 2015) would result in more warming at a given amount of cumulative 
emissions in a scenario where that emission level is first exceeded and then returned to by deploying 
negative emissions (referred to as an “overshoot”, as is often the case in scenarios that aim to limit radiative 
forcing in 2100 to 2.6 or 1.9 W/m2 (Riahi et al., 2017; Rogelj et al., 2018a). Zickfeld et al. (2016) showed 
this to hold across a range of scenarios with positive emissions followed by negative emissions, whereby the 
TCRE increased by about 10% across the transition from positive to negative emissions as a result of the 
thermal and carbon inertia of the deep ocean. However, CMIP6 results for the SSP5–3.4-overshoot scenario 
show diverging trends across various ESMs (see Section 5.4.10, Figure 5.30). In an idealised CO₂-
concentration-driven setting Tachiiri et al. (2019) also reported an increase in TCRE. Exploring pathways 
with emissions rates and overshoots closer to mitigation pathways considered over the 21st century (in this 
case up to about 300 PgC), a recent emission-driven EMIC experiment showed pathway independence of 
TCRE (Tokarska et al., 2019b). Furthermore, also in absence of net negative emissions, warming would not 
necessarily remain perfectly constant on timescales of centuries and millennia, but could both decrease or 
increase (Frölicher and Paynter, 2015; Williams et al., 2017b; Hajima et al., 2020b). These additional 
changes in global mean temperature increase at various timescales are known as the ZEC (Jones et al., 2019; 
MacDougall et al., 2020), assessed in Section 4.7.2, and have to be integrated when using TCRE to estimate 
warming or remaining carbon budgets in overshoot scenarios.  
 
The AR5-assessed (Collins et al., 2013b) TCRE range was based in part on the ESMs available at the time, 
which did not include some potentially important Earth system feedbacks. Since then, a number of studies 
have assessed the importance of permafrost carbon feedbacks in particular on remaining carbon budgets 
(MacDougall et al., 2015; MacDougall and Friedlingstein, 2015; Burke et al., 2017; Gasser et al., 2018; 
Lowe and Bernie, 2018), a development highlighted and assessed in the IPCC Special Report on Global 
Warming of 1.5°C (Rogelj et al., 2018b). MacDougall and Friedlingstein (2015) reported a TCRE increase 
of about 15% when including permafrost carbon feedbacks. The overall linearity of the TCRE during the 
21st century was not affected, but they also found that permafrost carbon feedbacks caused an increase in 
TCRE on multi-century timescales under declining CO₂ emission rates. In addition, other processes that are 
not or only partially considered in individual or all ESMs could cause a further increase or decrease of TCRE 
(Matthews et al., 2020). These are discussed in detail in Section 5.4, but their quantitative effects on TCRE 
have not yet been explored by the literature.  
 
Whether TCRE remains an accurate predictor of CO₂-induced warming when annual CO₂ emissions reach 
zero and are followed by net carbon-dioxide removal (also referred to as TCRE reversibility) therefore 
hinges on contributions of slow components of the climate system that cause unrealised warming from past 
CO₂ emissions. Such slow components can arise from either physical climate (i.e., ocean heat uptake) or 
carbon cycle (i.e., ocean carbon uptake and permafrost carbon release) processes. The combined effect of 
these processes determines the magnitude and sign of the ZEC (MacDougall et al., 2020), which in turn 
impacts TCRE reversibility. As discussed in Section 4.7.2, recent model estimates of the ZEC suggest a 
range of ±0.19°C centred on zero (MacDougall et al., 2020). This suggests limited agreement among models 
as to the reversibility of the TCRE in response to net-negative CO₂ emissions. Furthermore, most models 
used for ZEC assessments to date do not represent permafrost carbon processes, although understanding their 
contribution is essential to isolate the TCRE contribution. There is therefore limited evidence that quantifies 
the impact of permafrost carbon feedbacks on the reversibility of TCRE, leading to low confidence that the 
TCRE remains an accurate predictor of temperature changes in scenarios of net-negative CO₂ emissions on 
timescales of more than a half a century. 
 
 
### 5.5.1.3  Estimates of TCRE 
 
IPCC AR5 (Collins et al., 2013a) assessed TCRE likely to fall in the range of 0.8–2.5°C per 1000 PgC (or 
per exagrams of carbon, EgC-1) for cumulative emissions up to 2000 PgC, based on multiple lines of 
evidence. These include estimates based on Earth system models of varying complexity (Matthews et al., 
2009; Gillett et al., 2013; Zickfeld et al., 2013), simple climate modelling approaches (Allen et al., 2009; 
Rogelj et al., 2012) or observational constraints and attributable warming (Gillett et al., 2013).  
 
Since IPCC AR5, new studies have further expanded the evidence base for estimating the value of TCRE. 
These studies rely on ESMs or EMICs, observational constraints and concepts of attributable warming, or 
theoretically derived equations (see Table 5.7 for an overview). Several studies have endeavoured to 
partition the uncertainty in the value of TCRE into constituent sources. For example, TCRE can be 
decomposed into terms of TCR and the airborne fraction of anthropogenic CO₂ emissions over time (Allen et 
al., 2009; Matthews et al., 2009). These two terms are assessed individually (see Section 5.4 and Chapter 7, 
respectively) and allow the integration of evidence assessed elsewhere in the report into the assessment of 
TCRE (Section 5.5.1.4). Further studies use a variety of methods including analysing CMIP5 (Williams et 
al., 2017c) or CMIP6 (Arora et al., 2020; Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020) output, conducting perturbed 
parameter experiments with a single model (MacDougall et al., 2017), Monte-Carlo methods applied to a 
simple climate model (Spafford and Macdougall, 2020), or observations and estimates of the contribution of 
CO₂ and non-CO₂ forcers (Matthews et al., 2021). All of the studies agree that uncertainty in climate 
sensitivity (either Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) or Transient Climate Response (TCR)) is amongst 
the most important contribution to uncertainty in TCRE, with uncertainty in the strength of the land carbon 
feedback and ocean heat uptake or ventilation having also been identified as crucial to uncertainty in TCRE 
(Matthews et al., 2009; Gillett et al., 2013; Ehlert et al., 2017; MacDougall et al., 2017; Williams et al., 
2017b, 2020; Katavouta et al., 2019; Arora et al., 2020; Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020; Spafford and 
Macdougall, 2020). Finally, internal variability has been shown to affect the maximum accuracy of TCRE 
estimates by ±0.1°C per 1000 PgC (5–95% range) (Tokarska et al., 2020).  
 
<tableref>5.7</tableref>

### 5.5.1.4  Combined assessment of TCRE 
 
Studies differ in how they define TCRE, in the methods they use, and their assumptions, such as the assumed 
climate sensitivity distribution or the choice of metrics of global temperature change (e.g. GMST or GSAT, 
see Table 5.7). This makes TCRE estimates from individual studies difficult to compare. The combined 
assessment of TCRE therefore takes advantage of the well-established decomposition of TCRE in two 
factors: the transient climate response (TCR) and the airborne fraction (Section 5.5.1.3). This provides a 
TCRE assessment range for CO₂-induced warming at the time of doubling CO₂ concentrations that builds on 
the broader Working Group 1 assessment. Expert judgment based on the airborne fraction range found in 
CMIP6 models (Arora et al., 2020; Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020) suggest a value of 53% with a 1-sigma 
range of ±6%, which is double the sigma range based on the spread of CMIP6 models only. Combining this 
range with the AR6 TCR assessment (Section 7.5, best estimate 1.8°C, 1.4–2.2°C likely and 1.2–2.4°C very 
likely range) results in a 5–95% range of 1.0–2.3°C per 1000 PgC. Based on expert judgment that accounts 
for the incomplete coverage of all Earth system components, this result in a consolidated assessment that 
TCRE would fall likely in the range of 1.0–2.3°C per 1000 PgC, with a best estimate of 1.65°C per 1000 
PgC. Warming here reflects the human-induced GSAT increase and assumes a normal distribution. Some 
studies using observational constraints support a lognormal shape for the TCRE distribution (Spafford and 
Macdougall, 2020), but such a distribution is currently not supported by the combined assessment of TCR 
and airborne fraction. Finally, this assessed TCRE range needs to be considered in combination with the 
ZEC (Section 4.7.2) when estimating the CO₂-induced warming of low-emissions scenarios.  
 
 
## 5.5.2 Remaining Carbon Budget Assessment 
 
Estimates of remaining carbon budgets consistent with holding global warming below a specific temperature 
threshold depend on a range of factors which are increasingly being studied and quantified. These factors 
include (i) well-understood methodological and definitional choices (Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; Rogelj et 
al., 2016, 2018b) (see Sections 5.5.2.1 and Section 5.5.2.2), and (ii) a set of contributing factors such as 
historical warming, the TCRE and its limitations, the ZEC (the amount of warming projected to occur 
following a complete cessation of emissions, see Section 4.7.2), as well as contributions of non-CO₂ climate 
forcers (Section 5.5.2.2) (Rogelj et al., 2015a, 2015b; MacDougall and Friedlingstein, 2015; Simmons and 
Matthews, 2016; MacDougall, 2016; Ehlert et al., 2017; Matthews et al., 2017, 2021; Millar et al., 2017a; 
Tokarska et al., 2018; Goodwin et al., 2018; Mengis et al., 2018; Pfleiderer et al., 2018; Cain et al., 2019). 
These contributing factors are integrated in an overarching assessment of remaining carbon budgets for 
limiting global average warming to levels ranging from 1.5°C to 2.5°C relative to pre-industrial levels 
provided in Section 5.5.2.3. Box 5.2 provides an overview of the methodological advances since AR5 
(Collins et al., 2013b).  
 
 
### 5.5.2.1  Framework and Earlier Approaches 
 
The IPCC AR6 Glossary (Annex VII) defines remaining carbon budgets as the maximum amount of 
cumulative net global anthropogenic CO₂ emissions expressed from a recent specified date that would result 
in limiting global warming to a given level with a given probability, taking into account the effect of other 
anthropogenic climate forcers, consistent with their assessment in the IPCC SR1.5 (Rogelj et al., 2018b). 
Studies, however, apply a variety of definitions that result in published remaining carbon budget estimates 
informing to cumulative emissions at the time when global-mean temperature increase would reach, exceed, 
avoid, or peak at a given warming level with a given probability, for example (Collins et al., 2013a; Stocker 
et al., 2013c; Clarke et al., 2014; Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; IPCC, 2014; Rogelj et al., 2016; Millar et al., 
2017a). This section provides an assessment of remaining carbon budgets consistent with the AR6 Glossary 
definition (Annex VII). Given that some feedbacks are time dependent, the values in this section apply to 
limiting warming over the 21st century, consistent with recent studies highlighting the usefulness of time-
limited carbon budgets (Sanderson, 2020). Irrespective of the exact definition of the remaining carbon 
budget, the finding that higher cumulative CO₂ emissions lead to higher temperatures implies that annual net 
CO₂ emissions have to decline to close to zero in order to halt global warming, whether at 1.5°C, 2°C or 
another level (Allen et al., 2018).  
 
Two approaches were used in AR5 to determine carbon budgets (Collins et al., 2013; Stocker et al., 2013; 
Clarke et al., 2014; IPCC, 2014; Rogelj et al., 2016). Working group I (WGI) reported threshold exceedance 
budgets (TEB) that correspond to the amount of cumulative CO₂ emissions at the time a specific temperature 
threshold is exceeded with a given probability in a particular greenhouse-gas and aerosol (pre-cursor) 
emission scenario (Collins et al., 2013a; IPCC, 2013b; Stocker et al., 2013c). WGI also reported TEBs for 
the hypothetical case that only CO₂ would be emitted by human activities (Collins et al., 2013a; IPCC, 
2013b; Stocker et al., 2013c). AR5 Working group III used threshold avoidance budgets (TAB) that 
correspond to the cumulative CO₂ emissions over a given time period of a subset of greenhouse-gas and 
aerosol (precursor) emission scenarios in which global-mean temperature increase stays below a specific 
temperature threshold with at least a given probability (Clarke et al., 2014). The AR5 synthesis report used 
TABs defined until the time of peak warming over the 21st century (IPCC, 2014). Drawbacks have been 
identified for both TEBs and TABs (Rogelj et al., 2016). TABs provide an estimate of the cumulative CO₂ 
emissions under pathways that have as a common characteristic that they do not exceed a specific global 
warming threshold. The actual level of maximum warming can however vary between pathways, leading to 
an unnecessary and poorly constrained spread in TAB estimates (Rogelj et al., 2016). The TAB approach 
does therefore typically not result in accurate projections of the remaining carbon budget. On the other hand, 
a drawback of TEBs is that they provide an estimate of the cumulative CO₂ emissions at the time global 
warming crosses a given threshold of interest in a specific emissions scenario, for example, most of the 
standard scenarios used in climate change research such as the RCPs or SSP-based scenarios exceed global 
warming of 1.5°C or 2°C (see Cross-Chapter Box 1.5) (Collins et al., 2013a; Stocker et al., 2013c; 
Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; Millar et al., 2017a). Because of potential variations in non-CO₂ warming at that 
point in time or potential lags of about a decade in CO₂ warming (Joos et al., 2013; Ricke and Caldeira, 
2014; Zickfeld and Herrington, 2015; Rogelj et al., 2015a, 2016, 2018) TEBs also do not provide a precise 
estimate of the remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to a specific level.  
 
Since the publication of AR5 (Collins et al., 2013b), several new approaches have been proposed that 
provide a solution to the identified limitations of TABs and TEBs. Most of these approaches indirectly rely 
on the concept of TCRE (Section 5.5.1), for example, because they estimate modelled cumulative CO₂ 
emissions until a temperature threshold is crossed and use this budget to infer insights for pathways which 
attempt to limit warming to below this threshold and thus need to follow a different path (Friedlingstein et 
al., 2014; Matthews et al., 2017; Millar et al., 2017; Goodwin et al., 2018; Tokarska and Gillett, 2018). In 
this report, the assessment framework of the IPCC SR1.5 for remaining carbon budgets is applied (Rogelj et 
al., 2018b, 2019). This framework allows to integrate multiple lines of evidence to assess the contributions of 
five components that together result in a consolidated assessment of the remaining carbon budget (historical 
warming, TCRE, non-CO₂ warming, the ZEC, and adjustments due to additional Earth system feedbacks, see 
Section 5.5.2.2). It builds on the advances in estimating remaining carbon budgets or related quantities that 
have been published since AR5 (Rogelj et al., 2015a; Haustein et al., 2017; Matthews et al., 2017, 2021; 
Millar et al., 2017a; Gasser et al., 2018; Lowe and Bernie, 2018; Tokarska et al., 2018; Nicholls et al., 2020). 
 
Recent studies suggest further changes to this framework by including non-linear adjustments to the TCRE 
contribution (Nicholls et al., 2020), or including non-CO₂ forcers in different ways by accounting for their 
different forcing effects (Matthews et al., 2021). Figure 5.31 provides a conceptual schematic of how the 
various individually assessed contributions are combined into a consolidated assessment of the remaining 
carbon budget. Together with estimates of historical CO₂ emissions to date (Section 5.2.1), these remaining 
carbon budgets provide the overall amount of cumulative CO₂ emissions consistent with limiting global 
warming to specific levels. A comparison with the approach applied in AR5 (Collins et al., 2013; Clarke et 
al., 2014) is available in the IPCC SR1.5 Section 2.2.2 (Rogelj et al., 2018b) as well as Box 5.2.   
 
<figref>5.31</figref>   
 
### 5.5.2.2  Assessment of Individual Components 

Remaining carbon budgets are assessed through the combination of five separate components (Forster et al., 
2018; Rogelj et al., 2018b). Each component is discussed and assessed separately in the sections below, 
based on all available lines of evidence. Box 5.1 details the differences compared to AR5 and SR1.5 
estimates (Collins et al., 2013b) (Rogelj et al., 2018b).  
  
 
#### 5.5.2.2.1  TCRE  
The first and central component for estimating remaining carbon budgets is the TCRE. Based on the 
assessment in Section 5.5.1.4, an assessed likely range for TCRE of 1.0–2.3°C per 1000 PgC with a normal 
distribution is used.  
 
 
#### 5.5.2.2.2  Historical Warming 
Advances in methods to estimate remaining carbon budgets have shown the importance of applying an as 
accurate as possible estimate of historical warming to date (Millar et al., 2017a; Tokarska and Gillett, 2018). 
This becomes particularly important when assessing remaining carbon budgets for global warming levels 
that are relatively close to present-day warming, such as a 1.5°C or 2°C levels (Rogelj et al., 2018b). Also 
the definition of global average temperature by which historical warming is estimated is shown to be 
important (see Cross-Chapter Box 2.3) (Cowtan and Way, 2014; Allen et al., 2018; Pfleiderer et al., 2018; 
Richardson et al., 2018; Tokarska et al., 2019a), as is the correct isolation of human-induced global warming 
(Haustein et al., 2017; Allen et al., 2018) to remove the effect of internal variability. Based on the assessment 
in Section 3.3 (Table 3.1), we here apply an assessed best-estimate historical warming estimate expressed in 
global average surface air temperatures (GSAT) of 1.07°C (0.8–1.3°C, likely range) between 1850–1900 and 
2010–2019. This choice implies global coverage and is consistent with AR5 where carbon budgets were 
reported in GSAT (Collins et al., 2013a; Stocker et al., 2013c), the SR1.5 where GSAT was the central 
metric for remaining carbon budgets (Rogelj et al., 2018b) and recent studies that highlight how GSAT 
enables an easy translation with AR5 (Tokarska et al., 2019a). The use of other historical reference periods 
(Cross-Chapter Box 1.2) or temperature metrics and updated data products (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3) can 
result in a different estimated historical warming and thus a changed remaining carbon budget.   
 
 
#### 5.5.2.2.3  Non-CO₂ Warming Contribution  
Non-CO₂ emissions contribute either cumulatively (N₂O, and other long-lived climate forcers) or in 
proportion to their annual emissions (CH₄ and other short-lived climate forcers) to global warming, and thus 
also affect estimates of remaining carbon budgets by reducing the amount of warming that could still result 
from CO₂ emissions (Meinshausen et al., 2009; Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; Knutti and Rogelj, 2015; Rogelj 
et al., 2015a, 2016, Williams et al., 2017c, 2016; Matthews et al., 2017; Collins et al., 2018; Mengis et al., 
2018; Tokarska et al., 2018; Zickfeld et al., 2021). The size of this contribution has been estimated both 
implicitly (Meinshausen et al., 2009; Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; Rogelj et al., 2016; Matthews et al., 2017; 
Mengis et al., 2018; Tokarska et al., 2018) and explicitly (Rogelj et al., 2015a, 2018b; Collins et al., 2018; 
Matthews et al., 2021) by varying the assumptions of non-CO₂ emissions and associated warming. Internally 
consistent evolutions of future CO₂ and non-CO₂ emissions allow to derive non-CO₂ warming contributions 
consistent with global CO₂ emissions reaching net zero levels and therewith capping maximum future CO₂ 
emissions (Smith and Mizrahi, 2013; Clarke et al., 2014; Huppmann et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018b; 
Matthews et al., 2021). Pathways that reflect such development typically show a stabilisation or decline in 
non-CO₂ radiative forcing and warming at and after the time of global CO₂ emissions reaching net zero 
levels, as illustrated in the scenario database underlying the IPCC SR1.5 (Huppmann et al., 2018; Rogelj et 
al., 2018b).  
 
The impact of non-CO₂ emissions on remaining carbon budgets is assessed with emulators (Meinshausen et 
al., 2009; Millar et al., 2017a; Gasser et al., 2018; Goodwin et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018b; Smith et al., 
2018a; Matthews et al., 2021) that incorporate synthesised climate and carbon-cycle knowledge (Cross-
Chapter Box 7.1). The estimated implied non-CO₂ warming can subsequently be applied to reduce the 
remaining allowable warming for estimating the remaining carbon budget (see Figure 5.31) (Rogelj et al., 
2018b, 2019). Alternative methods estimate the non-CO₂ fraction of total anthropogenic forcing (Matthews 
et al., 2021), or do not correct for non-CO₂ warming directly. The latter methods instead consider CO₂ and 
non-CO₂ warming together to define a CO₂ forcing equivalent carbon budget from which eventual non-CO₂ 
contributions expressed in CO₂-forcing-equivalent emissions have to be subtracted to obtain a remaining 
carbon budget (Jenkins et al., 2018; Matthews et al., 2020). These studies also use emulators to invert a 
specified evolution of non-CO₂ forcing to a corresponding amount of equivalent CO₂ emissions (Matthews et 
al., 2020), or alternatively use empirical relationships linking changes in non-CO₂ greenhouse gas emissions 
to warming (Cain et al., 2019). Methods to express non-CO₂ emissions in CO₂ equivalence are assessed in 
Section 7.6, yet their applicability and related uncertainties for remaining carbon budgets have not yet been 
covered in-depth in the literature.  
 
Application of the SR1.5 method (Forster et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018b) with AR6-calibrated emulators 
(Box 7.1) suggests a median additional non-CO₂ warming contribution at the time global CO₂ emissions 
reach net zero levels of about 0.1–0.2°C relative to 2010–2019. Uncertainty surrounding this range due to 
geophysical uncertainties such as non-CO₂ forcing uncertainties and TCR is of the order of ±0.1°C. 
Differences in the choices of mitigation strategies considered in low-emission scenarios (Huppmann et al., 
2018) result in a potential additional variation around the central range of at least ±0.1°C (spread across 
scenarios, referred to as non-CO₂ scenario uncertainty in Table 5.8).  
 
#### 5.5.2.2.4  Adjustments due to the Zero-Emission Commitment (ZEC)  
Use of TCRE for estimating remaining carbon budgets needs to consider the ZEC, the potential additional 
warming after a complete cessation of net CO₂ emissions. Based on the ZEC assessment presented in Section 
4.7.2, the ZEC’s central value is taken to be zero with a likely range of ±0.19°C, noting that it might either 
increase or decrease after half a century. ZEC uncertainty is assessed for a time frame of half a century, as 
this most appropriately reflects the time between the time stringent mitigation pathways reach net zero CO₂ 
emissions and the end of the century. For shorter time horizons, a similar central zero value applies, but with 
a smaller range (MacDougall et al., 2020). Experiments that ramped up and down emissions following a 
bell-shaped trajectory (MacDougall and Knutti, 2016a) show that when annual CO₂ emissions decline to 
zero at a pace consistent with those currently assumed in mitigation scenarios (Huppmann et al., 2018; 
Rogelj et al., 2018b), the ZEC will already be realised to a large degree at the time of reaching net zero CO₂ 
emissions (MacDougall et al., 2020).    
 
 
#### 5.5.2.2.5  Adjustments for Other not Represented Feedbacks  
Section 5.5.1.2 highlighted recent literature describing potential impacts of Earth system feedbacks that have 
typically not been included in standard ESMs (Schneider von Deimling et al., 2015; MacDougall and 
Friedlingstein, 2015; Schädel et al., 2016; Burke et al., 2017; Mahowald et al., 2017; Comyn-Platt et al., 
2018; Gasser et al., 2018; Lowe and Bernie, 2018), the most important of which is carbon release from 
thawing permafrost. The IPCC SR1.5 estimated unrepresented Earth system processes to result in a reduction 
of remaining carbon budgets of up to 100 GtCO₂ over the course of this century, and more thereafter (Rogelj 
et al., 2018b). Here this assessment is updated based on the Earth system feedback assessment of Section 
5.4.8 and synthesised in Figure 5.29 by applying the reverse method by (Gregory et al., 2009). 
 
The assessment in Section 5.4 and Box 5.1 highlights the different nature, magnitude and uncertainties 
surrounding additional Earth system feedback. The remaining carbon budgets reported in Table 5.8 account 
for these feedbacks, including corrections due to permafrost CO₂ and CH₄ feedbacks as well as those due to 
aerosol and atmospheric chemistry (Section 5.4.8). Two of these additional feedbacks (tropospheric ozone 
and methane lifetime feedbacks) are included in the projections of non-CO₂ warming carried out with AR6-
calibrated emulators (Box 7.1). The remainder of these independent Earth system feedbacks combine to a 
feedback of about 7 ± 27 PgC K-1 (1-sigma range, or 26 ± 97 GtCO₂ °C<sup>–1</sup>). Overall, Section 5.4.8 assessed 
there to be low confidence in the exact magnitude of these feedbacks and they represent identified additional 
amplifying factors that scale with additional warming and mostly increase the challenge of limiting global 
warming to or below specific temperature levels. 
 
### 5.5.2.3  Remaining Carbon Budget  
 
The combination of the five components assessed in Sections 5.5.2.2.1–5.5.2.2.5 allows for an overall 
assessment of the remaining carbon budget in line with different levels of global average warming, as 
documented in the IPCC SR1.5 (Rogelj et al., 2018b). The overall assessment of remaining carbon budgets 
(Table 5.8) reflects the uncertainty in TCRE quantification and provides estimates of the uncertainties 
surrounding the contributions of each of the respective further components. A formal combination of all 
uncertainties is not possible because they are not all independent or because they represent choices rather 
than probabilistic uncertainties (Matthews et al., 2021). In light of all uncertainties related to TCRE, non-
CO₂ forcing and response, the level of non-CO₂ mitigation, and historical warming, there is a small 
probability that the remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to 1.5°C since the 1850–1900 period is 
effectively zero. However, applying best estimate values for all but uncertainties in Earth system feedbacks 
and TCRE, the remaining carbon budgets in line with the Paris Agreement are generally small yet not zero 
(see Table 5.8).  
 
There is robust evidence supporting the concept of TCRE as well as high confidence in the range of 
historical human-induced warming. Combined with the assessed uncertainties in the Earth system’s response 
to non-CO₂ emissions and less well-established quantification of some of the effect of non-linear Earth 
system feedbacks, this leads to medium confidence being assigned to the assessed remaining carbon budget 
estimates while noting the identified and assessed uncertainties and potential variations. The reported values 
are applicable to warming and cumulative emissions over the 21st century. For climate stabilisation beyond 
the 21st century this confidence would decline to very low confidence due to uncertainties in Earth system 
feedbacks and the ZEC.  
 
For estimates of total carbon budgets in line with limiting global warming to a specific level, an estimate of 
historical CO₂ emissions should be added to the remaining carbon budget values reported in Table 5.8. 
Historical CO₂ emissions between 1850 and 2019 have been estimated at about 655 ± 65 PgC (1-sigma 
range, or 2390 ± 240 GtCO₂, see Table 5.1), while since 1 January 2015, an additional 57 PgC (210 GtCO₂) 
has been emitted until the end of 2019 (Friedlingstein et al., 2020).

# 5.6  Biogeochemical Implications of Carbon Dioxide Removal and Solar Radiation Modification 
 
## 5.6.1 Introduction
 
Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) refers to anthropogenic activities that seek to remove CO₂ from the 
atmosphere and durably store it in geological, terrestrial or ocean reservoirs, or in products (Glossary, Annex 
VII). CO₂ is removed from the atmosphere by enhancing biological or geochemical carbon sinks or by direct 
capture of CO₂ from air and storage. Solar radiation modification (SRM), on the other hand, refers to the 
intentional, planetary-scale modification of the Earth’s radiative budget with the aim of limiting global 
warming. Most proposed SRM methods involve reducing the amount of incoming solar radiation reaching 
the surface, but others also act on the longwave radiation budget by reducing optical thickness and cloud 
lifetime (Glossary, Annex VII). SRM does not fall within the IPCC definitions of mitigation and adaptation 
(Glossary, Annex VII). CDR and SRM are referred to as ‘geoengineering’ in some of the literature and are 
considered separately in this report. 
 
This section assesses the implications of CDR and SRM for biogeochemical cycles. CDR has received 
growing interest as an important mitigation option in emission scenarios consistent with meeting the Paris 
Agreement climate goals (SR1.5, SRCCL). The climate effects of CDR and SRM are assessed in Chapter 4, 
and a detailed assessment of the socio-economic dimensions of these options is presented in AR6 WGIII, 
Chapters 7 and 12. 
 
 
## 5.6.2  Biogeochemical Responses to Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) 
 
The scope of this section is to assess the general and methods-specific effects of CDR on the global carbon 
cycle and other biogeochemical cycles. The focus is on Earth system feedbacks that either amplify or reduce 
carbon sequestration potentials of specific CDR methods, and determine their effectiveness in reducing 
atmospheric CO₂ and mitigating climate change. Technical carbon sequestration potentials of CDR methods 
are assessed on a qualitative scale; a comprehensive quantitative assessment is left to the AR6 Working 
Group III report (Chapters 7 and 12). Biogeochemical and biophysical side effects of CDR methods are 
assessed here while the co-benefits and trade-offs for biodiversity, water and food production are briefly 
discussed for completeness, but a comprehensive assessment is left to WGII (Chapters 2 and 5) and WGIII 
(Chapters 7 and 12). The assessment in this chapter emphasises literature published since the AR5 WGI 
report (Chapter 6) for the assessment of the global carbon cycle response to CDR, and literature published 
since the IPCC SR1.5 (Chapter 4; IPCC, 2018), SRCCL (Chapter 6, IPCC, 2019) and SROCC (Bindoff et 
al., 2019) for the assessment of potentials and side effects of specific CDR methods. Emerging literature on 
deliberate methane removal is also briefly discussed. 
 
In this chapter, CDR methods are categorised by the carbon cycle processes that result in CO₂ removal: (i) 
enhanced net biological production and storage by land ecosystems, (ii) enhanced net biological production 
and storage in the open and coastal ocean, (iii) enhanced geochemical processes on land and in the ocean, 
and (iv) direct air capture and storage by chemical processes. A subset of CDR methods that restore or 
sustainably manage natural or modified ecosystems while providing human well-being and biodiversity 
benefits are also referred to as natural or nature-based solutions (see Glossary, Annex VII) (Griscom et al., 
2017, 2020; Fargione et al., 2018). CDR methods commonly discussed in the literature are summarised in 
Table 5.9. Other CDR options have been suggested, but there is insufficient literature for an assessment. 

These include ocean biomass burial, ocean downwelling, removal of CO₂ from seawater with storage, and 
cloud alkalinisation (Keller et al., 2018a; GESAMP, 2019).

### 5.6.2.1  Global Carbon Cycle Responses to CDR 
 
This subsection assesses evidence about the response of the global carbon cycle to CDR from idealised 
model simulations which assume that CO₂ is removed from the atmosphere directly and stored permanently 
in the geologic reservoir, which is analogous to direct air carbon capture with carbon storage (DACCS; 
Table 5.9). The carbon cycle response to specific land and ocean-based CDR methods is assessed in Section 
5.6.2.2.2. At the time of AR5 there were very few studies about the global carbon cycle response to CDR. 
Based on these studies and general understanding of the carbon cycle, AR5 WGI Chapter 6 assessed that it is 
virtually certain that deliberate removal of CO₂ from the atmosphere will be partially offset by outgassing of 
CO₂ from the ocean and land carbon sinks. Low confidence was placed on any quantification of effects. 
Since the WGI AR5 (Chapter 6), several studies have investigated the carbon cycle response to CDR in 
idealised “pulse” removal simulations, whereby a specified amount of CO₂ is removed instantly from the 
atmosphere, and scenario simulations with CO₂ emissions and removals following a plausible trajectory. In 
addition, a dedicated carbon dioxide removal model intercomparison project (CDRMIP) (Keller et al., 
2018b) was initiated, which includes a range of CDR experiments from idealised simulations to simulations 
of deployment of specific CDR methods (afforestation and ocean alkalinisation). 
 
This subsection assesses three aspects of the climate-carbon cycle response to CDR: the time-dependent 
behaviour of CO₂ fluxes in scenarios with CDR, the effectiveness of CDR in drawing down atmospheric CO₂ 
and cooling global mean temperature, and the symmetry of the climate-carbon cycle response to positive and 
negative CO₂ emissions. 
 
<boxref>Box 5.3</boxref>
 
#### 5.6.2.1.1  Carbon Cycle Response to Instantaneous CDR  
Idealised “pulse” removal Earth system model simulations are useful for understanding the carbon cycle 
response to CDR. Figure 5.32 illustrates the response of atmospheric CO₂, land and ocean carbon sinks to an 
instantaneous CO₂ removal applied from a pre-industrial equilibrium state. Following CO₂ removal from the 
atmosphere, the atmospheric CO₂ concentration declines rapidly at first and then rebounds (Figure 5.32 a). 
This rebound is due to CO₂ release by the terrestrial biosphere and the ocean in response to declining 
atmospheric CO₂ levels (Figure 5.32 b, c) (Collins et al., 2013a). For the model simulations shown in Figure 
5.32, 23 ± 6% (mean ± 1 standard deviation) of the 100 PgC removed remains out of the atmosphere 80–100 
years after the instantaneous removal. The remainder is offset by CO₂ outgassing from the land (49 ± 12%) 
and ocean (29 ± 7%). While the direction of the CO₂ flux is robust across models, the relative contribution of 
the outgassing from land and ocean reservoirs to the atmospheric CO₂ rebound after removal varies. These 
results corroborate the high confidence placed by WGI AR5 Chapter 6 on the partial compensation of CO₂ 
removal from the atmosphere by CO₂ outgassing from the land and ocean. Due to disagreement between 
models, the magnitude of this outgassing and in the relative contribution of land and ocean fluxes remains 
low confidence.  
 
<figref>5.32</figref> 

 
#### 5.6.2.1.2  Carbon Cycle Response Over Time in Scenarios with CDR  
Since WGI AR5 (Chapter 6), studies with ESMs have explored the land and ocean carbon sink response to 
scenarios with CO₂ emissions gradually declining during the 21st century. As CDR and other mitigation 
activities are ramped up, CO₂ emissions in these scenarios reach net zero and, as removals exceed emissions, 
become net negative. Studies exploring the carbon sink response to such scenarios (e.g. RCP2.6, SSP1–2.6) 
show that when net CO₂ emissions are positive, but start to decline, uptake of CO₂ by the land and ocean 
begins to weaken (compare land and ocean CO₂ fluxes in panels (a) and (b) of Figure 5.33) (Tokarska and 
Zickfeld, 2015; Jones et al., 2016b). During the first decades after CO₂ emissions become net negative, both 
the ocean and land carbon sinks continue to take up CO₂, albeit at a lower rate. For the land carbon sink, the 
sink-to-source transition occurs decades to a century after CO₂ emissions become net negative (Figure 
5.33c). The ocean remains a sink of CO₂ for centuries after emissions become net negative (Figure 5.33c-e; 
Section 5.4.9; Figure 5.30). Whether the transition to source occurs at all, the timing of the transition and the 
magnitude of the CO₂ source are determined by the magnitude of the removal and the rate and amount of net 
CO₂ emissions prior to emissions becoming net negative (medium confidence) (Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; 
Jones et al., 2016b). For scenarios with large amounts of CO₂ removal such as SSP5–3.4–overshoot the land 
source is larger than for SSP1–2.6 and the ocean also turns into a source (Section 5.4.10, Figure 5.30). While 
the qualitative response to scenarios with net-negative emissions is largely robust across models, the timing 
of the sink-to-source transition and the magnitude of the CO₂ source vary between models, particularly for 
the land sink. Due to limited agreement between models there is low confidence in the timing of the sink-to-
source transition and the magnitude of the CO₂ source in scenarios with net-negative CO₂ emissions. 
 
<figref>5.33</figref> 

 
#### 5.6.2.1.3  Removal Effectiveness of CDR  
It is well understood that land and ocean carbon fluxes are sensitive to the level of atmospheric CO₂ and 
climate change and differ under different future scenarios (Section 5.4). It is therefore important to establish 
to what extent the removal effectiveness of CDR – here defined as the fraction of total CO₂ removed 
remaining out of the atmosphere – is dependent on the scenario from which CDR is applied. Different 
metrics have been proposed to quantify the removal effectiveness of CDR (Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; 
Jones et al., 2016b; Zickfeld et al., 2016). One is the airborne fraction of cumulative CO₂ emissions (AF), 
defined in the same way as for positive emissions (i.e. as the fraction of total CO₂ emissions remaining in the 
atmosphere), with its use extended to periods of declining and net negative CO₂ emissions. This metric, 
however, has not proven to be useful to quantify the removal effectiveness of CDR in simulations where 
CDR is applied from a trajectory of increasing atmospheric CO₂ concentration, as it measures the carbon 
cycle response to CDR as well as to the prior atmospheric CO₂ trajectory (Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; 
Jones et al., 2016b). A more useful metric is the perturbation airborne fraction (PAF) (Jones et al., 2016b), 
which measures the airborne fraction of the perturbation (in this case the CO₂ removal) relative to a reference 
scenario (Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; Jones et al., 2016b). The advantage of this metric is that it isolates 
the response to a CO₂ removal from the response to atmospheric CO₂ prior to the point in time the removal is 
applied. A disadvantage is that the PAF cannot be calculated from a single model simulation but requires a 
reference simulation relative to which the effect of the CO₂ removal can be evaluated. When CDR is applied 
from an equilibrium state, the PAF and AF are equivalent measures. 
 
In scenario simulations and idealised simulations with instantaneous CO₂ removals applied from an 
equilibrium state, the removal effectiveness of CDR is found to be slightly dependent on the rate and amount 
of CDR (Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; Jones et al., 2016b; Zickfeld et al., 2021), and to be strongly 
dependent on the emission scenario from which CDR is applied (Jones et al., 2016b; Zickfeld et al., 2021). 
The fraction of CO₂ removed remaining out of the atmosphere decreases slightly for larger removals and 
decreases strongly when CDR is applied from a lower background atmospheric CO₂ concentration (Figure 
5.34), due to state dependencies and climate-carbon cycle feedbacks that lead to a stronger overall response 
to CO₂ removal (Zickfeld et al., 2021). Based on the high agreement between studies we assess with medium 
confidence that the removal effectiveness of CDR is only slightly dependent on the rate and magnitude of 
removal and is smaller at lower background atmospheric CO₂ concentrations. Simulations with Earth system 
models of EMIC with instantaneous CO₂ removal from different equilibrium initial states suggest that the 
smaller removal effectiveness of CDR at lower background CO₂ levels results in greater cooling per unit 
CO₂ removed (Zickfeld et al., 2021). However, there is low confidence in the robustness of this result as 
climate sensitivity has been shown to exhibit opposite state dependence in EMICs and ESMs (Section 
7.4.3.1). 
 
<figref>5.34</figref>  
 
#### 5.6.2.1.4  Symmetry of Carbon Cycle Response to Positive and Negative CO₂ Emissions  
It is commonly assumed that the climate-carbon cycle response to a negative CO₂ emission (i.e. removal 
from the atmosphere) is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the response to a positive CO₂ emission 
of equal magnitude, that is, symmetric. If the response were symmetric, a positive CO₂ emission could be 
offset by a negative emission. This subsection assesses the symmetry in the coupled climate-carbon cycle 
response in model simulations with positive and negative CO₂ emission pulses applied from a pre-industrial 
climate state. Simulations with seven CMIP6 ESMs and the UVic ESCM model of intermediate complexity 
suggest that the carbon cycle response is asymmetric for pulse emissions/removals of ±100 PgC (Figure 
5.35). For all models, the fraction of CO₂ remaining in the atmosphere after an emission is larger than the 
fraction of CO₂ remaining out of the atmosphere after a removal (by 4 ± 3%; mean ± standard deviation). In 
other words, an emission of CO₂ into the atmosphere is more effective at raising atmospheric CO₂ than an 
equivalent CO₂ removal is at lowering it. Sensitivity experiments with the UVic ESCM suggest that the 
asymmetry increases for larger amounts of emissions/removals and is insensitive to the background 
atmospheric CO₂ concentration from which the emissions/removals are applied (Figure 5.35). This 
asymmetry in the atmospheric CO₂ response originates from asymmetries in the land and ocean carbon 
fluxes due to nonlinearities in the carbon cycle response to CO₂ and temperature (Section 5.4) (Zickfeld et 
al., 2021). Given medium evidence and high agreement, there is medium confidence in the sign of the 
asymmetry of the carbon cycle response to positive and negative CO₂ emissions. The sign of the symmetry 
of the temperature response, on the other hand, differs between models, with three out of seven examined 
ESMs showing a smaller temperature response to a 100 PgC CO₂ emission than to an equivalent CO₂ 
removal. Therefore, there is low confidence in the sign of the asymmetry of the temperature response to 
positive and negative CO₂ emissions.

### 5.6.2.2  Effects of Specific CDR Methods on Biogeochemical Cycles and Climate  
 
WGI AR5 Chapter 6 discussed the CDR methods, their implications and unintended side effects on carbon 
cycle and climate, including their time scales and potentials. Since then, three IPCC special reports (SR) 
have been published. First, SR15 Chapter 4 (IPCC, 2018a) assessed the potentials and current understanding, 
including the side effects, of BECCS, afforestation/reforestation, soil carbon sequestration, biochar, 
enhanced weathering, ocean alkalinisation, DACCS and ocean fertilisation. Second, SRCCL Chapter 6 
(IPCC, 2019a) assessed the potentials, co-benefits and trade-offs of land-based mitigation options. It 
assessed with high confidence that land-based CDR options do not sequester carbon indefinitely, except for 
peatland restoration. Multiple co-benefits were identified in the deployment of CDR options, many of them 
with a potential to make positive contributions to sustainable development, enhancement of ecosystem 
functions and services and other societal goals. However, their potential was concluded to be context specific 
and limits to their contribution to global mitigation, such as competition for land, were identified. The third 
report, SROCC  Chapter 5 (IPCC, 2019b), assessed the potential of marine options for climate change 
mitigation. It concluded that the feasibility of open ocean fertilisation and alkalinisation approaches were 
negligible, due to their inconclusive influence on ocean carbon storage on long timescales, due to the 
unintended side effects on marine ecosystems, and the associated governance challenges. The assessment of 
the benefits of blue carbon ecosystems concluded that they could contribute only minimally to atmospheric 
CO₂ reduction globally but emphasised that the benefits of protection and restoration of coastal blue carbon 
extend beyond climate mitigation (SROCC Section 5.5.12). 
 
 
#### 5.6.2.2.1  Land-based Biological CDR Methods 
Biological CDR methods, introduced in Table 5.9, seek to increase carbon storage on land by enhancing net 
primary productivity and/or reducing CO₂ sources to the atmosphere.  
 
Forest-based methods include afforestation, reforestation, and forest management (Table 5.9). Building on 
previous work that emphasized the global potentials of various options, more recent advances have focused 
on the limits of those global potentials in light of ecological and climate risks that can threaten the long-term 
permanence of carbon stocks (Boysen et al., 2017b; Anderegg et al., 2020). Some of those risks arise from 
droughts, fires, insect outbreaks, diseases, erosion, and other disturbances (Thompson et al., 2009).  
 
Sustainable forest management can help to manage some of these vulnerabilities, while in some cases, it can 
increase and maintain forest sinks through harvest, transfer of carbon to wood products and their use to store 
carbon and substitute emissions-intensive construction materials (Churkina et al., 2020). Forest genomics 
techniques can increase the success of both reforestation and conservation initiatives, accelerating breeding 
for tree health and productivity (Isabel et al., 2020).  
 
In response to increasing risks to permanence of carbon stocks of some types of afforestation practices and 
the competition for land, there has been an increasing recognition that secondary forest regrowth and 
restoration of degraded forests and non-forest ecosystems can play a large role in carbon sequestration (high 
confidence). The rational for this focus builds on their high carbon stocks and rates of sequestration 
(Griscom et al., 2017; Lewis et al., 2019; Maxwell et al., 2019; Pugh et al., 2019b), high resilience to 
disturbances (Dymond et al., 2014; Messier et al., 2019), and more additional benefits such as enhanced 
biodiversity (Strassburg et al., 2020). 
 
The global sequestration potential of forestation varies substantially depending on the scenario-assumptions 
of available land and of background climate (WGIII AR6 Section 7.5). Afforestation of native grasslands, 
savannas, and open-canopy woodlands leads to the undesirable loss of unique natural ecosystems with rich 
biodiversity, carbon storage and other ecosystem services (Veldman et al., 2015; IBPES, 2018). 
Comprehensive approaches to assess the effectiveness of land-based carbon removal options need to be 
based on the whole carbon cycle covering both carbon stocks and flows, and establishing the links between 
human activities and their impacts on the biosphere and atmosphere (Keith et al., 2021). 
 
A range of mechanisms could enhance CO₂ sequestration of forest-based methods under future scenarios, 
including CO₂ fertilisation, soil carbon enrichment due to enhanced litter input, or the northward shift of the 
tree-line in future climate projection (Bathiany et al., 2010; Sonntag et al., 2015; Boysen et al., 2017; Harper 
et al., 2018). There is low confidence in the net direction of feedbacks of afforestation on global mean 
temperature. The feedbacks are highly region dependent. For instances, afforestation at high latitudes would 
decrease albedo and increase local warming, while at low latitudes, the cooling effect of enhanced 
evapotranspiration could exceed the warming effect due to albedo decrease (Pearson et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 
2013; Jia et al. 2019, SRCCL Section 2.6.1). Both afforestation and reforestation affect the hydrological 
cycle through increased VOC emissions and cloud albedo (Teuling et al., 2017; Kalliokoski et al., 2020), 
enhanced precipitation (Ellison et al., 2017) and increased transpiration, with potential effects on runoff and, 
especially in dry areas, on water supply (Farley et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2016; Krause et al., 2017; Teuling 
et al., 2019) (Figure 5.36, Cross-Chapter Box 5.1). Forest-based methods can either raise or lower N₂O 
emissions, depending on tree species, previous land use, soil type and climatic factors (low confidence) 
(Benanti et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2019; McDaniel et al., 2019) (Figure 5.36, Supplementary Materials, Table 
5.SM.4) . Afforestation will decrease biodiversity if native species are replaced by monocultures (high 
confidence), while there is medium confidence that biodiversity is improved when forests are introduced into 
land areas with degraded soils or intensive monocultures, or where native species are re-introduced into 
managed land (Hua et al., 2016; Williamson, P., & Bodle, 2016; Smith et al., 2018c; Holl and Brancalion, 
2020) (Figure 5.36, Supplementary Materials Table 5.SM.4). 
 
Soil carbon losses from human agriculture accounted for about 116 PgC in the last 12,000 years (Sanderman 
et al., 2017), (Section 5.2.1.2). With best management practices, two-thirds of these losses may be 
recoverable, setting a theoretical maximum of 77 PgC that can be sequestered in soils. Methods to increase 
soil carbon content may be applied to the restoration of marginal or degraded land (Paustian et al., 2016; 
Smith, 2016), but may also be used in traditional agricultural lands. A simple practice is to increase the input 
of carbon to the soil by selecting appropriate varieties or species with greater root mass (Kell, 2011) or 
higher yields and NPP (Burney et al., 2010). In addition, improved agricultural practices also increase soil 
carbon content. These include the use of crop rotation cycles, increase the amount of crop residues, use of 
crop cover to prevent periods of bare soil (Poeplau and Don, 2015; Griscom et al., 2017), optimisation of 
grazing (Henderson et al., 2015) and residue management (Wilhelm et al., 2004), use of irrigation (Campos 
et al., 2020), employment of low-tillage or no-tillage (Sun et al., 2020b), agroforestry, and cropland nutrient 
recycling, and avoid grassland conversion management (Paustian et al., 2016; Fargione et al., 2018). With 
medium confidence, methods which seek soil carbon sequestration will diminish N₂O emissions and nutrient 
leaching, and improve soil fertility and biological activity (Tonitto et al., 2006; Fornara et al., 2011; Paustian 
et al., 2016a; Smith et al., 2016; SRCCL 2.6.1.3, IPCC, 2019a; Figure 5.36). However, if improved soil 
carbon sequestration practices involve higher fertilisation rates, N₂O emissions would increase (Gu et al., 
2017). Some soil carbon sequestration methods, such as cover crops and crop diversity, can increase 
biodiversity (medium confidence) (Paustian et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2018).  
 
Biochar is produced by burning biomass at high temperatures under anoxic conditions (pyrolysis) and can, 
when added to soils, increase soil carbon stocks and fertility for decades to centuries (Woolf et al., 2010; 
Lehmann et al., 2015). Biochar application improves many soil qualities and increase crop yield (medium 
confidence) (Ye et al., 2020; SRCCL Chapter 4.9.5), particularly in already degraded or weathered soils 
(Woolf et al., 2010; Lorenz and Lal, 2014; Jeffery et al., 2016), increases soil water holding capacity 
(medium confidence) (Karhu et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2016; Fischer et al., 2019a; Verheijen et al., 2019) and 
evapotranspiration (low confidence) (Fischer et al., 2019). The use of biochar reduces nutrient losses (low 
confidence) (Woolf et al., 2010), enhances fertiliser nitrogen use efficiency and improves the bioavailability 
of phosphorus (Clough et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017b; Figure 5.36). Biochar addition may 
decrease CH₄ emissions in inundated and acid soils such as rice fields (low confidence) (Jeffery et al., 2016; 
Huang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019a; Yang et al., 2019a). In non-inundated, neutral soils CH₄ uptake from 
the atmosphere is suppressed after biochar application (low confidence) (Jeffery et al., 2016), and soil N₂O 
emissions decline (medium confidence) (Cayuela et al., 2014; Kammann et al., 2017). Potential risks of 
introducing harmful contaminants into the soil environment are not well understood (Lorenz and Lal, 2014). 
With low confidence, application of biochar can have co-benefits for soil microbial biodiversity (Smith et al., 
2018), while the potential trade-offs for biodiversity are due to land requirements (Tisserant and Cherubini, 
2019). 
 
Peatlands are less extensive than forests, croplands and grazing lands, yet per unit area, they hold high 
carbon stocks (Griscom et al., 2017). Peatland restoration relies on back-conversion or building of high-
carbon-density soils through flooding, that is rewetting (Leifeld et al., 2019). High water level and anoxic 
conditions are prerequisites for restoring by returning drained and/or degraded peatlands back to their natural 
state as CO₂ sinks, but restoration also results in enhanced CH₄ emissions which are similar or higher than 
the pre-drainage fluxes (high confidence) (Koskinen et al., 2016; Wilson et al., 2016a; Hemes et al., 2019; 
Renou-Wilson et al., 2019; Holl et al., 2020). In a multi-decadal timeframe, the reduction in CO₂ emissions 
from rewetting more than compensates for the initial increase in radiative forcing due to enhanced CH₄ 
emissions (Günther et al., 2020). Rewetting drained peatlands will decrease N₂O emissions (medium 
confidence) (Wilson et al., 2016b; Liu et al., 2020a; Tiemeyer et al., 2020). Restored wetlands and peatlands 
act as buffer zones that provide infiltration and nutrient retention and offer protection to water quality 
(Daneshvar et al., 2017; Lundin et al., 2017), particularly in nutrient-loaded agricultural catchments. 
Peatland restoration can also recover much of the original biodiversity (medium confidence) (Meli et al., 
2014; Smith et al. 2018). 
 
The concept of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) rests on the premise that bioenergy 
production is carbon neutral, that is as much CO₂ is sequestered when growing biomass as feedstock as is 
released by its combustion. If these emissions are also captured and stored, the net effect is removal of CO₂ 
from the atmosphere (Fuss et al., 2018). Sequestration potentials from BECCS depend strongly on the 
feedstock, climate, and management practices (Beringer et al., 2011; Kato & Yamagata, 2014; Heck et al., 
2016; Smith et al., 2016; Krause et al., 2017). If woody bioenergy plants replace marginal land, net carbon 
uptake increases, enriching soil carbon (Don et al., 2012; Heck et al., 2016; Boysen et al., 2017a,b). On the 
other hand, replacing carbon-rich ecosystems with herbaceous bioenergy plants could deplete soil-carbon 
stocks and reduce the additional sink capacity of standing forests (Don et al., 2012; Harper et al., 2018). 
Furthermore, wood-based BECCS may not be carbon negative in the first decades, initially emitting more 
CO₂ than sequestering (Sterman et al., 2018). BECCS has several trade-offs to deal with, including possible 
threats to water supply and soil nutrient deficiencies (medium confidence)  (Smith et al., 2016; Krause et al., 
2017; de Coninck et al., 2018; Heck et al., 2018; Roy et al., 2018) (SRCCL Chapters 2 and 6, Cross-Chapter 
Box 5.1). Deployment of BECCS at the scales envisioned by many 1.5–2.0°C mitigation scenarios could 
threaten biodiversity and require large land areas, competing with afforestation, reforestation and food 
security (Smith et al. 2018; Anderson and Peters 2016). Additional risks and side effects are related to 
geologic carbon storage (Fuss et al., 2018) (see also Section 5.6.2.2.4).  
 
In conclusion, land-based CDR methods that rely on enhanced net biological uptake and storage of carbon, 
have a wide range of biogeochemical and biophysical side effects, which can directly or indirectly strengthen 
or weaken the climate mitigation effect of a given method, or affect water quality and quantity, food supply 
and biodiversity (Figure 5.36). With the exception of a weakening of ocean carbon sequestration, there is low 
confidence in the Earth system feedbacks of these methods. Most methods are associated with a range of 
biogeochemical and biophysical side effects and co-benefits and trade-offs, but these are often highly 
dependent on local context, management regime, prior land use, and scale (high confidence). Highest co-
benefits are obtained with methods that seek to restore natural ecosystems and improve soil carbon 
sequestration (Figure 5.36) while highest trade-off possibilities (symmetry with the highest cobenefits) offs 
occurs for re/afforestation with monocultures and BECCS, again with strong dependence on scale and 
context (medium confidence). 
 
 
#### 5.6.2.2.2 Ocean-based Biological CDR Methods 
Both ocean biological and physical processes drive the CO₂ exchange between the ocean and atmosphere. 
However, the ocean physical processes that remove CO₂ from the atmosphere, such as large-scale 
circulation, cannot be feasibly altered, so ocean CDR methods focus on increasing the productivity of ocean 
ecosystems, and subsequent sequestration of carbon (GESAMP, 2019). There has been no change to the 
assessment of SROCC (Section 5.5.1): there is low confidence that nutrient addition to the open ocean, either 
through artificial ocean upwelling or iron fertilisation, could contribute to climate mitigation, due to its 
inconclusive effect on carbon sequestration and risks of adverse side effects on marine ecosystems (Figure 
5.36; Table 5.9; Supplementary Materials Text 5.SM.3; Supplementary Materials Table 5.SM.4; WGIII, 
Section 12.3; Gattuso et al., 2018; Boyd and Vivian, 2019; Feng et al., 2020). In addition, ocean fertilisation 
is currently prohibited by the London Protocol (Dixon et al., 2014; GESAMP, 2019). 
 
Restoration of vegetated coastal ecosystems (sometimes referred to as ‘blue carbon’ – see Glossary, Annex 
VII) refers to the potential for increasing carbon sequestration by plant growth and burial of organic carbon 
in the soil of coastal wetlands (including salt marshes and mangroves) and seagrass ecosystems. Wider usage 
of the term blue carbon occurs in the literature, for example including seaweeds (macroalgae), shelf sea 
sediments and open ocean carbon exchanges. However, such systems are less amenable to management, with 
many uncertainties relating to the permanence of their carbon stores (Windham-Myers et al., 2018; Lovelock 
and Duarte, 2019; SROCC Section 5.5.1.1). 
 
Coastal wetlands and seagrass meadows store significant amounts of carbon and are among the most 
productive ecosystems per unit area (Griscom et al., 2017, 2020; Ortega et al., 2019; Serrano et al., 2019). 
These rates could be reduced in the future, since these habitats are vulnerable to changing conditions, such as 
temperature, salinity, sediment supply, storm severity and continued coastal development (National 
Academies of Sciences and Medicine, 2019; Bindoff et al., 2019). These ecosystems are under threat from 
anthropogenic conversion and degradation and are being lost at rates between 0.7% and 7% per annum with 
consequent CO₂ emissions (e.g. Atwood et al., 2017; Howard et al., 2017; Hamilton and Friess, 2018; 
Sasmito et al., 2019). Although sea level rise might lead to greater carbon sequestration in coastal wetlands 
(Rogers et al., 2019), there is high confidence that the frequency and intensity of marine heatwaves will 
increase (Cross-Chapter Box 9.1; Frölicher and Laufkötter, 2018; Laufkötter et al., 2020),which poses a 
more immediate threat to the integrity of coastal carbon stocks (Smale et al., 2019). Blue carbon restoration 
seeks to increase the rate of carbon sequestration, although restoration may be challenging, because of on-
going use of coastal land for human settlement, conversion to agriculture and aquaculture, shoreline 
hardening and port development.  
 
Biogeochemical factors affecting reliable quantification of the climatic benefits of coastal vegetation include 
the variable production of CH₄ and N₂O by such ecosystems (Adams et al., 2012; Rosentreter et al., 2018; 
Keller, 2019), uncertainties regarding the provenance of the carbon that they accumulate (Macreadie et al., 
2019), and the release of CO₂ by biogenic carbonate formation in seagrass ecosystems (Kennedy et al., 
2018). Whilst coastal habitat restoration potentially provides significant mitigation of national emissions for 
some countries (Taillardat et al., 2018; Serrano et al., 2019), the global sequestration potential of blue carbon 
approaches is <0.02 PgC yr<sup>–1</sup> (medium confidence) (Figure 5.36; SROCC Section 5.5.1.2; Griscom et al., 
2017; Gattuso et al., 2018; National Academies of Sciences and Medicine, 2019).  
 
 
#### 5.6.2.2.3  Geochemical CDR Methods 
Enhanced weathering (EW) is based on naturally occurring weathering processes of silicate and carbonate 
rocks, removing CO₂ from the atmosphere. Weathering is accelerated by spreading ground rocks on soils, 
coasts or oceans. EW increases the alkalinity and pH of natural waters, helps dampen ocean acidification and 
increases ocean carbon uptake (Beerling et al., 2018). The dissolution of minerals stimulates biological 
productivity of croplands (Hartmann et al., 2013; Beerling et al., 2018), but can also liberate toxic trace 
metals (such as Ni, Cr, Cu) into soil or water bodies (Keller et al. 2018; Strefler et al. 2018). EW can also 
contribute to freshwater salinisation as a result of increased salt inputs and cation exchange in watersheds, 
and so adversely affecting drinking water quality (low confidence) (Kaushal et al., 2018). With a medium 
confidence, amendment of soils with minerals will have lower N₂O emissions (Blanc-Betes et al.; Kantola et 
al., 2017) but will not have a marked effect on evapotranspiration or albedo (Fuss et al., 2018; de Oliveira 
Garcia et al., 2020). The mining of minerals can cause adverse impacts on biodiversity, however the use of 
waste materials such as concrete demolition or steel slags for EW can reduce the need for mining (Renforth, 
2019). The spreading of minerals on land has a neutral impact on biodiversity (Smith et al. 2018)  
 
Ocean alkalinisation, via the deposition of alkaline minerals (e.g. olivine) or their dissociation products (e.g. 
quicklime) at the ocean surface, can increase surface total alkalinity and thus increase CO₂ uptake and 
storage (see Glossary, Annex VII; Supplementary Material Text 5.SM.3; WGIII Section 12.3; GESAMP 
2019; Keller 2019). Ocean alkalinisation ameliorates somewhat surface ocean acidification (high confidence; 
Hauck et al., 2016; Tran et al., 2020), there are also negative side effects on the marine ecosystem, most of 
which are poorly understood or quantified (Bach et al., 2019; Figure 5.36; Supplementary Materials Table 
5.SM.4). Although ocean alkalinisation could potentially sequester large amounts of carbon (≥1 PgC yr<sup>–1</sup>; 
Figure 5.36; Supplementary Materials Table 5.SM.5) there is no new evidence to revisit the SROCC (Section 
5.5.1.2.4) conclusion that there is low confidence that ocean alkalinisation is a viable climate mitigation 
approach. 
 
 
#### 5.6.2.2.4  Chemical CDR methods 
Direct air carbon capture with carbon storage (DACCS) is a combination of two techniques, direct capture of 
CO₂ from ambient air (DAC) and carbon storage. DAC entails contacting the air, capturing the CO₂ on a 
liquid solvent or solid sorbent, and regenerating the solvent or sorbent. Different DAC methods have been 
proposed, which differ by the chemical process used to capture the CO₂ and to recover it from the sorbent or 
solvent (NASEM, 2019). The captured CO₂ may be either stored geologically as a high-pressure gas or 
sequestered by a mineral carbonation process. Storage is potentially permanent in both pressurised gas and 
mineral form (Fuss et al., 2018). DACCS has significant requirements of energy and, depending on the type 
of technology, water and materials (Smith et al., 2016; NASEM, 2019). Compared to other CDR methods it 
has a small land footprint (Smith et al., 2016; NASEM, 2019). Side effects of DACCS include CO₂-depleted 
air leaving the air contactor, which could have adverse effects on crop and ecosystem productivity, and VOC 
emissions (NASEM, 2019). Additional risks and side effects are related to the high pressure at which CO₂ is 
stored in geologic formations (Fuss et al., 2018). DACCS is assessed in detail in WGIII Section 12.3. 
 
 
#### 5.6.2.2.5  Methane removal 
Proposals to remove CH₄ from the atmosphere are emerging (de Richter et al., 2017; Jackson et al., 2019). 
CH₄ removal methods seek to capture CH₄ directly from ambient air similarly to DACCS for CO₂ using for 
example zeolite trapping, but instead of storing it CH₄ would be chemically oxidized to CO₂ (Jackson et al., 
2019). Methane can be also removed microbially by supporting naturally occurring processes, for example 
by enhancing the soil microbial uptake through afforestation (Wu et al., 2018b) or by directing the venting 
air from a cow barn into the soil bed of a nearby greenhouse, utilising microbial CH₄ oxidation (Nisbet et al., 
2020). Microbial CH₄ oxidation could also be utilized for removal of CH₄ leaked from point sources by 
building biocatalytic polymers which include methane-oxidizing enzymes (Blanchette et al., 2016). Methane 
removal is, however, still in its infancy and the available literature is insufficient for an assessment.

## 5.6.3  Biogeochemical responses to Solar Radiation Modification (SRM) 
 
This section assesses the possible consequences of solar radiation modification (SRM) on the biosphere and 
global biogeochemical cycles. The SRM options (Table 4.6) and the physical climate response to SRM is 
assessed in detail in Chapter 4 (Section 4.6.3). Chapter 6 (Section 6.3.6) assesses the potential effective 
radiative forcing of aerosol-based SRM options and Chapter 8 (Section 8.6.3) assesses the abrupt water cycle 
changes in response to initiation or termination of SRM. Most literature on the biogeochemical responses to 
SRM focuses on stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), and only a few studies have investigated the 
biogeochemical responses to marine cloud brightening (MCB) and cirrus cloud thinning (CCT). At the time 
of AR5, there were only a few studies on the biogeochemical responses to SRM. The main assessment of 
AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013) was that SRM will not interfere with the direct biogeochemical effects of increased 
CO₂ such as ocean acidification and CO₂ fertilisation effect but could affect the carbon cycle through 
climate-carbon feedbacks. Overall, AR5 concluded that the level of confidence on the effects of SRM on 
carbon and other biogeochemical cycles is very low (Ciais et al., 2013). Since AR5, more modelling work 
has been conducted to examine various aspects of the global biogeochemical cycle responses to SRM.   
 
 
### 5.6.3.1  Effects of SRM on the Carbon Cycle   
 
Relative to a high-GHG world without SRM, SRM would affect the carbon cycles through changes in 
sunlight, climate (e.g. temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, ocean circulation), and atmospheric 
chemistry (e.g. ozone) (Cao, 2018) (Section 4.6.3.3). Net SRM effects on the carbon cycle, relative to a 
world without SRM, depend on the change of individual factors, and interactions among them.  
 
SRM-mediated sunlight changes directly affect the carbon cycle. In particular, SAI would reduce the 
sunlight reaching the Earth’s surface, but also increase the fraction of sunlight that is diffuse. These changes 
in the quantity and quality of the sunlight have opposing effects on the photosynthesis of land plants. On 
their own, reductions in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) will reduce photosynthesis. However, 
diffuse light is more effective than direct light in accessing the light-limited leaves within plant canopies, 
leading to the so-called ‘diffuse-radiation’ fertilisation effect (Mercado et al., 2009). The estimated balance 
between the negative impacts of reducing PAR and the positive impacts of increasing diffuse fraction differ 
between models (Kalidindi et al., 2015; Xia et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2020a) and across different ecosystems. 
The change in the absolute amount of direct and diffuse radiation could also depend on the height of the 
additional sulphate aerosol layer in the stratosphere and the hygroscopic growth of aerosols (Krishnamohan 
et al., 2019, 2020) .   
 
SRM-mediated cooling also affects the terrestrial carbon cycle. Relative to a high-GHG world without SRM, 
the simulated responses of net primary production (NPP) to SRM differ widely between models, such that 
even the sign of global mean change is uncertain (Glienke et al., 2015). SRM-induced cooling would 
decrease NPP at high latitudes by reducing the length of the growing season (Glienke et al., 2015). At low 
latitudes, the NPP response to SRM-induced cooling is sensitive to the effect of nitrogen limitation (Duan et 
al., 2020; Glienke et al., 2015; ). SRM-induced cooling tends to increase NPP in models without the nitrogen 
cycle because of reduced heat stress. However, in models including the nitrogen cycle, this is counteracted 
by reductions in NPP because of reductions in nitrogen mineralisation and nitrogen availability (Glienke et 
al., 2015). SRM-induced changes in the hydrological cycle (Section 8.6.3), including changes in 
evapotranspiration, precipitation, and soil moisture, also pose strong constraints on the vegetation response 
(Dagon and Schrag, 2019). For the same amount of global mean cooling, different SRM options, such as 
SAI, MCB, and CCT, would have different effects on GPP and NPP because of different spatial patterns of 
temperature available sunlight, and hydrological cycle changes (Section 4.6.3.3)  (Duan et al., 2020). 
Modelling studies show that SRM-induced cooling would reduce plant and soil respiration (Tjiputra et al., 
2016; Cao and Jiang, 2017; Muri et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2020b). Thus, despite the large uncertainty in 
modelled NPP response, existing modelling studies consistently show that relative to a high-CO₂ world 
without SRM, SRM would increase the global land carbon sink (high confidence).   
 
Based on available evidence, SRM with elevated CO₂ would increase global mean NPP and carbon storage 
on land, relative to an unperturbed climate mainly because of CO₂ fertilisation of photosynthesis (Glienke et 
al., 2015; Tjiputra et al., 2016; Dagon and Schrag, 2019; Duan et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020b) (high 
confidence). However, the amount of increase is uncertain as it depends on the extent to which CO₂ 
fertilisation of land plants is limited by nutrient availability. 
 
<figref>5.37</figref> 

Relative to a high-CO₂ world without SRM, SRM would also have compensating effects on crop yields. 
SRM is expected to have a positive impact on crop yields by diminishing heat stress (Pongratz et al., 2012). 
However, reductions in light availability will produce a counteracting reduction in crop yields, especially if 
the crop type does not benefit appreciably from diffuse-light fertilisation (Proctor et al., 2018). The balance 
between these effects varies markedly across crop types and regions, from projected increases in maize 
production in China (Xia et al., 2014) to reductions in groundnut yields in parts of India (Yang et al., 2016). 
Because of these diverging results from a limited set of studies, there is overall low confidence in the effect 
of SRM on crop yields. 
 
Consistent with the AR5 assessment, there is high confidence that SRM would not mitigate CO₂-induced 
ocean acidification (Ciais et al., 2013). Some studies even suggest an acceleration of deep-ocean 
acidification as a result of ocean circulation change (Tjiputra et al., 2016; Lauvset et al., 2017). There are 
large differences in the simulated spatial pattern of ocean NPP change in response to SRM, which depends 
strongly on the SRM method that is considered (Partanen et al., 2016; Lauvset et al., 2017). 

### 5.6.3.2  Consequences of SRM and its termination on atmospheric CO₂ burden 
 
Modelling studies consistently show that relative to a high-CO₂ world without SRM, SRM-induced cooling 
(Section 4.6.3.3) would reduce plant and soil respiration, and also reduce the negative effects of warming on 
ocean carbon uptake (Tjiputra et al., 2016; Xia et al., 2016; Cao and Jiang, 2017; Jiang et al., 2018; Muri et 
al., 2018; Sonntag et al., 2018; Plazzotta et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020b). A multi-model study (Plazzotta et 
al., 2019) indicates that relative to a high-CO₂ concentration world without SRM, statospheric SO2 injection 
increases the allowable CO₂ emission by enhancing CO₂ uptake by both land and ocean (Figure 5.37). As a 
result of enhanced global carbon uptake, SRM would reduce the burden of atmospheric CO₂ (high 
confidence). However, the amount of SRM-induced reduction in atmospheric CO₂ depends on the future 
emission scenario and modelled oceanic and terrestrial carbon sinks, which differ widely between models 
(Tjiputra et al., 2016; Xia et al., 2016; Cao and Jiang, 2017; Muri et al., 2018). Models that include the 
terrestrial nitrogen cycle usually report a much smaller reduction of atmospheric CO₂ in response to SRM 
than models without the nitrogen cycle mainly because nitrogen limitation leads to a weaker terrestrial 
carbon sink (Tjiputra et al., 2016; Muri et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2020b). Large scale application of SAI is 
found to reduce the rate of release of CO₂ and CH₄ from permafrost thaw (Lee et al., 2019; Chen et al., 
2020). 
 
A hypothetical, sudden and sustained termination of SRM would cause a rapid increase in global warming 
that poses great risks to biodiversity (Jones et al., 2013a; McCusker et al., 2014; Trisos et al., 2018) (Section 
4.6.3.3). A sudden and sustained termination of SRM would also weaken carbon sinks, accelerating 
atmospheric CO₂ accumulation and inducing further warming (Figure 5.37) (Matthews and Caldeira, 2007; 
Tjiputra et al., 2016; Muri et al., 2018; Plazzotta et al., 2019). However, a scenario with gradual phase-out of 
SRM under emission reduction could reduce the large negative effect of sudden SRM termination 
(MacMartin et al., 2014; Keith and MacMartin, 2015; Tilmes et al., 2016), though this would be limited by 
how rapidly emission reductions can be scaled-up (Ekholm and Korhonen, 2016). 
 
 
### 5.6.3.3  Consequences of SRM on other Biogeochemical Cycles 
 
SAI is found to reduce global average surface ozone concentration (Xia et al., 2017) mainly as a result of 
aerosol-induced reduction in stratospheric ozone at polar regions, resulting in reduced transport of ozone 
from the stratosphere (Pitari et al., 2014; Tilmes et al., 2018). The reduction in surface ozone, together with 
alteration to UV radiation, would have important implications for vegetation response (Xia et al., 2017). A  
modelling study shows that sea salt aerosol injection for MCB would reduce OH concentration and increase 
CH₄ lifetime, and hence, have potential implications for surface ozone pollution (Horowitz et al., 2020). It 
has also been reported that the use of SAI to limit global mean warming from 2°C to 1.5°C would reduce fire 
weather in many areas (Burton et al., 2018). 
 
 
### 5.6.3.4  Synthesis of biogeochemical responses to SRM  
 
SRM would alter the global carbon cycle through SRM-induced climate effect such as changes in sunlight, 
temperature, precipitation, and ocean circulation. Compared to high-CO₂ world without SRM, SRM would 
enhance the net uptake of CO₂ by the terrestrial biosphere and ocean, thus acting to reduce atmospheric CO₂ 
(high confidence). SRM would also affect surface ozone, UV radiation, and atmospheric chemistry. Due to 
complex interplays between SRM-induced changes in direct and diffuse sunlight, temperature, the coupling 
of water-carbon-nitrogen cycles, and atmospheric chemistry, there is large uncertainty in the overall response 
of the terrestrial biosphere response to SRM. Thus, the level of confidence on the effect of SRM on carbon 
and other biogeochemical cycles is low.  
 
 
# 5.7  Final Remarks 
  
Key research developments to further strengthen the confidence levels in AR7. 
 
## Contemporary Greenhouse Gases Trends and Attribution 

- Further constrain the CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O fluxes from land use, land use change and forestry 
(including gross fluxes), and fossil fuels. Improving spatial resolution and representations of land 
management, such as forestry, grazing and cropping. 
- Improve representation of the variability and trends in the transport of carbon through the land to 
ocean continuum, which has implications for partitioning of the land and ocean CO₂ sinks.  
- Improve understanding of the controls over the airborne franction and sinks rates, their trends, and 
future dynamics. 
- Fill gaps in space and time for ocean CO₂ and ancillary physical and biogeochemical observations at 
the ocean surface and interior to reduce the biases and uncertainties in the variability and trends for 
air-sea fluxes and inventory changes, particularly for the Arctic and the Southern Ocean.   
- Reduce uncertainties in wetland CH₄ emissions, which is largest source term in the global CH₄ 
budget and proportionally have the largest uncertainty, in order to better understand future CH₄-
climate feedbacks. 
- Reduce uncertainties in atmospheric transport models used to estimate regional sources and sinks of 
greenhouse gases as independent evidence from that of ground and inventory estimates. 

## Ocean Acidification and Deoxygenation 

- Improve observations for the interplay between carbonate chemistry and a variety of 
biogeochemical and physical processes including eutrophication and freshwater inflow in coastal 
zones to increase the robustness of future assessments of ocean acidification.  
- Improve our understanding of changes in water mass ventilation associated with climate change and 
variability to gain further insights into future trends in ocean acidification and deoxygenation in the 
ocean interior. 

## Biogeochemical Feedbacks on Climate Change 
- Improve understanding and representation in Earth system models (ESMs) of changes in land carbon 
storage and associated carbon-climate feedbacks including better treatment of the CO₂ fertilisation, 
nutrient-limitations, soil organic matter stabilisation and turnover; land use change; large-scale and 
fine-scale permafrost carbon; plant growth, mortality, and competition dynamics; plant hydraulics; 
and disturbance processes.  
- Improve observations and process understanding of CH₄ and N₂O source responses to climate, 
specifically from wetlands and permafrost thaw. 
- Improve observations and process understanding of ocean N₂O source responses to oxygen loss and 
climate particularly in the oxygen minimum zones of the tropical oceans and eastern boundary 
upwelling regions. 
- Improve understanding of the sensitivity of ocean carbon-climate feedbacks to physical processes 
that are not yet resolved by the ocean domain in ESMs. 
- Improve understanding of the processes affecting the efficiency, climate sensitivity and emerging 
feedbacks in the ocean carbon cycle via the biological carbon pump to constrain future global ocean 
feedbacks. 

## Remaining Carbon Budget to Climate Stabilisation 
- Improve understanding of both the sign and magnitude of a possible zero emissions commitment 
(ZEC). The ZEC affects estimates of carbon budgets derived from the TCRE, but not TCRE itself. 
ZEC is particularly relevant once global CO₂ emissions decline towards net zero. 
- Better constrain of the airborne fraction to reduce the spread in TCRE assessment.  
- Accounting for timescales of Earth system feedbacks over time for increased accuracy of mitigation 
needs once global CO₂ emissions reach near-zero levels.  

## Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) and Solar Radiation Modification  
- Run large-scale and long-term experiments and assessments to explore regional feasibility of CDR 
methods, that they present an actual and verifiable negative regional carbon balance, and that they do 
not result in adverse unintended consequences.  
- Improve understanding of the effectiveness of CDR methods to lower atmospheric CO₂ and reduce 
warming taking into account Earth system feedbacks.
