# <goto>11.es</goto> Executive Summary  
 
*This chapter assesses changes in weather and climate extremes on regional and global scales, including 
observed changes and their attribution, as well as projected changes.* The extremes considered include 
temperature extremes, heavy precipitation and pluvial floods, river floods, droughts, storms (including 
tropical cyclones), as well as compound events (multivariate and concurrent extremes). Changes in marine 
extremes are addressed in Chapter 9 and Cross-Chapter Box 9.1. Assessments of past changes and their 
drivers are from 1950 onward, unless indicated otherwise. Projections for changes in extremes are presented 
for different levels of global warming, supplemented with information for the conversion to emission 
scenario-based projections (Cross-Chapter Box 11.1; Chapter 4, Table 4.2). Since AR5, there have been 
important new developments and knowledge advances on changes in weather and climate extremes, in 
particular regarding human influence on individual extreme events, on changes in droughts, tropical 
cyclones, and compound events, and on projections at different global warming levels (1.5°C–4°C). These, 
together with new evidence at regional scales, provide a stronger basis and more regional information for the 
AR6 assessment on weather and climate extremes. 
 
*It is an established fact that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions have led to an increased 
frequency and/or intensity of some weather and climate extremes since pre-industrial time, in 
particular for temperature extremes.* Evidence of observed changes in extremes and their attribution to 
human influence (including greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions and land-use changes) has strengthened 
since AR5, in particular for extreme precipitation, droughts, tropical cyclones and compound extremes 
(including dry/hot events and fire weather). Some recent hot extreme events would have been extremely 
unlikely to occur without human influence on the climate system. {11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.6, 11.7, 11.8} 
 
*Regional changes in the intensity and frequency of climate extremes generally scale with global 
warming. New evidence strengthens the conclusion from SR1.5 that even relatively small incremental 
increases in global warming (+0.5°C) cause statistically significant changes in extremes on the global 
scale and for large regions (high confidence). In particular, this is the case for temperature extremes 
(very likely), the intensification of heavy precipitation (high confidence) including that associated with 
tropical cyclones (medium confidence), and the worsening of droughts in some regions (high 
confidence).* The occurrence of extreme events unprecedented in the observed record will increase with 
increasing global warming, even at 1.5°C of global warming. Projected percentage changes in frequency are 
higher for the rarer extreme events (high confidence). {11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.6, 11.9, CC-Box 11.1} 
 
## Methods and Data for Extremes 
 
*Since AR5, the confidence about past and future changes in weather and climate extremes has 
increased due to better physical understanding of processes, an increasing proportion of the scientific 
literature combining different lines of evidence, and improved accessibility to different types of climate 
models (high confidence). There have been improvements in some observation-based datasets, 
including reanalysis data (high confidence). Climate models can reproduce the sign of changes in 
temperature extremes observed globally and in most regions, although the magnitude of the trends 
may differ (high confidence).* Models are able to capture the large-scale spatial distribution of precipitation 
extremes over land (high confidence). The intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation simulated by 
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models are similar to those simulated by CMIP5 
models (high confidence). Higher horizontal model resolution improves the spatial representation of some 
extreme events (e.g., heavy precipitation events), in particular in regions with highly varying topography 
(high confidence). {11.2, 11.3, 11.4} 
 
## Temperature Extremes 
 
*The frequency and intensity of hot extremes have increased and those of cold extremes have decreased 
on the global scale since 1950 (virtually certain). This also applies at regional scale, with more than 
80% of AR6 regions1 showing similar changes assessed to be at least likely.* In a few regions, limited 
evidence (data or literature) prevents the reliable estimation of trends. {11.3, 11.9} 
 
*Human-induced greenhouse gas forcing is the main driver of the observed changes in hot and cold 
extremes on the global scale (virtually certain) and on most continents (very likely).* The effect of 
enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations on extreme temperatures is moderated or amplified at the regional 
scale by regional processes such as soil moisture or snow/ice-albedo feedbacks, by regional forcing from 
land use and land-cover changes, or aerosol concentrations, and decadal and multidecadal natural variability. 
Changes in anthropogenic aerosol concentrations have likely affected trends in hot extremes in some regions. 
Irrigation and crop expansion have attenuated increases in summer hot extremes in some regions, such as the 
U.S. Midwest (medium confidence). Urbanization has likely exacerbated changes in temperature extremes in 
cities, in particular for night-time extremes. {11.1, 11.2, 11.3} 
 
*The frequency and intensity of hot extremes will continue to increase and those of cold extremes will 
continue to decrease, at both global and continental scales and in nearly all inhabited regions1 with 
increasing global warming levels.* This will be the case even if global warming is stabilized at 1.5°C. 
Relative to present-day conditions, changes in the intensity of extremes would be at least double at 2°C, and 
quadruple at 3°C of global warming, compared to changes at 1.5°C of global warming. The number of hot 
days and hot nights and the length, frequency, and/or intensity of warm spells or heat waves will increase 
over most land areas (virtually certain). In most regions, future changes in the intensity of temperature 
extremes will very likely be proportional to changes in global warming, and up to 2–3 times larger (high 
confidence). The highest increase of temperature of hottest days is projected in some mid-latitude and semi-
arid regions, at about 1.5 time to twice the rate of global warming (high confidence). The highest increase of 
temperature of coldest days is projected in Arctic regions, at about three times the rate of global warming 
(high confidence). The frequency of hot temperature extreme events will very likely increase non-linearly 
with increasing global warming, with larger percentage increases for rarer events. {11.2, 11.3, 11.9; Table 
11.1; Figure 11.3} 
 
## Heavy Precipitation and Pluvial Floods  
 
*The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have likely increased at the global scale over 
a majority of land regions with good observational coverage. Heavy precipitation has likely increased 
on the continental scale over three continents: North America, Europe, and Asia.* Regional increases in 
the frequency and/or intensity of heavy precipitation have been observed with at least medium confidence for 
nearly half of AR6 regions, including WSAF, ESAF, WSB, SAS, ESB, REF, WCA, ECA, TIB, EAS, SEA, 
NAU, NEU, EEU, GIC, WCE, SES, CNA, and ENA. {11.4, 11.9} 
 
*Human influence, in particular greenhouse gas emissions, is likely the main driver of the observed 
global scale intensification of heavy precipitation in land regions.* It is likely that human-induced climate 
change has contributed to the observed intensification of heavy precipitation at the continental scale in North 
America, Europe and Asia. Evidence of a human influence on heavy precipitation has emerged in some 
regions. {11.4, 11.9, Table 11.1} 
 
*Heavy precipitation will generally become more frequent and more intense with additional global 
warming. At global warming levels of 4°C relative to the pre-industrial, very rare (e.g., 1 in 10 or more
years) heavy precipitation events would become more frequent and more intense than in the recent 
past, on the global scale (virtually certain) and in all continents and AR6 regions.* The increase in 
frequency and intensity is extremely likely for most continents and very likely for most AR6 regions. At 
the global scale, the intensification of heavy precipitation will follow the rate of increase in the maximum 
amount of moisture that the atmosphere can hold as it warms (high confidence), of about 7% per 1°C of 
global warming. The increase in the frequency of heavy precipitation events will accelerate with more 
warming and will be higher for rarer events (high confidence), with a likely doubling and tripling in the 
frequency of 10-year and 50-year events, respectively, compared to the recent past at 4°C of global warming. 
Increases in the intensity of extreme precipitation at regional scales will vary, depending on the amount of 
regional warming, changes in atmospheric circulation and storm dynamics (high confidence). {11.4, Box 
11.1} 
 
*The projected increase in the intensity of extreme precipitation translates to an increase in the 
frequency and magnitude of pluvial floods – surface water and flash floods – (high confidence), as 
pluvial flooding results from precipitation intensity exceeding the capacity of natural and artificial 
drainage systems.* {11.4} 
 
## River Floods 
 
*Significant trends in peak streamflow have been observed in some regions over the past decades* (high 
confidence). This includes increases in RAR, NSA, and parts of SES, NEU, ENA and   
decreases in NES, SAU, and parts of MED and EAS). The seasonality of river floods has changed in cold 
regions where snow-melt is involved, with an earlier occurrence of peak streamflow (high confidence). 
{11.5} 
 
*Global hydrological models project a larger fraction of land areas to be affected by an increase in 
river floods than by a decrease in river floods (medium confidence).* River floods are projected to become 
more frequent and intense in some AR6 regions (RAR, SEA, SAS, NWS) (high confidence) and less 
frequent and intense in others (WCE, EEU, MED) (high confidence). Regional changes in river floods are 
more uncertain than changes in pluvial floods because complex hydrological processes and forcings, 
including land cover change and human water management, are involved. {11.5} 
 
## Droughts  
 
*Different drought types exist, and they are associated with different impacts and respond differently to 
increasing greenhouse gas concentrations.* Precipitation deficits and changes in evapotranspiration (ET) 
govern net water availability. A lack of sufficient soil moisture, sometimes amplified by increased 
atmospheric evaporative demand (AED), results in agricultural and ecological drought. Lack of runoff and 
surface water result in hydrological drought. {11.6} 
 
*Human-induced climate change has contributed to decreases in water availability during the dry 
season over a predominant fraction of the land area due to evapotranspiration increases (medium 
confidence).* Increases in evapotranspiration have been driven by AED increases induced by increased 
temperature, decreased relative humidity and increased net radiation (high confidence). Trends in 
precipitation are not a main driver in affecting global-scale trends in drought (medium confidence), but have 
induced drying trends in a few AR6 regions (NES: high confidence; WAF, CAF, ESAF, SAM, SWS, SSA, 
SAS: medium confidence). Increasing trends in agricultural and ecological droughts have been observed on 
all continents (WAF, CAF, WSAF, ESAF, WCA, ECA, EAS, SAU, MED, WCE, WNA, NES: medium 
confidence), but decreases only in one AR6 region (NAU: medium confidence). Increasing trends in 
hydrological droughts have been observed in a few AR6 regions (MED: high confidence; WAF, EAS, SAU: 
medium confidence). Regional-scale attribution shows that human-induced climate change has contributed to 
increased agricultural and ecological droughts (MED, WNA), and increased hydrological drought (MED) in 
some regions (medium confidence). {11.6, 11.9} 
 
*The land area affected by increasing drought frequency and severity expands with increasing global 
warming (high confidence).* Several regions will be affected by more severe agricultural and ecological 
droughts even if global warming is stabilized in a range of 1.5°C-2°C of global warming (high confidence), 
including WCE, MED, EAU, SAU, SCA, NSA, SAM, SWS, SSA, NCA, CAN, WSAF, ESAF and MDG 
(medium confidence). At 4°C of global warming, about 50% of all inhabited AR6 regions would be affected 
(WCE, MED, CAU, EAU, SAU, WCA, EAS, SCA, CAR, NSA, NES, SAM, SWS, SSA, NCA, CAN, ENA, 
WNA, WSAF, ESAF, MDG; medium confidence or higher), and only two regions (NEAF, SAS) would 
experience decreases in agricultural and ecological drought (medium confidence). There is high confidence 
that the projected increases in agricultural and ecological droughts are strongly affected by ET increases 
associated with enhanced AED. Several regions are projected to be more strongly affected by hydrological 
droughts with increasing global warming (at 4°C of global warming: NEU, WCE, EEU, MED, SAU, WCA, 
SCA, NSA, SAM, SWS, SSA, WNA, WSAF, ESAF, MDG; medium confidence or higher). There is low 
confidence that effects of enhanced atmospheric CO2 concentrations on plant water-use efficiency alleviate 
extreme agricultural and ecological droughts in conditions characterized by limited soil moisture 
and enhanced AED. There is also low confidence that these effects will substantially reduce global plant 
transpiration and the severity of hydrological droughts. There is high confidence that the land carbon sink 
will become less efficient due to soil moisture limitations and associated drought conditions in some regions 
in higher-emission scenarios, in particular under global warming levels above 4°C. {11.6, 11.9, CC-Box 5.1} 
 
## Extreme Storms, Including Tropical Cyclones (TCs) 
 
*The average and maximum rain rates associated with TCs, extratropical cyclones and atmospheric 
rivers across the globe, and severe convective storms in some regions, increase in a warming world 
(high confidence).* Available event attribution studies of observed strong TCs provide medium confidence 
for a human contribution to extreme TC rainfall. Peak TC rain rates increase with local warming at least at 
the rate of mean water vapour increase over oceans (about 7% per 1°C of warming) and in some cases 
exceeding this rate due to increased low-level moisture convergence caused by increases in TC wind 
intensity (medium confidence).  {11.7, 11.4, Box 11.1} 
 
*It is likely that the global proportion of major TC (Category 3–5) intensities over the past four decades 
has increased.* The average location where TCs reach their peak wind intensity has very likely migrated 
poleward in the western North Pacific Ocean since the 1940s, and TC translation speed has likely slowed 
over the conterminous USA since 1900. Evidence of similar trends in other regions is not robust. The global 
frequency of TC rapid intensification events has likely increased over the past four decades. None of these 
changes can be explained by natural variability alone (medium confidence).  
 
*The proportion of intense TCs, average peak TC wind speeds, and peak wind speeds of the most 
intense TCs will increase on the global scale with increasing global warming (high confidence).* The 
total global frequency of TC formation will decrease or remain unchanged with increasing global warming 
(medium confidence). {11.7.1}  
 
*There is low confidence in past changes of maximum wind speeds and other measures of dynamical 
intensity of extratropical cyclones. Future wind speed changes are expected to be small, although 
poleward shifts in the storm tracks could lead to substantial changes in extreme wind speeds in some 
regions (medium confidence).* There is low confidence in past trends in characteristics of severe convective 
storms, such as hail and severe winds, beyond an increase in precipitation rates. The frequency of springtime 
severe convective storms is projected to increase in the USA, leading to a lengthening of the severe 
convective storm season (medium confidence); evidence in other regions is limited. {11.7.2, 11.7.3}. 
 
*Compound Events, Including Dry/Hot events, Fire Weather, Compound Flooding, and Concurrent 
Extremes* 
 
*The probability of compound events has likely increased in the past due to human-induced climate 
change and will likely continue to increase with further global warming.* Concurrent heat waves and 
droughts have become more frequent and this trend will continue with higher global warming (high 
confidence). Fire weather conditions (compound hot, dry and windy events) have become more probable in 
some regions (medium confidence) and there is high confidence that they will become more frequent in some 
regions at higher levels of global warming. The probability of compound flooding (storm surge, extreme 
rainfall and/or river flow) has increased in some locations, and will continue to increase due to both sea level 
rise and increases in heavy precipitation, including changes in precipitation intensity associated with TCs 
(high confidence). The land area affected by concurrent extremes has increased (high confidence). 
Concurrent extreme events at different locations, but possibly affecting similar sectors (e.g., critical crop-
producing areas for global food supply) in different regions, will become more frequent with increasing 
global warming, in particular above 2°C of global warming (high confidence). {11.8, Box 11.3, Box 11.4}.   
  
## Low-Likelihood High-Impact (LLHI) Events Associated With Climate Extremes 
 
*The future occurrence of LLHI events linked to climate extremes is generally associated with low 
confidence, but cannot be excluded, especially at global warming levels above 4°C.* Compound events, 
including concurrent extremes, are a factor increasing the probability of LLHI events (high confidence). 
With increasing global warming some compound events with low likelihood in past and current climate will 
become more frequent, and there is a higher chance of occurrence of historically unprecedented events and 
surprises (high confidence). However, even extreme events that do not have a particularly low probability in 
the present climate (at more than 1°C of global warming) can be perceived as surprises because of the pace 
of global warming (high confidence). {Box 11.2} 

# <goto>11.1</goto>  Framing 
 
## 11.1.1  Introduction to the chapter 
 
This chapter provides assessments of changes in weather and climate extremes (collectively referred to as 
extremes) framed in terms of the relevance to the Working Group II assessment. It assesses observed 
changes in extremes, their attribution to causes, and future projections, at three global warming levels: 1.5°C, 
2°C, 4°C. This chapter is also one of the four “regional chapters” of the WGI report (along with Chapters 10 
and 12 and the Atlas). Consequently, while it encompasses assessments of changes in extremes at global and 
continental scales to provide a large-scale context, it also addresses changes in extremes at regional scales.  
 
Extremes are climatic impact-drivers (Annex VII: Glossary, see Chapter 12 for a comprehensive 
assessment). The IPCC risk framework (Chapter 1) articulates clearly that the exposure and vulnerability to 
climatic impact-drivers, such as extremes, modulate the risk of adverse impacts of these drivers, and that 
adaptation that reduces exposure and vulnerability will increase resilience resulting in a reduction in impacts. 
Nonetheless, changes in extremes lead to changes in impacts not only as a direct consequence of changes in 
their magnitude and frequency, but also through their influence on exposure and resilience.  
 
The Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change 
Adaptation (referred as the SREX report, IPCC, 2012) provided a comprehensive assessment on changes in 
extremes and how exposure and vulnerability to extremes determine the impacts and likelihood of disasters. 
Chapter 3 of that report (Seneviratne et al., 2012, hereafter also referred to as SREX Ch3) assessed physical 
aspects of extremes, and laid a foundation for the follow-up IPCC assessments. Several chapters of the WGI 
AR5 (IPCC AR5; IPCC, 2013) addressed climate extremes with respect to observed changes (Hartmann et 
al., 2013), model evaluation (Flato et al., 2013), attribution (Bindoff et al., 2013), and projected long-term 
changes (Collins et al., 2013). Assessments were also provided in the recent IPCC Special Reports on 1.5°C 
global warming (SR15, IPCC, 2018; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018), on climate change and land (IPCC, 
2019), and on oceans and the cryosphere (IPCC, 2019). These assessments are the starting point of the 
present assessment.  
 
This chapter is structured as follows (Figure 11.1). This Section (11.1) provides the general framing and 
introduction to the chapter, highlighting key aspects that underlie the confidence and uncertainty in the 
assessment of changes in extremes, and introducing some main elements of the chapter. To provide readers a 
quick overview of past and future changes in extremes, a synthesis of global scale assessment for different 
types of extremes is included at the end of this Section (Tables 11.1 and 11.2). Section 11.2 introduces 
methodological aspects of research on climate extremes. Sections 11.3 to 11.7 assess past changes and their 
attribution to causes, and projected future changes in extremes, for different types of extremes, including 
temperature extremes, heavy precipitation and pluvial floods, river floods, droughts, and storms, in separate 
sections. Section 11.8 addresses compound events. Section 11.9 summarizes regional assessments of changes 
in temperature extremes, in precipitation extremes and in droughts by continents in tables. The chapter also 
includes several boxes and FAQs on more specific topics. 
 
<figref>11.1</figref> 
 
## 11.1.2  What are extreme events and how are their changes studied? 
 
Building on the SREX report and AR5, this Report defines an extreme weather event as “an event that is rare 
at a particular place and time of year” and an extreme climate event as “a pattern of extreme weather that 
persists for some time, such as a season” (Annex VII: Glossary). The definitions of rare are wide ranging, 
depending on applications. Some studies consider an event as an extreme if it is unprecedented; on the other 
hand, other studies consider events that occur several times a year as moderate extreme events. Rarity of an 
event with a fixed magnitude also changes under human-induced climate change, making events that are 
unprecedented so far rather probable under present conditions, but unique in the observational record – and 
thus often considered as “surprises” (see Box 11.2).  
 
Various approaches are used to define extremes. These are generally based on the determination of relative 
(e.g. 90th percentile) or absolute (e.g. 35°C for a hot day) thresholds above which conditions are considered 
extremes. Changes in extremes can be examined from two perspectives, either focusing on changes in 
frequency of given extremes, or on changes in their intensity. These considerations in the definition of 
extremes are further addressed in Section 11.2.1. 
 
 
## 11.1.3  Types of extremes assessed in this chapter 
 
The types of extremes assessed in this chapter include temperature extremes, heavy precipitation and pluvial 
floods, river floods, droughts, and storms. The drought assessment addresses meteorological droughts, 
agricultural and ecological droughts, and hydrological droughts (see Annex VII: Glossary). The storms 
assessment addresses tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones, and severe convective storms. In addition, 
this chapter also assesses changes in compound events, that is, multivariate or concurrent extreme events, 
because of their relevance to impacts as well as the emergence of new literature on the subject. Most of the 
considered extremes were also assessed in the SREX and AR5. Compound events were not assessed in depth 
in past IPCC reports (SREX Ch3; Section 11.8). Marine-related extremes such as marine heat waves and 
extreme sea level, are assessed in Chapter 9 (Section 9.6.4 and Box 9.2) of this report.  
 
Extremes and related phenomena are of various spatial and temporal scales. Tornadoes have a spatial scale 
as small as less than 100 meters and a temporal scale as short as a few minutes. In contrast, a drought can last 
for multiple years, affecting vast regions. The level of complexity of the involved processes differs from one 
type of extreme to another, affecting our capability to detect, attribute and project changes in weather and 
climate extremes. Temperature and precipitation extremes studied in the literature are often based on 
extremes derived from daily values. Studies of events on longer time scales for both temperature or 
precipitation, or on sub-daily extremes, are scarcer, which generally limits the assessment for such events. 
Nevertheless, extremes on time scales different from daily are assessed for temperature extremes and heavy 
precipitation, when possible (Sections 11.3, 11.4). Droughts, as well as tropical and extratropical cyclones, 
are assessed as phenomena in general, not limited by their extreme forms, because these phenomena are 
relevant to impacts (Sections 11.6, 11.7). Both precipitation and wind extremes associated with storms are 
considered.  
 
Multiple concomitant extremes can lead to stronger impacts than those resulting from the same extremes had 
they happened in isolation. For this reason, the occurrence of multiple extremes that are multivariate and/or 
concurrent and/or happening in succession, also called “compound events” (SREX Ch3), are assessed in this 
chapter based on emerging literature on this topic (Section 11.8). Box 11.2 also provides an assessment on 
low-likelihood high-impact scenarios associated with extremes. 
 
The assessment of projected future changes in extremes is presented as function of different global warming 
levels (Section 11.2.4 and CC-Box 11.1). On the one hand, this provides traceability and comparison to the 
SR15 assessment (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018, hereafter referred to as SR15 Ch3). On the other hand, this 
is useful for decision makers as actionable information, as much of the mitigation policy discussion and 
adaptation planning can be tied to the level of global warming. For example, regional changes in extremes, 
and thus their impacts, can be linked to global mitigation efforts. Additionally, there is also an advantage of 
separating uncertainty in future projections due to regional responses as function of global warming levels 
from other factors such as differences in global climate sensitivity and emission scenarios (CC-Box 11.1). 
However, information is also provided on the translation between information provided at global warming 
levels and for single emissions scenarios (CC-Box 11.1) to facilitate easier comparison with the AR5 
assessment and with some analyses provided in other chapters as function of emissions scenarios. 
 
A global-scale synthesis of this chapter’s assessments is provided in Section 11.1.7. In particular, Tables 
11.1 and 11.2 provide a synthesis for observed and attributed changes, and projected changes in extremes, 
respectively, at different global warming levels (1.5°C, 2°C, 4°C). Tables on regional-scale assessments for 
changes in temperature extremes, heavy precipitation and droughts, are provided in Section 11.9. 
 
## 11.1.4  Effects of greenhouse gas and other external forcings on extremes 
 
SREX, AR5, and SR15 assessed that there is evidence from observations that some extremes have changed 
since the mid 20th century, that some of the changes are a result of anthropogenic influences, and that some 
observed changes are projected to continue into the future, while other changes are projected to emerge from 
natural climate variability under enhanced global warming (SREX Chapter 3, AR5 Chapter 10).  
 
At the global scale but also at the regional scale to some extent, many of the changes in extremes are a direct 
consequence of enhanced radiative forcing, and the associated global warming and/or resultant increase in 
the water-holding capacity of the atmosphere, as well as changes in vertical stability and meridional 
temperature gradients that affect climate dynamics (see Box 11.1). Widespread observed and projected 
increases in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes, together with decreases in the intensity and 
frequency of cold extremes, are consistent with global and regional warming (Figure 11.2, Section 11.3). 
Extreme temperatures on land tend to increase more than the global mean temperature (Figure 11.2), due in 
large part to the land-sea contrast, and additionally to regional feedbacks in some regions (Section 11.1.6). 
Increases in the intensity of temperature extremes scale robustly and in general linearly with global warming 
across different geographical regions in projections up to 2100, with minimal dependence on emissions 
scenarios (Figures 11.3 and 11.A.1; Seneviratne et al., 2016; Wartenburger et al., 2017; Kharin et al., 2018; 
Section 11.2.4 and CC-Box 11.1). The frequency of hot temperature extremes (see Figure 11.6), the number 
of heat wave days and the length of heat wave seasons in various regions also scale well, but non-linearly 
(because of the threshold effect), with global mean temperatures (Wartenburger et al., 2017; Sun et al., 
2018a).  
 
Changes in annual maximum one-day precipitation (Rx1day) are proportional to mean global surface 
temperature changes, at about 7% increase per 1°C temperature increase, that is, following the Clausius-
Clapeyron relationship (Box 11.1), both in observations (Westra et al., 2013) and in future projections 
(Kharin et al., 2013) at the global scale. Extreme short-duration precipitation in North America also scales 
with global surface temperature (Li et al., 2018a; Prein et al., 2016b). At the local and regional scales, 
changes in extremes are also strongly modulated and controlled by regional forcings and feedback 
mechanisms (Section 11.1.6), whereby some regional forcings, for example, associated with changes in land 
cover and land or aerosol emissions, can have non-local or some (non-homogeneous) global-scale effects. In 
general, there is high confidence in changes in extremes due to global-scale thermodynamic processes (i.e., 
global warming, mean moistening of the air) as the processes are well understood, while the confidence in 
those related to dynamic processes or regional and local forcing, including regional and local thermodynamic 
processes, is much lower due to multiple factors (see following sub-section and Box 11.1).   
 
<figref>11.2</figref> 
 
<figref>11.3</figref> 
 
Since AR5, the attribution of extreme weather events, or the investigation of changes in the frequency and/or 
magnitude of individual and local- and regional-scale extreme weather events due to various drivers (see 
Cross-Working Group Box 1.1 (in Chapter 1) and Section 11.2.3) has provided evidence that greenhouse 
gases and other external forcings have affected individual extreme weather events. The events that have been 
studied are geographically uneven. A few events, for example, extreme rainfall events in the UK (Schaller et 
al., 2016; Vautard et al., 2016; Otto et al., 2018b) or heat waves in Australia (King et al., 2014; Perkins-
Kirkpatrick et al., 2016; Lewis et al., 2017b), have spurred more studies than other events. Many highly 
impactful extreme weather events have not been studied in the event attribution framework. Studies in the 
developing world are also generally lacking. This is due to various reasons (Section 11.2) including lack of 
observational data, lack of reliable climate models, and lack of scientific capacity (Otto et al., 2020). While 
the events that have been studied are not representative of all extreme events that occurred and results from 
these studies may also be subject to selection bias, the large number of event attribution studies provide 
evidence that changes in the properties of these local and individual events are in line with expected 
consequences of human influence on the climate and can be attributed to external drivers (Section 11.9). 
Figure 11.4 summarizes assessments of observed changes in temperature extremes, in heavy precipitation 
and in droughts, and their attribution in a map form.

## 11.1.5  Effects of large-scale circulation on changes in extremes 
 
Atmospheric large-scale circulation patterns and associated atmospheric dynamics are important 
determinants of the regional climate (Chapter 10). As a result, they are also important to the magnitude, 
frequency, and duration of extremes (Box 11.4). Aspects of changes in large-scale circulation patterns are 
assessed in Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 8 and representative atmospheric and oceanic modes are described in Annex 
IV. This subsection provides some general concepts, through a couple of examples, on why the uncertainty 
in the response of large-scale circulation patterns to external forcing can cascade to uncertainty in the 
response of extremes to external forcings. Details for specific types of extremes are covered in the relevant 
subsections. For example, the occurrence of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences 
precipitation regimes in many areas, favoring droughts in some regions and heavy rains in others (Box 11.4). 
The extent and strength of the Hadley circulation influences regions where tropical and extra-tropical 
cyclones occur, with important consequences for the characteristics of extreme precipitation, drought, and 
winds (Section 11.7). Changes in circulation patterns associated with land-ocean heat contrast, which affect 
the monsoon circulations (Section 8.4.2.4), lead to heavy precipitation along the coastal regions in East Asia 
(Freychet et al., 2015). As a result, changes in the spatial and/or temporal variability of the atmospheric 
circulation in response to warming affect characteristics of weather systems such as tropical cyclones 
(Sharmila and Walsh, 2018), storm tracks (Shaw et al., 2016), and atmospheric rivers (Waliser and Guan, 
2017) (e.g. Section 11.7). Changes in weather systems come with changes in the frequency and intensity of 
extreme winds, extreme temperatures, and extreme precipitation, on the backdrop of thermodynamic 
responses of extremes to warming (Box 11.1). Floods are also affected by large-scale circulation modes, 
including ENSO, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (AMV), and 
the Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV) (Kundzewicz et al., 2018; Annex IV). Aerosol forcing, through 
changes in patterns of sea surface temperatures (SSTs), also affects circulation patterns and tropical cyclone 
activities (Takahashi et al., 2017). 
 
Changes in atmospheric large-scale circulation due to external forcing are uncertain in general, but there are 
clear signals in some aspects (Chapter 2, 3, 4, and 8; Sections 2.3.1.4, 8.2.2.2). Among them, there has been 
a very likely widening of the Hadley circulation since the 1980s and the extratropical jets and cyclone tracks 
have likely been shifting poleward since the 1980s (Section 2.3.1.4). The poleward expansion affects drought 
occurrence in some regions (Section 11.6), and results in poleward shifts of tropical cyclones and storm 
tracks (Sections 11.7.1, 11.7.2). Although it is very likely that the amplitude of ENSO variability will not 
robustly change over the 21st century (Section 4.3.3.2), the frequency of extreme El Niños (Box 11.4), 
defined by precipitation threshold, is projected to increase with global warming (Section 6.5 of SROCC). 
This would have implications for projected changes in extreme events affected by ENSO, including droughts 
over wide areas (Section 11.6; Box 11.4) and tropical cyclones (Section 11.7.1). A case study is provided for 
extreme ENSOs in 2015/2016 in Box 11.4 to highlight the influence of ENSO on extremes.  
 
In summary, large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns are important drivers for local and regional 
extremes. There is overall low confidence about future changes in the magnitude, frequency, and spatial 
distribution of these patterns, which contributes to uncertainty in projected responses of extremes, especially 
in the near term.   
 
 
## 11.1.6  Effects of regional-scale processes and forcings and feedbacks on changes in extremes 
 
At the local and regional scales, changes in extremes are strongly modulated by regional and local feedbacks 
(SRCCL, Jia et al., 2019; Seneviratne et al., 2013; Miralles et al., 2014; Lorenz et al., 2016; Vogel et al., 
2017), changes in large-scale circulation patterns (11.1.5), and regional forcings such as changes in land use 
or aerosol concentrations (Chapters 3 and 7; Hirsch et al., 2017, 2018; Thiery et al., 2017; Wang et al., 
2017f; Findell et al., 2017). In some cases, such responses may also include non-local effects (e.g., Persad 
and Caldeira, 2018; Miralles et al., 2019; de Vrese et al., 2016; Schumacher et al., 2019). Regional-scale 
forcing and feedbacks often affect temperature distributions asymmetrically, with generally higher effects for 
the hottest percentiles (Section 11.3).  
 
Land use can affect regional extremes, in particular hot extremes, in several ways (high confidence). This 
includes effects of land management (e.g. cropland intensification, irrigation, double cropping) and well as 
of land cover changes (deforestation) (Section 11.3.2; see also 11.6). Some of these processes are not well 
represented (e.g. effects of forest cover on diurnal temperature cycle) or not integrated (e.g. irrigation) in 
climate models (Sections 11.3.2, 11.3.3). Overall, the effects of land use forcing may be particularly relevant 
in the context of low-emissions scenarios, which include large land use modifications, for instance associated 
with the expansion of biofuels, biofuels with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), or re-afforestation to 
ensure negative emissions, as well as with the expansion of food production (e.g. SR15, Chapter 3; CC-Box 
5.1; van Vuuren et al., 2011, Hirsch et al., 2018). There are also effects on the water cycle through 
freshwater use (CC-Box 5.1; Section 11.6). 
 
Aerosol forcing also has a strong regional footprint associated with regional emissions, which affects 
temperature and precipitation extremes (high confidence; Sections 11.3, 11.4). From ca. the 1950s to 1980s, 
enhanced aerosol loadings led to regional cooling due to decreased global solar radiation (“global dimming”) 
which was followed by a phase of “global brightening” due to a reduction in aerosol loadings (Chapters 3 
and 7; Wild et al., 2005). King et al. (2016a) show that aerosol-induced cooling delayed the timing of a 
significant human contribution to record-breaking heat extremes in some regions. On the other hand, the 
decreased aerosol loading since the 1990s has led to an accelerated warming of hot extremes in some 
regions. Based on Earth System Model (ESM) simulations, Dong et al. (2017b) suggest that a substantial 
fraction of the warming of the annual hottest days in Western Europe since the mid-1990s has been due to 
decreases in aerosol concentrations in the region. Dong et al. (2016) also identify non-local effects of 
decreases in aerosol concentrations in Western Europe, which they estimate played a dominant role in the 
warming of the hottest daytime temperatures in Northeast Asia since the mid-1990s, via induced coupled 
atmosphere-land surface and cloud feedbacks, rather than a direct impact of anthropogenic aerosol changes 
on cloud condensation nuclei.  
 
In addition to regional forcings, regional feedback mechanisms can also substantially affect extremes (high 
confidence; Sections 11.3, 11.4, 11.6). In particular, soil moisture feedbacks play an important role for 
extremes in several mid-latitude regions, leading in particular to a marked additional warming of hot 
extremes compared to mean global warming (Seneviratne et al., 2016; Bathiany et al., 2018; Miralles et al., 
2019), which is superimposed on the known land-sea contrast in mean warming (Vogel et al., 2017). Soil 
moisture-atmosphere feedbacks also affect drought development (Section 11.6). Additionally, effects of land 
surface conditions on circulation patterns have also been reported (Koster et al., 2016; Sato and Nakamura, 
2019). These regional feedbacks are also associated with substantial spread in models (Section 11.3), and 
contribute to the identified higher spread of regional projections of temperature extremes as function of 
global warming, compared with the spread resulting from the differences in projected global warming 
(global transient climate responses) in climate models (Seneviratne and Hauser, 2020). In addition, there are 
also feedbacks between soil moisture content and precipitation occurrence, generally characterized by 
negative spatial feedbacks and positive local feedbacks (Taylor et al., 2012; Guillod et al., 2015). Climate 
model projections suggest that these feedbacks are relevant for projected changes in heavy precipitation 
(Seneviratne et al., 2013), however, there is evidence that climate models do not capture the correct sign of 
the soil moisture-precipitation feedbacks in several regions, in particular spatially and/or in some cases also 
temporally (Taylor et al., 2012; Moon et al., 2019). In the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes, the snow- and 
ice-albedo feedback, along with other factors, is projected to largely amplify temperature increases (e.g., 
Pithan and Mauritsen, 2014), although the effect on temperature extremes is still unclear. It is also still 
unclear whether snow-albedo feedbacks in mountainous regions might have an effect on temperature and 
precipitation extremes (e.g. Gobiet et al., 2014), however these feedbacks play an important role in projected 
changes in high-latitude warming (Hall and Qu, 2006), and, in particular, in changes in cold extremes in 
these regions (Section 11.3). 
 
Finally, extreme events may also regionally amplify one another. This is, e.g., the case for heat waves and 
droughts, with high temperatures and stronger radiative forcing leading to drying tendencies on land due to 
increased evapotranspiration (Section 11.6), and drier soils then inducing decreased evapotranspiration and 
higher sensible heat flux and hot temperatures (Seneviratne et al., 2013; Miralles et al., 2014; Vogel et al., 
2017; Zscheischler and Seneviratne, 2017; Zhou et al., 2019b; Kong et al., 2020; see Box 11.1, Section 
11.8).  
 
In summary, regional forcings and feedbacks, in particular associated with land use and aerosol forcings, and 
soil moisture-temperature, soil moisture-precipitation, and snow/ice-albedo-temperature feedbacks, play an 
important role in modulating regional changes in extremes. These can also lead to a higher warming of 
extreme temperatures compared to mean temperature (high confidence), and possibly cooling in some 
regions (medium confidence). However, there is only medium confidence in the representation of the 
associated processes in state-of-the-art Earth System Models. 
 
 
## 11.1.7  Global-scale synthesis 
 
Tables 11.1 and 11.2 provide a synthesis for observed and attributed changes in extremes, and projected 
changes in extremes, respectively, at different levels of global warming. This synthesis assessment focuses 
on the more likely range of observed and projected changes. However, some low-likelihood high-impact 
scenarios can also be of high relevance as addressed in Box 11.2. 
 
Figure 11.5 provides a synthesis on the level of confidence in the attribution and projection of changes in 
extremes, building on the assessments from Tables 11.1 and 11.2. In the case where the physical processes 
underlying the changes in extremes in response to human forcing are well understood and the signal in the 
observations is still relatively weak, confidence in the projections would be higher than in the attribution 
because of an increase in the signal to noise ratio with higher global warming. On the other hand, when the 
observed signal is already strong and when observational evidence is consistent with model simulated 
responses, confidence in attribution may be higher than that in projections if certain physical processes could 
be expected to behave differently in a much warmer world and under much higher greenhouse gas forcing, 
and if such a behavior is poorly understood.  
 
Further synthesis figures for regional assessments are provided in Figure 11.4 (event attribution), Figure 11.6 
(projected change in hot temperature extremes) and Figure 11.7 (projected changes in precipitation 
extremes), and a synthesis on regional assessments for observed, attributed and projected changes in 
extremes is provided in Section 11.9 for all AR6 reference regions (See Chapter 1, section 1.4.5 and Figure 
1.18 for definition of AR6 regions).

# <goto>11.2</goto>  Data and Methods  
 
This section provides an assessment of observational data and methods used in the analysis and attribution of 
climate change specific to weather and climate extremes, and also introduces some concepts used in 
presenting future projections of extremes in the chapter. The main focus is on extreme events over land, as 
extremes in the ocean are assessed in Chapter 9 of this Report. Later sections (11.3-11.8) also provide 
additional assessments on relevant observational datasets and model validation specific for the type of 
extremes to be assessed. General background on climate modelling is provided in Chapters 4 and 10. 
 
 
## 11.2.1  Definition of extremes 
 
In the literature, an event is generally considered extreme if the value of a variable exceeds (or lies below) a 
threshold. The thresholds have been defined in different ways, leading to differences in the meaning of 
extremes that may share the same name. For example, two sets of frequency of hot/warm days have been 
used in the literature. One set counts the number of days when maximum daily temperature is above a 
relative threshold defined as the 90th or higher percentile of maximum daily temperature for the calendar day 
over a base period. An event based on such a definition can occur during any time of the year and the impact 
of such an event would differ depending on the season. The other set counts the number of days in which 
maximum daily temperature is above an absolute threshold such as 35°C, because exceedance of this 
temperature can sometimes cause health impacts (however, these impacts may depend on location and 
whether ecosystems and the population are adapted to such temperatures). While both types of hot extreme 
indices have been used to analyze changes in the frequency of hot/warm events, they represent different 
events that occur at different times of the year, possibly affected by different types of processes and 
mechanisms, and possibly also associated with different impacts.  
 
Changes in extremes have also been examined from two perspectives: changes in the frequency for a given 
magnitude of extremes or changes in the magnitude for a particular return period (frequency). Changes in the 
probability of extremes (e.g., temperature extremes) depend on the rarity of the extreme event that is 
assessed, with a larger change in probability associated with a rarer event (e.g., Kharin et al., 2018). On the 
other hand, changes in the magnitude represented by the return levels of the extreme events may not be as 
sensitive to the rarity of the event. While the answers to the two different questions are related, their 
relevance to different audiences may differ. Conclusions regarding the respective contribution of greenhouse 
gas forcing to changes in magnitude versus frequency of extremes may also differ (Otto et al., 2012). 
Correspondingly, the sensitivity of changes in extremes to increasing global warming is also dependent on 
the definition of the considered extremes. In the case of temperature extremes, changes in magnitude have 
been shown to often depend linearly on global surface temperature (Seneviratne et al., 2016; Wartenburger et 
al., 2017), while changes in frequency tend to be non-linear and can, for example, be exponential for 
increasing global warming levels (Fischer and Knutti, 2015; Kharin et al., 2018). When similar damage 
occurs once a fixed threshold is exceeded, it is more important to ask a question regarding changes in the 
frequency. But when the exceedance of this fixed threshold becomes a normal occurrence in the future, this 
can lead to a saturation in the change of probability (Harrington and Otto, 2018a). On the other hand, if the 
impact of an event increases with the intensity of the event, it would be more relevant to examine changes in 
the magnitude. Finally, adaptation to climate change might change the relevant thresholds over time, 
although such aspects are still rarely integrated in the assessment of projected changes in extremes. Framing, 
including how extremes are defined and how the questions are asked in the literature, is considered when 
forming the assessments of this chapter. 
 
## 11.2.2  Data 
 
Studies of past and future changes in weather and climate extremes and in the mean state of the climate use 
the same original sources of weather and climate observations, including in-situ observations, remotely 
sensed data, and derived data products such as reanalyses. Chapter 2 (Section 2.3) and Chapter 10 (Section 
10.2) assess various aspects of these data sources and data products from the perspective of their general use 
and in the analysis of changes in the mean state of the climate in particular. Building on these previous 
chapters, this subsection highlights particular aspects that are related to extremes and that are most relevant 
to the assessment of this chapter. The SREX (Chapter 3, Seneviratne et al., 2012) and AR5 (Chapter 2, 
Hartmann et al., 2013) addressed critical issues regarding the quality and availability of observed data and 
their relevance for the assessment of changes in extremes.  
 
Extreme weather and climate events occur on time scales of hours (e.g., convective storms that produce 
heavy precipitation) to days (e.g., tropical cyclones, heat waves), to seasons and years (e.g., droughts). A 
robust determination of long-term changes in these events can have different requirements for the spatial and 
temporal scales and sample size of the data. In general, it is more difficult to determine long-term changes 
for events of fairly large temporal duration, such as “mega-droughts” that last several years or longer (e.g., 
Ault et al. 2014), because of the limitations of the observational sample size. Literature that study changes in 
extreme precipitation and temperature often use indices representing specifics of extremes that are derived 
from daily precipitation and temperature values. Station-based indices would have the same issues as those 
for the mean climate regarding the quality, availability, and homogeneity of the data. For the purpose of 
constructing regional information and/or for comparison with model outputs, such as model evaluation, and 
detection and attribution, these station-based indices are often interpolated onto regular grids. Two different 
approaches, involving two different orders of operation, have been used in producing such gridded datasets.  
 
In some cases, such as for the HadEX3 dataset (Dunn et al., 2020), indices of extremes are computed using 
time series directly derived from stations first and are then gridded over the space. As the indices are 
computed at the station level, the gridded data products represent point estimates of the indices averaged 
over the spatial scale of the grid box. In other instances, daily values of station observations are first gridded 
(e.g., Contractor et al., 2020), and the interpolated values can then be used to compute various indices by the 
users. Depending on the station density, values for extremes computed from data gridded this way represent 
extremes of spatial scales anywhere from the size of the grid box to a point. In regions with high station 
density (e.g., North America, Europe), the gridded values are closer to extremes of area means and are thus 
more appropriate for comparisons with extremes estimated from climate model output, which is often 
considered to represent areal means (Chen and Knutson, 2008; Gervais et al., 2014; Avila et al., 2015; Di 
Luca et al., 2020a). In regions with very limited station density (e.g., Africa), the gridded values are closer to 
point estimates of extremes. The difference in spatial scales among observational data products and model 
simulations needs to be carefully accounted for when interpreting the comparison among different data 
products. For example, the average annual maximum daily maximum temperature (TXx) over land 
computed from the original ERA-interim reanalysis (at 0.75° resolution) is about 0.4°C warmer than that 
computed when the ERA-interim dataset is upscaled to the resolution of 2.5° x 3.75° (Di Luca et al., 2020). 
 
Extreme indices computed from various reanalysis data products have been used in some studies, but 
reanalysis extreme statistics have not been rigorously compared to observations (Donat et al., 2016a).  
In general, changes in temperature extremes from various reanalyses were most consistent with gridded 
observations after about 1980, but larger differences were found during the pre-satellite era (Donat et al., 
2014b). Overall, lower agreement across reanalysis datasets was found for extreme precipitation changes, 
although temporal and spatial correlations against observations were found to be still significant. In regions 
with sparse observations (e.g., Africa and parts of South America), there is generally less agreement for 
extreme precipitation between different reanalysis products, indicating a consequence of the lack of an 
observational constraint in these regions (Donat et al., 2014b, 2016a). More recent reanalyses, such as ERA5 
(Hersbach et al., 2020), seem to have improved over previous products, at least over some regions (e.g., 
Mahto and Mishra, 2019; Gleixner et al., 2020; Sheridan et al., 2020). Caution is needed when reanalysis 
data products are used to provide additional information about past changes in these extremes in regions 
where observations are generally lacking.  
 
Satellite remote sensing data have been used to provide information about precipitation extremes because 
several products provide data at sub-daily resolution for precipitation (e.g., TRMM; Maggioni et al. 2016) 
and clouds (e.g., HIMAWARI; Bessho et al., 2016; Chen et al. 2019). However, satellites do not observe the 
primary atmospheric state variables directly and polar orbiting satellites do not observe any given place at all 
times. Hence, their utility as a substitute for high-frequency (i.e., daily) ground-based observations is limited. 
For instance, Timmermans et al. (2019) found little relationship between the timing of extreme daily and 
five-day precipitation in satellite and gridded station data products over the United States.

## 11.2.3  Attribution of extremes 
 
Attribution science concerns the identification of causes for changes in characteristics of the climate system 
(e.g., trends, single extreme events). A general overview and summary of methods of attribution science is 
provided in the Cross-Working Group Box 1.1 (in Chapter 1). Trend detection using optimal fingerprinting 
methods is a well-established field, and has been assessed in the AR5  (Chapter 10, Bindoff et al., 2013), and 
Chapter 3 in this Report (Section 3.2.1). There are specific challenges when applying optimal fingerprinting 
to the detection and attribution of trends in extremes and on regional scales where the lower signal-to-noise 
ratio is a challenge. In particular, the method generally requires the data to follow a Normal (Gaussian) 
distribution, which is often not the case for extremes. Recent studies showed that extremes can, however, be 
transformed to a Gaussian distribution, for example by averaging over space, so that optimal fingerprinting 
techniques can still be used (Zhang et al., 2013; Wen et al., 2013; and Wan et al., 2019). Non-stationary 
extreme value distributions, which allow for the detailed detection and attribution of regional trends in 
temperature extremes, have also been used (Wang et al., 2017c).  
  
Apart from the detection and attribution of trends in extremes, new approaches have been developed to 
answer the question of whether and to what extent external drivers  have altered the probability and intensity 
of an individual extreme event (NASEM, 2016). In AR5, there was an emerging consensus that the role of 
external drivers of climate change in specific extreme weather events could be estimated and quantified in 
principle, but related assessments were still confined to particular case studies, often using a single model, 
and typically focusing on high-impact events with a clear attributable signal.  
 
However, since AR5, the attribution of extreme weather events has emerged as a growing field of climate 
research with an increasing body of literature (see series of supplements to the annual State of the Climate 
report (Peterson et al., 2012, 2013b, Herring et al., 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018), including the number of 
approaches to examining extreme events (described in Easterling et al., 2016; Otto, 2017; Stott et al., 2016)). 
A commonly-used approach, often called the risk-based approach in the literature and referred to here as the 
“probability-based approach”, produces statements such as ‘anthropogenic climate change made this event 
type twice as likely’ or ‘anthropogenic climate change made this event 15% more intense’. This is done by 
estimating probability distributions of the index characterizing the event in today’s climate, as well as in a 
counterfactual climate, and either comparing intensities for a given occurrence probability (e.g., 1-in-100 
year event) or probabilities for a given magnitude (see FAQ 11.3). There are a number of different analytical 
methods encompassed in the probability-based approach building on observations and statistical analyses 
(e.g., van Oldenborgh et al., 2012), optimal fingerprint methods (Sun et al., 2014), regional climate and 
weather forecast models (e.g., Schaller et al., 2016), global climate models (GCMs) (e.g., Lewis and Karoly, 
2013), and large ensembles of atmosphere-only GCMs (e.g., Lott et al., 2013). A key component in any 
event attribution analysis is the level of conditioning on the state of the climate system. In the least 
conditional approach, the combined effect of the overall warming and changes in the large-scale atmospheric 
circulation are considered and often utilize fully coupled climate models (Sun et al., 2014). Other more 
conditional approaches involve prescribing certain aspects of the climate system. These range from 
prescribing the pattern of the surface ocean change at the time of the event (e.g. Hoerling et al., 2013, 2014), 
often using AMIP-style global models, where the choice of sea surface temperature and ice patterns 
influences the attribution results (Sparrow et al., 2018), to prescribing the large-scale circulation of the 
atmosphere and using weather forecasting models or methods (e.g., Pall et al., 2017; Patricola and Wehner, 
2018; Wehner et al., 2018a). These highly conditional approaches have also been called “storylines” 
(Shepherd, 2016; Cross-Working Group Box 1.1 in Chapter 1) and can be useful when applied to extreme 
events that are too rare to otherwise analyse or where the specific atmospheric conditions were central to the 
impact. These methods are also used to enable the use of very-high-resolution simulations in cases were 
lower-resolution models do not simulate the regional atmospheric dynamics well (Shepherd, 2016; Shepherd 
et al., 2018). However, the imposed conditions limit an overall assessment of the anthropogenic influence on 
an event, as the fixed aspects of the analysis may also have been affected by climate change. For instance, 
the specified initial conditions in the highly conditional hindcast attribution approach often applied to 
tropical cyclones (e.g., Patricola and Wehner, 2018; Takayabu et al., 2015) permit only a conditional 
statement about the magnitude of the storm if similar large-scale meteorological patterns could have 
occurred in a world without climate change, thus precluding any attribution statement about the change in 
frequency if used in isolation. Combining conditional assessments of changes in the intensity with a multi-
model approach does allow for the latter as well (Shepherd, 2016). 
 
The outcome of event attribution is dependent on the definition of the event (Leach et al., 2020), as well as 
the framing (Christidis et al., 2018; Jézéquel et al., 2018; Otto et al., 2016) and uncertainties in observations 
and modelling. Observational uncertainties arise both in estimating the magnitude of an event as well as its 
rarity (Angélil et al., 2017). Results of attribution studies can also be very sensitive to the choice of climate 
variables (Sippel and Otto, 2014; Wehner et al., 2016). Attribution statements are also dependent on the 
spatial (Uhe et al., 2016; Cattiaux and Ribes, 2018; Kirchmeier‐Young et al., 2019) and temporal 
(Harrington, 2017; Leach et al., 2020) extent of event definitions, as events of different scales involve 
different processes (Zhang et al., 2020d) and large-scale averages generally yield higher attributable changes 
in magnitude or probability due to the smoothing out of the noise. In general, confidence in attribution 
statements for large-scale heat and lengthy extreme precipitation events have higher confidence than shorter 
and more localized events, such as extreme storms, an aspect also relevant for determining the emergence of 
signals in extremes or the confidence in projections (see also Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1)  
 
The reliability of the representation of the event in question in the climate models used in a study is essential 
(Angélil et al., 2016; Herger et al., 2018). Extreme events characterized by atmospheric dynamics that stretch 
the capabilities of current-generation models (see Section 10.3.3.4, Shepherd, 2014; Woollings et al., 2018) 
limit the applicability of the probability-based approach of event attribution. The lack of model evaluation, in 
particular in early event attribution studies, has led to criticism of the emerging field of attribution science as 
a whole (Trenberth et al., 2015) and of individual studies (Angélil et al., 2017). In this regard, the storyline 
approach (Shepherd, 2016) provides an alternative option that does not depend on the model’s ability to 
represent the circulation reliably. In addition, several ways of quantifying statistical uncertainty (Paciorek et 
al., 2018) and model evaluation (Lott and Stott, 2016; Philip et al., 2018b, 2020) have been employed to 
evaluate the robustness of event attribution results. For the unconditional probability-based approach, multi-
model and multi-approach (e.g., combining observational analyses and model experiments) methods have 
been used to improve the robustness of event attribution (Hauser et al., 2017; Otto et al., 2018a; Philip et al., 
2018b, 2019, 2020; van Oldenborgh et al., 2018; Kew et al., 2019).  
 
In the regional tables provided in Section 11.9, the different lines of evidence from event attribution studies 
and trend attributions are assessed alongside one another to provide an assessment of the human contribution 
to observed changes in extremes in all AR6 regions .  
 
 
## 11.2.4  Projecting changes in extremes as a function of global warming levels  
 
The most important quantity used to characterize past and future climate change is global warming relative 
to its pre-industrial level. On the one hand, changes in global warming are linked quasi-linearly to global 
cumulative CO2 emissions (IPCC, 2013). On the other hand, changes in regional climate, including many 
types of extremes, scale quasi-linearly with changes in global warming, often independently of the 
underlying emissions scenarios (SR15 Ch3; Seneviratne et al., 2016; Wartenburger et al., 2017; Matthews et 
al., 2017; Tebaldi and Knutti 2018, Sun et al., 2018a, Kharin et al., 2018, Beusch et al., 2020b; Li et al., 
2020). Finally, the use of global warming levels in the context of global policy documents (in particular the 
2015 Paris Agreement, UNFCCC 2015), implies that information on changes in the climate system, and in 
particular extremes, as a function of global warming are of particular policy relevance. Cross-Chapter Box 
11.1 provides on overview on the translation between information at global warming levels (GWLs) and 
scenarios. 
 
The assessment of projections of future changes in extremes as function of GWL has an advantage in 
separating uncertainty associated with the global warming response (see Chapter 4) from the uncertainty 
resulting from the regional climate response as a function of GWLs (Seneviratne and Hauser, 2020). If the 
interest is in the projection of regional changes at certain GWLs, such as those defined by the Paris 
Agreement, projections based on time periods and emission scenarios have unnecessarily larger uncertainty 
due to differences in model global transient climate responses. To take advantage of this feature and to 
provide easy comparison with SR15, assessments of projected changes in this chapter are largely provided in 
relation to future GWLs, with a focus on changes at +1.5°C, +2°C, and +4°C of global warming above pre-
industrial levels (e.g. Tables 11.1, 11.2 and regional tables in Section 11.9). These encompass a scenario 
compatible with the aim of the Paris Agreement (+1.5°C), a scenario slightly overshooting the aims of the 
Paris Agreement (+2°C), and a “worst-case” scenario with no mitigation (+4°C). The CC-Box 11.1 provides 
a background on the GWL sampling approach used in the AR6, both for the computation of GWL 
projections from ESMs contributing to the 6th Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) 
as well as for the mapping of existing scenario-based literature for CMIP6 and the 5th Phase of CMIP 
(CMIP5) to assessments as function of GWLs (see also Section 11.9. and Table 11.3 for an example). 
 
While regional changes in many types of extremes do scale robustly with global surface temperature, 
generally irrespective of emission scenarios (Section 11.1.4; Figures 11.3, 11.6, 11.7; CC-Box 11.1), effects 
of local forcing can distort this relation. In particular, emission scenarios with the same radiative forcing can 
have different regional extreme precipitation responses resulting from different aerosol forcing (Wang et al., 
2017d). Another example is related to forcing from land use and land cover changes (Section 11.1.6). 
Climate models often either overestimate or underestimate observed changes in annual maximum daily 
maximum temperature depending on the region and considered models (Donat et al., 2017; Vautard et al., 
9999). Part of the discrepancies may be due to the lack of representation of some land forcings, in particular 
crop intensification and irrigation (Mueller et al., 2016b; Thiery et al., 2017; Findell et al., 2017; Thiery et 
al., 2020). Since these local forcings are not represented and their future changes are difficult to project, 
these can be important caveats when using GWL scaling to project future changes for these regions. 
However, these caveats also apply to the use of scenario-based projections. 
 
SR15 (Chapter 3) assessed different climate responses at +1.5°C of global warming, including transient 
climate responses, short-term stabilization responses, and long-term equilibrium stabilization responses, and 
their implications for future projections of different extremes. Indeed, the temporal dimension, that is, when 
the given GWL occurs, also matters for projections, in particular beyond the 21st century and for some 
climate variables with large inertia (e.g., sea level rise and associated extremes). Nonetheless, for 
assessments focused on conditions within the next decades and for the main extremes considered in this 
chapter, derived projections are relatively insensitive to details of climate scenarios and can be well 
estimated based on transient simulations (CC-Box 11.1; see also SR15). 
 
An important question is the identification of the GWL at which a given change in a climate extreme can 
begin to emerge from climate noise. Figure 11.8 displays analyses of the GWLs at which emergence in hot 
extremes (20-year return values of TXx, TXx_20yr) and heavy precipitation (20-year return values of 
Rx1day, Rx1day_20yr) is identified in AR6 regions for the whole CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensembles). Overall, 
signals for extremes emerge very early for TXx_20yr, already below 0.2°C in many regions (Fig. 11.8a,b), 
and at around 0.5°C in most regions. This is consistent with conclusions from the SR15 Ch3 for less-rare 
temperature extremes (TXx on the yearly time scale), which shows that a difference as small as 0.5°C of 
global warming, e.g. between +1.5°C and +2°C of global warming, leads to detectable differences in 
temperature extremes in TXx in most WGI AR6 regions in CMIP5 projections (e.g.,Wartenburger et al., 
2017; Seneviratne et al., 2018b). The GWL emergence for Rx1day_20yr is also largely consistent with 
analyses for less-extreme heavy precipitation events (Rx5day on the yearly time scale) in the SR15 (see 
Chapter 3).  
 
To some extent, analyses as functions of GWLs replace the time axis with a global surface temperature axis. 
Nonetheless, information on the timing of given changes in extremes is obviously also relevant. Regarding 
this information, that is, the time frame at which given global warming levels are reached, the readers are 
referred to Chapter 4 (Section 4.6; see also CC-Box 11.1). Figure 11.5 provides a synthesis of attributed and 
projected changes in extremes as function of GWLs (see also Figs. 11.3, 11.6, and 11.7 for regional 
analyses).

# <goto>11.3</goto>  Temperature extremes 
 
This section assesses changes in temperature extremes at global, continental and regional scales. The main 
focus is on the changes in the magnitude and frequency of moderate extreme temperatures (those that occur 
several times a year) to very extreme temperatures (those that occur once-in-10-years or longer) of time 
scales from a day to a season, though there is a strong emphasis on the daily scale where literature is most 
concentrated.  
 
 
## 11.3.1  Mechanisms and drivers 
 
The SREX (IPCC, 2012) and AR5 (IPCC, 2014) concluded that greenhouse gas forcing is the dominant 
factor for the increases in the intensity, frequency, and duration of warm extremes and the decrease in those 
of cold extremes. This general global-scale warming is modulated by large-scale atmospheric circulation 
patterns, as well as by feedbacks such as soil moisture-evapotranspiration-temperature and snow/ice-albedo-
temperature feedbacks, and local forcings such as land use change or changes in aerosol concentrations at the 
regional and local scales (Box 11.1, Sections 11.1.5, 11.1.6). Therefore, changes in temperature extremes at 
regional and local scales can have heterogeneous spatial distributions. Changes in the magnitudes (or 
intensities) of extreme temperatures are often larger than changes in global surface temperature, because of 
larger warming on land than on the ocean surface (2.3.1.1) and feedbacks, though they are of similar 
magnitude to changes in the local mean temperature (Fig 11.2).  
 
Extreme temperature events are associated with large-scale meteorological patterns (Grotjahn et al., 2016). 
Quasi-stationary anticyclonic circulation anomalies or atmospheric blocking events are linked to temperature 
extremes in many regions, such as in Australia (Parker et al., 2014; Perkins-Kirkpatrick et al., 2016), Europe 
(Brunner et al., 2017, 2018; Schaller et al., 2018), Eurasia (Yao et al., 2017), Asia (Chen et al., 2016; Ratnam 
et al., 2016; Rohini et al., 2016), and North America (Yu et al., 2018, 2019b; Zhang and Luo, 2019). Mid-
latitude planetary wave modulations affect short-duration temperature extremes such as heat waves (Perkins, 
2015; Kornhuber et al., 2020). The large-scale modes of variability (Annex VI) affect the strength, 
frequency, and persistence of these meteorological patterns and, hence, temperature extremes. For example, 
cold and warm extremes in the mid-latitudes are associated with atmospheric circulation patterns such as the 
Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern, as well as atmosphere-ocean coupled modes such as Pacific Decadal 
Variability (PDV), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV) 
(Kamae et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2018; Ruprich-Robert et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2018, 2019a; Müller et al., 
2020; Section 11.1.5). Changes in the modes of variability in response to warming would therefore affect 
temperature extremes (Clark and Brown, 2013; Horton et al., 2015). The level of confidence in those 
changes, both in the observations and in future projections, varies, affecting the level of confidence in 
changes in temperature extremes in different regions. As highlighted in Chapters 2-4 of this Report, it is 
likely that there have been observational changes in the extratropical jets and mid-latitude jet meandering 
(Section 2.3.1.4.3; Cross-Chapter Box 10.1). There is low confidence in possible effects of Arctic warming 
on mid-latitude temperature extremes (Cross-Chapter Box 10.1). A large portion of the multi-decadal 
changes in extreme temperature remains after the removal of the effect of these modes of variability and can 
be attributed to human influence (Kamae et al., 2017b; Wan et al., 2019). Thus, global warming dominates 
changes in temperature extremes at the regional scale and it is very unlikely that dynamic responses to 
greenhouse-gas induced warming would alter the direction of these changes.  
 
Land-atmosphere feedbacks strongly modulate regional- and local-scale changes in temperature extremes 
(high confidence; Section 11.1.6; Seneviratne et al., 2013; Lemordant et al., 2016; Donat et al., 2017; 
Sillmann et al., 2017b; Hirsch et al., 2019). This effect is particularly notable in mid-latitude regions where 
the drying of soil moisture amplifies high temperatures, in particular through increases in sensible heat flux 
(Whan et al., 2015; Douville et al., 2016; Vogel et al., 2017). Land-atmosphere feedbacks amplifying 
temperature extremes  also include boundary-layer feedbacks and effects on atmospheric circulation 
(Miralles et al., 2014a; Schumacher et al., 2019). Soil moisture-temperature feedbacks affect past and 
present-day heat waves in observations and model simulations, both locally (Miralles et al. 2014; Hauser et 
al. 2016; Meehl et al. 2016; Wehrli et al., 2019; Cowan et al., 2016) and beyond the regions of feedback 
occurrence through changes in regional circulation patterns (Koster et al., 2016; Sato and Nakamura, 2019; 
Stéfanon et al., 2014). The uncertainty due to the representation of land-atmosphere feedbacks in ESMs is a 
cause of discrepancy between observations and simulations (Clark et al., 2006; Mueller and Seneviratne, 
2014; Meehl et al., 2016). The decrease of plant transpiration or the increase of stomata resistance under 
enhanced CO2 concentrations is a direct CO2 forcing of land temperatures (warming due to reduced 
evaporative cooling), which contributes to higher warming on land (Lemordant et al., 2016; Vicente-Serrano 
et al., 2020c). The snow/ice-albedo feedback plays an important role in amplifying temperature variability in 
the high latitudes (Diro et al. 2018) and can be the largest contributor to the rapid warming of cold extremes 
in the mid- and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere (Gross et al., 2020).  
 
Regional external forcings, including land-use changes and emissions of anthropogenic aerosols, play an 
important role in the changes of temperature extremes in some regions (high confidence, Section 11.1.6). 
Deforestation may have contributed to about one third of the warming of hot extremes in some mid-latitude 
regions since the pre-industrial time (Lejeune et al., 2018). Aspects of agricultural practice, including no-till 
farming, irrigation, and overall cropland intensification, may cool hot temperature extremes (Davin et al., 
2014; Mueller et al., 2016b). For instance, cropland intensification has been suggested to be responsible for a 
cooling of the highest temperature percentiles in the US Midwest (Mueller et al., 2016b). Irrigation has been 
shown to be responsible for a cooling of hot temperature extremes of up to 1-2°C in many mid-latitude 
regions in the present climate (Thiery et al., 2017; Thiery et al., 2020), a process not represented in most of 
state-of-the-art ESMs (CMIP5, CMIP6). Double cropping may have led to increased hot extremes in the 
inter-cropping season in part of China (Jeong et al., 2014). Rapid increases in summertime warming in 
western Europe and northeast Asia since the 1980s are linked to a reduction in anthropogenic aerosol 
precursor emissions over Europe (Dong et al., 2016, 2017; Nabat et al., 2014), in addition to the effect of 
increased greenhouse gas forcing (see also Chapter 10, Section 10.1.3.1). This effect of aerosols on 
temperature-related extremes is also noted for declines in short-lived anthropogenic aerosol emissions over 
North America (Mascioli et al., 2016). On the local scale, the urban heat island (UHI) effect results in higher 
temperatures in urban areas than in their surrounding regions and contributes to warming in regions of rapid 
urbanization, in particular for night-time temperature extremes (Box 10.3; Phelan et al., 2015; Chapman et 
al., 2017; Sun et al., 2019). But these local and regional forcings are generally not (well-) represented in the 
CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulations (see also Section 11.3.3), contributing to uncertainty in model simulated 
changes.  
 
In summary, greenhouse gas forcing is the dominant driver leading to the warming of temperature extremes. 
At regional scales, changes in temperature extremes are modulated by changes in large-scale patterns and 
modes of variability, feedbacks including soil moisture-evapotranspiration-temperature or snow/ice-albedo-
temperature feedbacks, and local and regional forcings such as land use and land cover changes, or aerosol 
concentrations, and decadal and multidecadal natural variability. This leads to heterogeneity in regional 
changes and their associated uncertainties (high confidence). Urbanization has exacerbated the effects of 
global warming in cities, in particular for night-time temperature extremes (high confidence).    

## 11.3.2  Observed trends  
 
The SREX (IPCC, 2012) reported a very likely decrease in the number of cold days and nights and increase 
in the number of warm days and nights at the global scale. Confidence in trends was assessed as regionally 
variable (low to medium confidence) due to either a lack of observations or varying signals in sub-regions.  
 
Since SREX (IPCC, 2012) and AR5 (IPCC, 2014), many regional-scale studies have examined trends in 
temperature extremes using different metrics that are based on daily temperatures, such as the 
CCl/WCRP/JCOMM Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) indices (Dunn et 
al., 2020). The additional observational records, along with a stronger warming signal, show very clearly that 
changes observed at the time of AR5 (IPCC, 2014) continued, providing strengthened evidence of an 
increase in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes and decrease in the intensity and frequency of cold 
extremes. While the magnitude of the observed trends in temperature-related extremes varies depending on 
the region, spatial and temporal scales, and metric assessed, evidence of a warming effect is overwhelming, 
robust, and consistent. In particular, an increase in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes is almost 
always associated with an increase in the hottest temperatures and in the number of heatwave days. It is also 
the case for changes in cold extremes. For this reason, and to simplify the presentation, the phrase “increase 
in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes” is used to represent, collectively, an increase in the 
magnitude of extreme day and/or night temperatures, in the number of warm days and/or nights, and in the 
number of heat wave days. Changes in cold extremes are assessed similarly.  
 
On the global scale, evidence of an increase in the number of warm days and nights and a decrease in the 
number of cold days and nights, and an increase in the coldest and hottest extreme temperatures is very 
robust and consistent among all variables. Figure 11.2 displays timeseries of globally-averaged annual 
maximum daily maximum (TXx) and annual minimum daily minimum temperature (TNn) on land. Warming 
of land mean TXx is similar to the mean land warming, which is about 45% higher than global warming 
(Section 2.3.1). Warming of land mean TNn is even higher, with about 3°C of warming since 1960 (Figure 
11.2). Figure 11.9 shows maps of linear trends over 1960-2018 in the annual maximum daily maximum 
(TXx), the annual minimum daily minimum temperature (TNn), and frequency of warm days (TX90p). The 
maps for TXx and TNn show trends consistent with overall warming in most regions, with a particularly 
high warming of TXx in Europe and north-western South America, and a particularly high warming of TNn 
in the Arctic. Consistent with the observed warming in global surface temperature (2.3.1.2) and the observed 
trends in TXx and TNn, the frequency of TX90p has increased while that of cold nights (TN10p) has 
decreased since the 1950s: Nearly all land regions showed statistically significant decreases in TN10p 
(Alexander, 2016; Dunn et al., 2020), though trends in TX90p are variable with some decreases in southern 
South America, mainly during austral summer (Rusticucci et al., 2017). A decrease in the number of cold 
spell days is also observed over nearly all land surface areas (Easterling et al., 2016) and in the northern mid-
latitudes in particular (van Oldenborgh et al., 2019). These observed changes are also consistent when a new 
global land surface daily air temperature dataset is analyzed (Zhang et al., 2019c). Consistent warming trends 
in temperature extremes globally, and in most land areas, over the past century are also found in a range of 
observation-based data sets (Fischer and Knutti, 2014; Donat et al., 2016a; Dunn et al., 2020), with the 
extremes related to daily minimum temperatures changing faster than those related to daily maximum 
temperatures (Dunn et al., 2020) (Fig. 11.2). Seasonal variations in trends in temperature-related extremes 
have been demonstrated. A warming in warm-season temperature extremes is detected, even during the 
“slower surface global warming” period from the late 1990s to early 2010s (Cross-Chapter Box 3.1) (Kamae 
et al., 2014; Seneviratne et al., 2014; Imada et al., 2017). Many studies of past changes in temperature 
extremes for particular regions or countries show trends consistent with this global picture, as summarized 
below and in Tables 11.4, 11.7, 11.10, 11.13, 11.16 and 11.19 in Section 11.9.  
 
<figref>11.9</figref> 
 
In Africa (Table 11.4), while it is difficult to assess changes in temperature extremes in parts of the continent 
because of a lack of data, evidence of an increase in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes and decrease 
in the intensity and frequency of cold extremes is clear and robust in regions where data are available. These 
include an increase in the frequency of warm days and nights and a decrease in the frequency of cold days 
and nights with high confidence (Donat et al., 2013b, 2014b; Kruger and Sekele, 2013; Chaney et al., 2014; 
Filahi et al., 2016; Moron et al., 2016; Ringard et al., 2016; Barry et al., 2018; Gebrechorkos et al., 2018) and 
an increase in heat waves (Russo et al., 2016; Ceccherini et al., 2017). The increase in TNn is more notable 
than in TXx (Figure 11.9). Cold spells occasionally strike subtropical areas, but are likely to have decreased 
in frequency (Barry et al., 2018). The frequency of cold events has likely decreased in South Africa (Song et 
al., 2014; Kruger and Nxumalo, 2017), North Africa (Driouech et al., 2021; Filahi et al., 2016), and the 
Sahara (Donat et al., 2016a). Over the whole continent, there is medium confidence in an increase in the 
intensity and frequency of hot extremes and decrease in the intensity and frequency of cold extremes; it is 
likely that similar changes have also occurred in areas with poor data coverage, as warming is widespread 
and as projected future changes are similar over all regions (11.3.5). 
 
In Asia (Table 11.7), there is very robust evidence for a very likely increase in the intensity and frequency of 
hot extremes and decrease in the intensity and frequency of cold extremes in recent decades. This is clear in 
global studies (e.g. Alexander, 2016; Dunn et al., 2020), as well as in numerous regional studies (Table 
11.7). The area fraction with extreme warmth in Asia increased during 1951–2016 (Imada et al., 2018). The 
frequency of warm extremes increased and the frequency of cold extremes decreased in East Asia (Zhou et 
al., 2016a; Chen and Zhai, 2017; Yin et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2018c; Qian et al., 2019) and west Asia (Acar 
Deniz and Gönençgil, 2015; Erlat and Türkeş, 2016; Imada et al., 2017; Rahimi et al., 2018; Rahimi and 
Hejabi, 2018) with high confidence. The duration of heat extremes has also lengthened in some regions, for 
example, in southern China (Luo and Lau, 2016), but there is medium confidence of heat extremes increasing 
in frequency in South Asia (AlSarmi and Washington, 2014; Sheikh et al., 2015; Mazdiyasni et al., 2017; 
Zahid et al., 2017; Nasim et al., 2018; Khan et al., 2019; Roy, 2019). Warming trends in daily temperature 
extremes indices have also been observed in central Asia (Hu et al., 2016; Feng et al., 2018), the Hindu Kush 
Himalaya (Sun et al., 2017), and Southeast Asia (Supari et al., 2017; Cheong et al., 2018). The intensity and 
frequency of cold spells in all Asian regions have been decreasing since the beginning of the 20th century 
(high confidence) (Sheikh et al., 2015; Donat et al., 2016a; Dong et al., 2018; van Oldenborgh et al., 2019). 
  
In Australasia (Table 11.10), there is very robust evidence for very likely increases in the number of warm 
days and warm nights and decrease in the number of cold days and cold nights since 1950 (Lewis and King, 
2015; Jakob and Walland, 2016; Alexander and Arblaster, 2017). The increase in extreme minimum 
temperatures occurs in all seasons over most of Australia and typically exceeds the increase in extreme 
maximum temperatures (Wang et al., 2013b; Jakob and Walland, 2016). However, some parts of southern 
Australia have shown stable or increased numbers of frost days since the 1980s (Dittus et al., 2014) (see also 
Section 11.3.4). Similar positive trends in extreme minimum and maximum temperatures have been 
observed in New Zealand, in particular in the autumn-winter seasons, although they generally show higher 
spatial variability (Caloiero, 2017). In the tropical Western Pacific region, spatially coherent warming trends 
in maximum and minimum temperature extremes have been reported for the period of 1951–2011 (Whan et 
al., 2014; McGree et al., 2019).  
 
In Central and South America (Table 11.13), there is high confidence that observed hot extremes (TN90p, 
TX90p) have increased and cold extremes (TN10p, TX10p) have decreased over recent decades, though 
trends vary among different extremes types, datasets, and regions (Dereczynski et al., 2020; Dittus et al., 
2016; Dunn et al., 2020; Meseguer-Ruiz et al., 2018; Olmo et al., 2020; Rusticucci et al., 2017; Salvador and 
de Brito, 2018; Skansi et al., 2013). An increase in the intensity and frequency of heatwave events was also 
observed between 1961 and 2014, in an area covering most of South America (Ceccherini et al., 2016; 
Geirinhas et al., 2018). However, there is medium confidence that warm extremes (TXx and TX90p) have 
decreased in the last decades over the central region of SES during austral summer (Tencer, B.; Rusticucci, 
2012; Skansi et al., 2013; Rusticucci et al., 2017; Wu and Polvani, 2017). There is medium confidence that 
TNn extremes are increasing faster than TXx extremes, with the largest warming rates observed over 
Northeast Brazil (NEB) and North South America (NSA) for cold nights (Skansi et al., 2013).  
 
In Europe (Table 11.16), there is very robust evidence for a very likely increase in maximum temperatures 
and the frequency of heat waves. The increase in the magnitude and frequency of high maximum 
temperatures has been observed consistently across regions including in central (Twardosz and Kossowska-
Cezak, 2013; Christidis et al., 2015; Lorenz et al., 2019) and southern Europe (Croitoru and Piticar, 2013; El 
Kenawy et al., 2013; Christidis et al., 2015; Nastos and Kapsomenakis, 2015; Fioravanti et al., 2016; Ruml et 
al., 2017). In northern Europe, a strong increase in extreme winter warming events has been observed 
(Matthes et al., 2015; Vikhamar-Schuler et al., 2016). Temperature observations for wintertime cold spells 
show a long-term decreasing frequency in Europe (Brunner et al., 2018; van Oldenborgh et al., 2019), and 
typical cold spells such as that observed during the 2009/2010 winter had an occurrence probability that is 
twice smaller currently than if climate change had not occurred (Christiansen et al., 2018). 
 
In North America (Table 11.19), there is very robust evidence for a very likely increase in the intensity and 
frequency of hot extremes and decrease in the intensity and frequency of cold extremes for the whole 
continent, though there are substantial spatial and seasonal variations in the trends. Minimum temperatures 
display warming consistently across the continent, while there are more contrasting trends in the annual 
maximum daily temperatures in parts of the USA (Figure 11.9) (Lee et al., 2014; van Oldenborgh et al., 
2019; Dunn et al., 2020). In Canada, there is a clear increase in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes 
and decrease in the intensity and frequency of cold extremes (Vincent et al., 2018). In Mexico, a clear 
warming trend in TNn was found, particularly in the northern arid region (Montero-Martínez et al., 2018). 
The number of warm days has increased and the number of cold days has decreased (García-Cueto et al., 
2019). Cold spells have undergone a reduction in magnitude and intensity in all regions of North America 
(Bennett and Walsh, 2015; Donat et al., 2016a; Grotjahn et al., 2016; Vose et al., 2017; García-Cueto et al., 
2019; van Oldenborgh et al., 2019).  
 
Extreme heat events have increased around the Arctic since 1979, particularly over Arctic North America 
and Greenland (Matthes et al., 2015; Dobricic et al., 2020), which is consistent with summer melt (9.4.1).  
Observations north of 60˚N show increases in wintertime warm days and nights over 1979-2015, while cold 
days and nights declined (Sui et al., 2017). Extreme heat days are particularly strong in winter, with 
observations showing the warmest mid-winter temperatures at the North Pole rising at twice the rate of mean 
temperature (Moore, 2016), as well as increases in Arctic winter warm days (T>-10℃) (Vikhamar-Schuler et 
al., 2016; Graham et al., 2017). Arctic annual minimum temperatures have increased at about three times the 
rate of global surface temperature since the 1960s (Figs. 11.2, 11.9), consistent with the observed mean cold 
season (October-May) warming of 3.1°C in the region (Atlas 11.2). 
 
Trends in some measures of heat waves are also observed at the global scale. Globally-averaged heat wave 
intensity, heat wave duration, and the number of heat wave days have significantly increased from 1950-
2011 (Perkins, 2015). There are some regional differences in trends in characteristics of heat waves with 
significant increases reported in Europe (Russo et al., 2015; Forzieri et al., 2016; Sánchez-Benítez et al., 
2020) and Australia (CSIRO and BOM, 2016; Alexander and Arblaster, 2017). In Africa, there is medium 
confidence that heat waves, regardless of the definition, have been becoming more frequent, longer-lasting, 
and hotter over more than three decades (Fontaine et al., 2013; Mouhamed et al., 2013; Ceccherini et al., 
2016, 2017; Forzieri et al., 2016; Moron et al., 2016; Russo et al., 2016). The majority of heat wave 
characteristics examined in China between 1961-2014 show increases in heat wave days, consistent with 
warming (You et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2020). Increases in the frequency and duration of heat waves are also 
observed in Mongolia (Erdenebat and Sato, 2016) and India (Ratnam et al., 2016; Rohini et al., 2016). In the 
UK, the lengths of short heat waves have increased since the 1970s, while the lengths of long heat waves 
(over 10 days) have decreased over some stations in the southeast of England (Sanderson et al., 2017b). In 
Central and South America, there are increases in the frequency of heat waves (Barros et al., 2015; 
Bitencourt et al., 2016; Ceccherini et al., 2016; Piticar, 2018), although decreases in Excess Heat Factor 
(EHF), which is a metric for heat wave intensity, are observed in South America in data derived from 
HadGHCND (Cavanaugh and Shen, 2015).  
 
In summary, it is virtually certain that there has been an increase in the number of warm days and nights and 
a decrease in the number of cold days and nights on the global scale since 1950. Both the coldest extremes 
and hottest extremes display increasing temperatures. It is very likely that these changes have also occurred 
at the regional scale in Europe, Australasia, Asia, and North America. It is virtually certain that there has 
been increases in the intensity and duration of heat waves and in the number of heat wave days at the global 
scale. These trends likely occur in Europe, Asia, and Australia. There is medium confidence in similar 
changes in temperature extremes in Africa and high confidence in South America; the lower confidence is 
due to reduced data availability and fewer studies. Annual minimum temperatures on land have increased 
about three times more than global surface temperature since the 1960s, with particularly strong warming in 
the Arctic (high confidence). 
  
 
## 11.3.3  Model evaluation  
 
AR5 assessed that CMIP3 and CMIP5 models generally captured the observed spatial distributions of the 
mean state and that the inter-model range of simulated temperature extremes was similar to the spread 
estimated from different observational datasets; the models generally captured trends in the second half of 
the 20th century for indices of extreme temperature, although they tended to overestimate trends in hot 
extremes and underestimate trends in cold extremes (Flato et al., 2013). Post-AR5 studies on the CMIP5 
models’ performance in simulating mean and changes in temperature extremes continue to support the AR5 
assessment (Fischer and Knutti, 2014; Sillmann et al., 2014; Ringard et al., 2016; Borodina et al., 2017b; 
Donat et al., 2017; Di Luca et al., 2020a). Over Africa, the observed warming in temperature extremes is 
captured by CMIP5 models, although it is underestimated in west and central Africa (Sherwood et al., 2014; 
Diedhiou et al., 2018). Over East Asia, the CMIP5 ensemble performs well in reproducing the observed 
trend in temperature extremes averaged over China (Dong et al., 2015). Over Australia, the multi-model 
mean performs better than individual models in capturing observed trends in gridded station based ETCCDI 
temperature indices (Alexander and Arblaster, 2017).  
 
Initial analyses of CMIP6 simulations (Chen et al., 2020a; Di Luca et al., 2020b; Kim et al., 2020; Li et al., 
2020a; Thorarinsdottir et al., 2020; Wehner et al., 2020) indicate the CMIP6 models perform similarly to the 
CMIP5 models regarding biases in hot and cold extremes. In general, CMIP5 and CMIP6 historical 
simulations are similar in their performance in simulating the observed climatology of extreme temperatures 
(high confidence). The general warm bias in hot extremes and cold bias in cold extremes reported for CMIP5 
models (Kharin et al., 2013; Sillmann et al., 2013a) remain in CMIP6 models (Di Luca et al., 2020b). 
However, there is some evidence that CMIP6 models better represent some of the underlying processes 
leading to extreme temperatures, such as seasonal and diurnal variability and synoptic-scale variability (Di 
Luca et al., 2020b). Whether these improvements are sufficient to enhance our understanding of past changes 
or to reduce uncertainties in future projections remains unclear. The relative error estimates in the simulation 
of various indices of temperature extremes in the available CMIP6 models show that no single model 
performs the best on all indices and the multi-model ensemble seems to out-perform any individual model 
due to its reduction in systematic bias (Kim et al., 2020). Figure 11.10 show errors in the 1979-2014 average 
annual TXx and annual TNn simulated by available CMIP6 models in comparison with HadEX3 and ERA5 
(Li et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020, Wehner et al., 2020). While the magnitude of the model error depends on 
the reference data set, the model evaluations drawn from different reference data sets are quite similar. In 
general, models reproduce the spatial patterns and magnitudes of both cold and hot temperature extremes 
quite well. There are also systematic biases. Hot extremes tend to be too cool in mountainous and high-
latitude regions, but too warm in the eastern United States and South America. For cold extremes, CMIP6 
models are too cool, except in northeastern Eurasia and the southern mid-latitudes. Errors in seasonal mean 
temperatures are uncorrelated with errors in extreme temperatures and are often of opposite sign (Wehner et 
al., 2020).  
 
<figref>11.10</figref> 
 
Atmospheric model (AMIP) simulations are often used in event attribution studies to assess the influence of 
global warming on observed temperature-related extremes. These simulations typically capture the observed 
trends in temperature extremes, though some regional features, such as the lack of warming in daytime warm 
temperature extremes over South America and parts of North America, are not reproduced in the model 
simulations (Dittus et al., 2018), possibly due to internal variability, deficiencies in local surface processes, 
or forcings that are not represented in the SSTs. Additionally, the AMIP models assessed tend to produce 
overly persistent heat wave events. This bias in the duration of the events does not impact the reliability of 
the models’ positive trends (Freychet et al., 2018).  
 
Several regional climate models (RCMs) have also been evaluated in terms of their performance in 
simulating the climatology of extremes in various regions of the Coordinated Regional Downscaling 
Experiment (CORDEX) (Giorgi et al., 2009), especially in East Asia (Ji and Kang, 2015; Yu et al., 2015; 
Park et al., 2016; Bucchignani et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2017a; Niu et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2018b; Wang et al., 
2018a), Europe (Cardoso et al., 2019; Gaertner et al., 2018; Jacob et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020; Lorenz et 
al., 2019; Smiatek et al., 2016; Vautard et al., 2013; Vautard et al., 2020b), and Africa (Kim et al., 2014b; 
Diallo et al., 2015; Dosio, 2017; Samouly et al., 2018; Mostafa et al., 2019). Compared to GCMs, RCM 
simulations show an added value in simulating temperature-related extremes, though this depends on 
topographical complexity and the parameters employed (see Section 10.3.3). The improvement with 
resolution is noted in East Asia (Park et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2016b; Shi et al., 2017; Hui et al., 2018). 
However, in the European CORDEX ensemble, different aerosol climatologies with various degrees of 
complexity were used in projections (Bartók et al., 2017; Lorenz et al., 2019) and the land surface models 
used in the RCMs do not account for physiological CO2 effects on photosynthesis leading to enhanced water-
use efficiency and decreased evapotranspiration (Schwingshackl et al., 2019), which could lead to biases in 
the representation of temperature extremes in these projections (Boé et al., 2020). In addition, there are key 
cold biases in temperature extremes over areas with complex topography (Niu et al., 2018). Over North 
America, 12 RCMs were evaluated over the ARCTIC-CORDEX region (Diaconescu et al., 2018). Models 
were able to simulate well climate indices related to mean air temperature and hot extremes over most of the 
Canadian Arctic, with the exception of the Yukon region where models displayed the largest biases related to 
topographic effects. Two RCMs were evaluated against observed extremes indices over North America over 
the period 1989–2009, with a cool bias in minimum temperature extremes shown in both RCMs (Whan and 
Zwiers, 2016). The most significant biases are found in TXx and TNn, with fewer differences in the 
simulation of annual minimum daily maximum temperature (TXn) and annual maximum daily minimum 
temperature (TNx) in central and western North America. Over Central and South America, maximum 
temperatures from the Eta RCM are generally underestimated, although hot days, warm nights, and heat 
waves are increasing in the period 1961-1990, in agreement with observations (Chou et al., 2014b; Tencer et 
al., 2016; Bozkurt et al., 2019). 
 
Some land forcings are not well represented in climate models. As highlighted in the IPCC SRCCL Ch2, 
there is high agreement that temperate deforestation leads to summer warming and winter cooling (Bright et 
al., 2017; Zhao and Jackson, 2014; Gálos et al., 2011, 2013; Wickham et al., 2013; Ahlswede and Thomas, 
2017; Anderson-Teixeira et al., 2012; Anderson et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2012; Strandberg and Kjellström, 
2019), which has substantially contributed to the warming of hot extremes in the northern mid-latitudes over 
the course of the 20th century (Lejeune et al., 2018) and in recent years (Strandberg and Kjellström, 2019). 
However, observed forest effects on the seasonal and diurnal cycle of temperature are not well captured in 
several ESMs: while observations show a cooling effect of forest cover compared to non-forest vegetation 
during daytime (Li et al., 2015), in particular in arid, temperate, and tropical regions (Alkama and Cescatti, 
2016), several ESMs simulate a warming of daytime temperatures for regions with forest vs non-forest cover 
(Lejeune et al., 2017). Also irrigation effects, which can lead to regional cooling of temperature extremes, 
are generally not integrated in current-generations of ESMs (Section 11.3.1). 
 
In summary, there is high confidence that climate models can reproduce the mean state and overall warming 
of temperature extremes observed globally and in most regions, although the magnitude of the trends may 
differ. The ability of models to capture observed trends in temperature-related extremes depends on the 
metric evaluated, the way indices are calculated, and the time periods and spatial scales considered. Regional 
climate models add value in simulating temperature-related extremes over GCMs in some regions. Some 
land forcings on temperature extremes are not well captured (effects of deforestation) or generally not 
representated (irrigation) in ESMs. 
 
 
## 11.3.4  Detection and attribution, event attribution 
 
SREX (IPCC, 2012) assessed that it is likely anthropogenic influences have led to the warming of extreme 
daily minimum and maximum temperatures at the global scale. AR5 concluded that human influence has 
very likely contributed to the observed changes in the intensity and frequency of daily temperature extremes 
on the global scale in the second half of the 20th century (IPCC, 2014). With regard to individual, or 
regionally- or locally-specific events, AR5 concluded that it is likely human influence has substantially 
increased the probability of occurrence of heat waves in some locations. 
 
Studies since AR5 continue to attribute the observed increase in the frequency or intensity of hot extremes 
and the observed decrease in the frequency or intensity of cold extremes to human influence, dominated by 
anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, on global and continental scales, and for many AR6 regions. These 
include attribution of changes in the magnitude of annual TXx, TNx, TXn, and TNn, based on different 
observational data sets including, HadEX2 and HadEX3, CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulations, and different 
statistical methods (Kim et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017c; Seong et al., 2020). As is the case for an increase in 
mean temperature (3.3.1), an increase in extreme temperature is mostly due to greenhouse gas forcing, off-
set by aerosol forcing. The aerosols’ cooling effect is clearly detectable over Europe and Asia (Seong et al., 
2020). As much as 75% of the moderate daily hot extremes (above 99.9th percentile) over land are due to 
anthropogenic warming (Fischer and Knutti, 2015). New results are found to be more robust due to the 
extended period that improves the signal-to-noise ratio. The effect of anthropogenic forcing is clearly 
detectable and attributable in the observed changes in these indicators of temperature extremes, even at 
country and sub-country scales, such as in Canada (Wan et al., 2019). Changes in the number of warm 
nights, warm days, cold nights, and cold days, and other indicators such as the Warm Spell Duration Index 
(WSDI), are also attributed to anthropogenic influence (Hu et al., 2020; Christidis and Stott, 2016).  
 
Regional studies, including for Asia (Dong et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2018), Australia (Alexander and Arblaster, 
2017), and Europe (Christidis and Stott, 2016), found similar results. A clear anthropogenic signal is also 
found in the trends in the Combined Extreme Index (CEI) for North America, Asia, Australia, and Europe 
(Dittus et al., 2016). While various studies have described increasing trends in several heat wave metrics 
(HWD, HWA, EHF, etc.) in different regions (e.g., Bandyopadhyay et al., 2016; Cowan et al., 2014; 
Sanderson et al., 2017), few recent studies have explicitly attributed these changes to causes; most of them 
stated that observed trends are consistent with anthropogenic warming. The detected anthropogenic signals 
are clearly separable from the response to natural forcing, and the results are generally insensitive to the use 
of different model samples, as well as different data availability, indicating robust attribution. Studies of 
monthly, seasonal, and annual records in various regions (Kendon, 2014; Lewis and King, 2015; Bador et al., 
2016; Meehl et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2019a) and globally (King, 2017) show an increase in the breaking of 
hot records and a decrease in the breaking of cold records (King, 2017). Changes in anthropogenically-
attributable record-breaking rates are noted to be largest over the Northern Hemisphere land areas (Shiogama 
et al., 2016). Yin and Sun (2018) found clear evidence of an anthropogenic signal in the changes in the 
number of frost and icing days, when multiple model simulations were used. In some key wheat-producing 
regions of southern Australia, increases in frost days or frost season length have been reported (Dittus et al., 
2014; Crimp et al., 2016); these changes are linked to decreases in rainfall, cloud-cover, and subtropical 
ridge strength, despite an overall increase in regional mean temperatures (Dittus et al., 2014; Pepler et al., 
2018).  
 
A significant advance since AR5 has been a large number of studies focusing on extreme temperature events 
at monthly and seasonal scales, using various extreme event attribution methods. Diffenbaugh et al. (2017) 
found anthropogenic warming has increased the severity and probability of the hottest month over >80% of 
the available observational area on the global scale. Christidis and Stott (2014) provide clear evidence that 
warm events have become more probable because of anthropogenic forcings. Sun et al. (2014) found human 
influence has caused a more than 60-fold increase in the probability of the extreme warm 2013 summer in 
eastern China since the 1950s. Human influence is found to have increased the probability of the historically 
hottest summers in many regions of the world, both in terms of mean temperature (Mueller et al., 2016a) and 
wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) (Li et al., 2017a). In most regions of the Northern Hemisphere, 
changes in the probability of extreme summer average WBGT were found to be about an order of magnitude 
larger than changes in the probability of extreme hot summers estimated by surface air temperature (Li et al., 
2017a). In addition to these generalised, global-scale approaches, extreme event studies have found an 
attributable increase in the probability of hot annual and seasonal temperatures in many locations, including 
Australia (Knutson et al., 2014a; Lewis and Karoly, 2014), China (Sun et al., 2014; Sparrow et al., 2018; 
Zhou et al., 2020), Korea (Kim et al., 2018c) and Europe (King et al., 2015b).  
 
There have also been many extreme event attribution studies that examined short duration temperature 
extremes, including daily temperatures, temperature indices, and heat wave metrics. Examples of these 
events from different regions are summarised in various annual Explaining Extreme Events supplements of 
the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (Peterson et al., 2012, 2013b, Herring et al., 2014, 
2015, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2020), including a number of approaches to examine extreme events (described in 
Easterling et al., 2016; Otto, 2017; Stott et al., 2016). Several studies of recent events from 2016 onwards 
have determined an infinite risk ratio (fraction of attributable risk (FAR) of 1), indicating the occurrence 
probability for such events is close to zero in model simulations without anthropogenic influences (see 
Herring et al., 2018, 2019, 2020; Imada et al., 2019; Vogel et al., 2019). Though it is difficult to accurately 
estimate the lower bound of the uncertainty range of the FAR in these cases (Paciorek et al., 2018), the fact 
that those events are so far outside the envelop of the models with only natural forcing indicates that it is 
extremely unlikely for those events to occur without human influence.  
 
Studies that focused on the attributable signal in observed cold extreme events show human influence 
reducing the probability of those events. Individual attribution studies on the extremely cold winter of 2011 
in Europe (Peterson et al., 2012), in the eastern US during 2014 and 2015 (Trenary et al., 2015, 2016; Wolter 
et al., 2015; Bellprat et al., 2016), in the cold spring of 2013 in the United Kingdom (Christidis et al., 2014), 
and of 2016 in eastern China (Qian et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2018b) all showed a reduced probability due to 
human influence on the climate. An exception is the study of Grose et al. (2018), who found an increase in 
the probability of the severe western Australian frost of 2016 due to anthropogenically-driven changes in 
circulation patterns that drive cold outbreaks and frost probability.  
 
Different event attribution studies can produce a wide range of changes in the probability of event 
occurrence because of different framing. The temperature event definition itself plays a crucial role in the 
attributable signal (Fischer and Knutti, 2015; Kirchmeier‐Young et al., 2019). Large-scale, longer-duration 
events tend to have notably larger attributable risk ratios (Angélil et al., 2014, 2018; Uhe et al., 2016; 
Harrington, 2017; Kirchmeier‐Young et al., 2019), as natural variability is smaller. While uncertainty in the 
best estimates of the risk ratios may be large, their lower bounds can be quite insensitive to uncertainties in 
observations or model descriptions, thus increasing confidence in conservative attribution statements (Jeon et 
al., 2016). 
 
The relative strength of anthropogenic influences on temperature extremes is regionally variable, in part due 
to differences in changes in atmospheric circulation, land surface feedbacks, and other external drivers like 
aerosols. For example, in the Mediterranean and over western Europe, risk ratios on the order of 100 have 
been found (Kew et al., 2019; Vautard et al., 2020a), whereas in the US, changes are much less pronounced. 
This is probably a reflection of the land-surface feedback enhanced extreme 1930s temperatures that reduce 
the rarity of recent extremes, in addition to the definition of the events and framing of attribution analyses 
(e.g., spatial and temporal scales considered). Local forcing may mask or enhance the warming effect of 
greenhouse gases. In India, short-lived aerosols or an increase in irrigation may be masking the warming 
effect of greenhouse gases (Wehner et al., 2018c). Irrigation and crop intensification have been shown to 
lead to a cooling in some regions, in particular in North America, Europe, and India (Mueller et al., 2016b; 
Thiery et al., 2017, 2020; Chen and Dirmeyer, 2019),(high confidence). Deforestation has contributed about 
one third of the total warming of hot extremes in some mid-latitude regions since pre-industrial times 
(Lejeune et al., 2018). Despite all of these differences, and larger uncertainties at the regional scale, nearly 
all studies demonstrated that human influence has contributed to an increase in the frequency or intensity of 
hot extremes and to a decrease in the frequency or intensity of cold extremes.  
 
In summary, long-term changes in various aspects of long- and short-duration extreme temperatures, 
including intensity, frequency, and duration have been detected in observations and attributed to human 
influence at global and continental scales. It is extremely likely that human influence is the main contributor 
to the observed increase in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes and the observed decrease in the 
intensity and frequency of cold extremes on the global scale. It is very likely that this applies on continental 
scales as well. Some specific recent hot extreme events would have been extremely unlikely to occur without 
human influence on the climate system. Changes in aerosol concentrations have affected trends in hot 
extremes in some regions, with the presence of aerosols leading to attenuated warming, in particular from 
1950-1980. Crop intensification, irrigation and no-till farming have attenuated increases in summer hot 
extremes in some regions, such as central North America (medium confidence). 
 
 
## 11.3.5  Projections 
 
AR5 (Chapter12, Collins et al., 2013a) concluded it is virtually certain there will be more frequent hot 
extremes and fewer cold extremes at the global scale and over most land areas in a future warmer climate 
and it is very likely heat waves will occur with a higher frequency and longer duration  . SR15 (Chapter 3, 
Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018) assessment on projected changes in hot extremes at 1.5°C and 2°C global 
warming is consistent with the AR5 assessment, concluding it is very likely a global warming of 2°C, when 
compared with a 1.5°C warming, would lead to more frequent and more intense hot extremes on land, as 
well as to longer warm spells, affecting many densely-inhabited regions. SR15 also assessed it is very likely 
the strongest increases in the frequency of hot extremes are projected for the rarest events, while cold 
extremes will become less intense and less frequent and cold spells will be shorter.  
 
New studies since AR5 and SR15 confirm these assessments. New literature since AR5 includes projections 
of temperature-related extremes in relation to changes in mean temperatures, projections based on CMIP6 
simulations, projections based on stabilized global warming levels, and the use of new metrics. Constraints 
for the projected changes in hot extremes were also provided (Borodina et al., 2017b; Sippel et al., 2017b; 
Vogel et al., 2017). Overall, projected changes in the magnitude of extreme temperatures over land are larger 
than changes in global mean temperature, over mid-latitude land regions in particular (Figures 11.3, 11.11), 
(Fischer et al., 2014; Seneviratne et al., 2016; Sanderson et al., 2017a; Wehner et al., 2018b; Di Luca et al., 
2020a). Large warming in hot and cold extremes will occur even at the 1.5°C global warming level (Figure 
11.11). At this level, widespread significant changes at the grid-box level occur for different temperature 
indices (Aerenson et al., 2018). In agreement with CMIP5 projections, CMIP6 simulations show that a 0.5°C 
increment in global warming will significantly increase the intensity and frequency of hot extremes and 
decrease the intensity and frequency of cold extremes on the global scale (Figures 11.6, 11.8, 11.12). It takes 
less than half of a degree for the changes in TXx to emerge above the level of natural variability (Figure 
11.8) and the 66% ranges of the land medians of the 10-year or 50-year TXx events do not overlap between 
1.0°C and 1.5°C in the CMIP6 multi-model ensemble simulations (Figure 11.6, Li et al., 2020).  
 
<figref>11.11</figref> 
 
Projected warming is larger for TNn and exhibits strong equator-to-pole amplification similar to the warming 
of boreal winter mean temperatures. The warming of TXx is more uniform over land and does not exhibit 
this behaviour (Figure 11.11). The warming of temperature extremes on global and regional scales tends to 
scale linearly with global warming (Section 11.1.4) (Fischer et al., 2014; Seneviratne et al., 2016, 
Wartenburger et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020; see also SR15, Chapter 3). In the mid-latitudes, the rate of 
warming of hot extremes can be as large as twice the rate of global warming (Figure 11.11). In the Arctic 
winter, the rate of warming of the temperature of the coldest nights is about three times the rate of global 
warming (Appendix Figure 11.A.1). Projected changes in temperature extremes can deviate from projected 
changes in annual mean warming in the same regions (Figure 11.3, Figs. 11.A.1 and 11.A.2, Di Luca et al., 
2020a; Wehner, 2020) due to the additional processes that control the response of regional extremes, 
including, in particular, soil moisture-evapotranspiration-temperature feedbacks for hot extremes in the mid-
latitudes and subtropical regions, and snow/ice-albedo-temperature feedbacks in high-latitude regions.  
 
<figref>11.12</figref> 
 
The probability of exceeding a certain hot extreme threshold will increase, while those for cold extreme will 
decrease with global warming (Mueller et al., 2016a; Lewis et al., 2017b; Suarez-Gutierrez et al., 2020b). 
The changes tend to scale nonlinearly with the level of global warming, with larger changes for more rare 
events (Section 11.2.4 and CCB 11.11; Figure. 11.6 and 11.12; e.g. Fischer and Knutti, 2015, Kharin et al., 
2018; Li et al., 2020). For example, the CMIP5 ensemble projects the frequency of the present-day climate 
20-year hottest daily temperature to increase by 80% at the 1.5°C global warming level and by 180% at the 
2.0°C global warming level, and the frequency of the present-day climate 100-year hottest daily temperature 
to increase by 200% and more than 700% at the 1.5°C and 2.0°C warming levels, respectively (Kharin et al., 
2018). CMIP6 simulations project similar changes (Li et al., 2020a). 
 
Tebaldi and Wehner (2018) showed that at the middle of the 21st century, 66% of the land surface area would 
experience the present-day 20-year return values of TXx and the running 3-day average of the daily 
maximum temperature every other year on average under the RCP8.5 scenario, as opposed to only 34% 
under RCP4.5. By the end of the century, these area fractions increase to 92% and 62%, respectively. Such 
nonlinearities in the characteristics of future regional extremes are shown, for instance, for Europe (Lionello 
and Scarascia, 2020;  Spinoni et al., 2018a; Dosio and Fischer, 2018), Asia (Guo et al., 2017; Harrington and 
Otto, 2018b; King et al., 2018), and Australia (Lewis et al., 2017a) under various global warming thresholds. 
The non-linear increase in fixed-threshold indices (e.g., percentile-based for a given reference period or 
based on an absolute threshold) as a function of global warming is consistent with a linear warming of the 
absolute temperature of the temperature extremes (e.g., Whan et al., 2015). Compared to the historical 
climate, warming will result in strong increases in heat wave area, duration, and magnitude (Vogel et al., 
2020b). These changes are mostly due to the increase in mean seasonal temperature, rather than changes in 
temperature variability, though the latter can have an effect in some regions (Di Luca et al., 2020a; Suarez-
Gutierrez et al., 2020a; Brown, 2020). 
 
Projections of temperature-related extremes in RCMs in the CORDEX regions demonstrate robust increases 
under future scenarios and can provide information on finer spatial scales than GCMs (e.g. Coppola et al., 
2021). Five RCMs in the CORDEX-East Asia region project decreases in the 20-year return values of 
temperature extremes (summer maxima), with models that exhibit warm biases projecting stronger warming 
(Park and Min, 2018). Similarly, in the African domain, future increases in TX90p and TN90p are projected 
(Dosio, 2017; Mostafa et al., 2019). This regional-scale analysis provides fine scale information, such as 
distinguishing the increase in TX90p over sub-equatorial Africa (Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola 
and Zambia) with values over the Gulf of Guinea, Central African Republic, South Sudan, and Ethiopia. 
Empirical-statistical downscaling has also been used to produce more robust estimates for future heat waves 
compared to RCMs based on large multi-model ensembles (Furrer et al., 2010; Keellings and Waylen, 2014; 
Wang et al., 2015; Benestad et al., 2018). 
 
In all continental regions, including Africa (Table 11.4), Asia (Table 11.7), Australasia (Table 11.10), 
Central and South America (Table 11.13), Europe (Table 11.16), North America (Table 11.19) and at the 
continental scale, it is very likely the intensity and frequency of hot extremes will increase and the intensity 
and frequency of cold extremes will decrease compared with the 1995-2014 baseline, even under 1.5°C 
global warming, and those changes are virtually certain to occur under 4°C global warming. At the regional 
scale and for almost all AR6 regions, it is likely the intensity and frequency of hot extremes will increase and 
the intensity and frequency of cold extremes will decrease compared with the 1995-2014 baseline, even 
under 1.5°C global warming and those changes will virtually certain to occur under 4°C global warming. 
Exceptions include lower confidence in the projected decrease in the intensity and frequency of cold 
extremes compared with the 1995-2014 baseline under 1.5°C of global warming (medium confidence) and 
4°C of global warming (very likely) in North Central America, Central North America, and Western North 
America. 
 
In Africa (Table 11.4), evidence includes increases in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes, such as 
warm days, warm nights, and heat waves, and decreases in the intensity and frequency of cold extremes, 
such as cold days and cold nights, over the continent as projected by CMIP5, CMIP6, and CORDEX 
simulations (Giorgi et al., 2014; Engelbrecht et al., 2015; Lelieveld et al., 2016; Russo et al., 2016; Dosio, 
2017; Bathiany et al., 2018; Mba et al., 2018; Nangombe et al., 2018; Weber et al., 2018; Kruger et al., 2019; 
Coppola et al., 2021; Li et al., 2020). Cold spells are projected to decrease under all RCPs and even at low 
warming levels in West and Central Africa (Diedhiou et al., 2018) and the number of cold days is projected 
to decrease in East Africa (Ongoma et al., 2018b). 
 
In Asia (Table 11.7), evidence includes increases in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes, such as 
warm days, warm nights, and heat waves, and decreases in the intensity and frequency of cold extremes, 
such as cold days and cold nights, over the continent as projected by CMIP5, CMIP6, and CORDEX 
simulations (Gao et al., 2018; Han et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019b; Pal and Eltahir, 2016; Shin et al., 2018; 
Sillmann et al., 2013b; Singh and Goyal, 2016; Sui et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2015c; Zhao et 
al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2020). More intense heat waves of longer durations and occurring at a 
higher frequency are projected over India (Murari et al., 2015; Mishra et al., 2017) and Pakistan (Nasim et 
al., 2018). Future mid-latitude warm extremes, similar to those experienced during the 2010 event, are 
projected to become more extreme, with temperature extremes increasing potentially by 8.4°C (RCP8.5) 
over northwest Asia (van der Schrier et al., 2018). Over WSB, ESB and RFE, an increase in extreme heat 
durations is expected in all scenarios (Sillmann et al., 2013b; Kattsov et al., 2017; Reyer et al., 2017). In the 
MENA regions (ARP, WCA), extreme temperatures could increase by almost 7°C by 2100 under RCP8.5 
(Lelieveld et al., 2016). 
 
In Australasia (Table 11.10), evidence includes increases in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes, such 
as warm days, warm nights, and heat waves, and decreases in the intensity and frequency of cold extremes, 
such as cold days and cold nights, over the continent as projected by CMIP5, CMIP6, and CORDEX 
simulations (Coppola et al., 2021; Alexander and Arblaster, 2017; CSIRO and BOM, 2015; Herold et al., 
2018; Lewis et al., 2017a; Evans et al., 2020). Over most of Australia, increases in the intensity and 
frequency of hot extremes are projected to be predominantly driven by the long-term increase in mean 
temperatures (Di Luca et al., 2020a). Future projections indicate a decrease in the number of frost days 
regardless of the region and season considered (Alexander and Arblaster, 2017; Herold et al., 2018). 
 
In Central and South America (Table 11.13), evidence includes increases in the intensity and frequency of 
hot extremes, such as warm days, warm nights, and heat waves, and decreases in the intensity and frequency 
of cold extremes, such as cold days and cold nights, over the continent as projected by CMIP5, CMIP6, and 
CORDEX simulations (Chou et al., 2014a; Cabré et al., 2016; López-Franca et al., 2016; Stennett-Brown et 
al., 2017; Li et al., 2020a; Coppola et al., 2021b; Vichot-Llano et al., 2021). Over SES during the austral 
summer, the increase in the frequency of TN90p is larger than that projected for TX90p, consistent with 
observed past changes (López-Franca et al., 2016). Under RCP8.5, the number of heat wave days are 
projected to increase for the intra-Americas region for the end of the 21st century (Angeles-Malaspina et al., 
2018). A general decrease in the frequency of cold spells and frost days is projected as indicated by several 
indices based on minimum temperature (López-Franca et al., 2016). 
 
In Europe (Table 11.16), evidence includes increases in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes, such as 
warm days, warm nights, and heat waves, and decreases in the intensity and frequency of cold extremes, 
such as cold days and cold nights, over the continent as projected by CMIP5, CMIP6, and CORDEX 
simulations (Coppola et al., 2021; Cardoso et al., 2019; Jacob et al., 2018; Lau and Nath, 2014; Lhotka et al., 
2018; Lionello and Scarascia, 2020; Molina et al., 2020; Ozturk et al., 2015; Rasmijn et al., 2018; Russo et 
al., 2015; Schoetter et al., 2015; Suarez-Gutierrez et al., 2018; Vogel et al., 2017; Winter et al., 2017; Li et 
al., 2020). Increases in heat waves are greater over the southern Mediterranean and Scandinavia (Forzieri et 
al., 2016; Abaurrea et al., 2018; Dosio and Fischer, 2018; Rohat et al., 2019). The biggest increases in the 
number of heat wave days are expected for southern European cities (Guerreiro et al., 2018a; Junk et al., 
2019), and Central European cities will see the biggest increases in maximum heat wave temperatures 
(Guerreiro et al., 2018a). 
 
In North America (Table 11.19), evidence includes increases in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes, 
such as warm days, warm nights, and heat waves, and decreases in the intensity and frequency of cold 
extremes, such as cold days and cold nights, over the continent as projected by CMIP5, CMIP6, and 
CORDEX simulations (Li et al., 2020; Coppola et al., 2021; Alexandru, 2018; Grotjahn et al., 2016; Li et al., 
2018a; Vose et al., 2017a; Yang et al., 2018a; Zhang et al., 2019d). Projections of temperature extremes for 
the end of the 21st century show that warm days and nights are very likely to increase and cold days and 
nights are very likely to decrease in all regions. There is medium confidence in large increases in warm days 
and warm nights in summer, particularly over the United States, and in large decreases in cold days in 
Canada in fall and winter (Li et al., 2020; Coppola et al., 2021; Alexandru, 2018; Grotjahn et al., 2016; Li et 
al., 2018a; Vose et al., 2017a; Yang et al., 2018a; Zhang et al., 2019d). Minimum winter temperatures are 
projected to rise faster than mean winter temperatures (Underwood et al., 2017). Projections for the end of 
the century under RCP8.5 showed the 4-day cold spell that happens on average once every 5 years is 
projected to warm by more than 10 ºC and CMIP5 models do not project current 1-in-20 year annual 
minimum temperature extremes to recur over much of the continent (Wuebbles et al., 2014). 
 
In summary, it is virtually certain that further increases in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes and 
decreases in the intensity and frequency of cold extremes will occur throughout the 21st century and around 
the world. It is virtually certain the number of hot days and hot nights and the length, frequency, and/or 
intensity of warm spells or heat waves compared to 1995-2014 will increase over most land areas. In most 
regions, changes in the magnitude of temperature extremes are proportional to global warming levels (high 
confidence). The highest increase of temperature of hottest days is projected in some mid-latitude and semi-
arid regions, at about 1.5 time to twice the rate of global warming (high confidence). The highest increase of 
temperature of coldest days is projected in Arctic regions, at about three times the rate of global warming 
(high confidence). The probability of temperature extremes generally increases non-linearly with increasing 
global warming levels (high confidence). Confidence in assessments depends on the spatial and temporal 
scales of the extreme in question, with high confidence in projections of temperature-related extremes at 
global and continental scales for daily to seasonal scales. There is high confidence that, on land, the 
magnitude of temperature extremes increases more strongly than global mean temperature. 
 
 
# <goto>11.4</goto>  Heavy precipitation 
 
This section assesses changes in heavy precipitation at global and regional scales. The main focus is on 
extreme precipitation at a daily scale where literature is most concentrated, though extremes of shorter (sub-
daily) and longer (five-day or more) durations are also assessed to the extent the literature allows. 
 
 
## 11.4.1  Mechanisms and drivers 
 
SREX (Chapter 3, Seneviratne et al., 2012) assessed changes in heavy precipitation in the context of the 
effects of thermodynamic and dynamic changes. Box 11.1 assesses thermodynamic and dynamic changes in 
a warming world to aid the understanding of changes in observations and projections in some extremes and 
the sources of uncertainties (See also Chapter 8, Section 8.2.3.2). In general, warming increases the 
atmospheric water-holding capacity following the Clausius-Clapeyron (C-C) relation. This thermodynamic 
effect results in an increase in extreme precipitation at a similar rate at the global scale. On a regional scale, 
changes in extreme precipitation are further modulated by dynamic changes (Box 11.1).  
 
Large-scale modes of variability, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), El Niño-Southern 
Oscillation (ENSO), Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV), and Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV) 
(Annex VI), modulate precipitation extremes through changes in environmental conditions or embedded 
storms (Section 8.3.2). Latent heating can invigorate these storms (Nie et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019g); 
changes in dynamics can increase precipitation intensity above that expected from the C-C scaling rate 
(8.2.3.2, Box 11.1, and Section 11.7). Additionally, the efficiency of converting atmospheric moisture into 
precipitation can change as a result of cloud microphysical adjustment to warming, resulting in changes in 
the characteristics of extreme precipitation; but changes in precipitation efficiency in a warming world are 
highly uncertain (Sui et al., 2020). 
 
It is difficult to separate the effect of global warming from internal variability in the observed changes in the 
modes of variability (Section 2.4). Future projections of modes of variability are highly uncertain (Section 
4.3.3), resulting in uncertainty in regional projections of extreme precipitation. Future warming may amplify 
monsoonal extreme precipitation. Changes in extreme storms, including tropical/extratropical cyclones and 
severe convective storms, result in changes in extreme precipitation (Section 11.7). Also, changes in sea 
surface temperatures (SSTs) alter land-sea contrast, leading to changes in precipitation extremes near coastal 
regions. For example, the projected larger SST increase near the coasts of East Asia and India can result in 
heavier rainfall near these coastal areas from tropical cyclones (Mei and Xie, 2016) or torrential rains 
(Manda et al., 2014). The warming in the western Indian Ocean is associated with increases in moisture 
surges on the low-level monsoon westerlies towards the Indian subcontinent, which may lead to an increase 
in the occurrence of precipitation extremes over central India (Krishnan et al., 2016; Roxy et al., 2017).  
 
Decreases in atmospheric aerosols results in warming and thus an increase in extreme precipitation (Samset 
et al., 2018; Sillmann et al., 2019). Changes in atmospheric aerosols also result in dynamic changes such as 
changes in tropical cyclones (Takahashi et al., 2017; Strong et al., 2018). Uncertainty in the projections of 
future aerosol emissions results in additional uncertainty in the heavy precipitation projections of the 21st 
century (Lin et al., 2016).  
 
There has been new evidence of the effect of local land use and land cover change on heavy precipitation. 
There is a growing set of literature linking increases in heavy precipitation in urban centres to urbanization 
(Argüeso et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019f). Urbanization intensifies extreme precipitation, especially in the 
afternoon and early evening, over the urban area and its downwind region (medium confidence) (Box 10.3). 
There are four possible mechanisms: a) increases in atmospheric moisture due to horizontal convergence of 
air associated with the urban heat island effect (Shastri et al., 2015; Argüeso et al., 2016); b) increases in 
condensation due to urban aerosol emissions (Han et al., 2011; Sarangi et al., 2017); c) aerosol pollution that 
impacts cloud microphysics (Schmid and Niyogi, 2017) (Box 8.1); and d) urban structures that impede 
atmospheric motion (Ganeshan and Murtugudde, 2015; Paul et al., 2018; Shepherd, 2013). Other local 
forcing, including reservoirs (Woldemichael et al., 2012), irrigation (Devanand et al., 2019), or large-scale 
land use and land cover change (Odoulami et al., 2019), can also affect local extreme precipitation. 
 
In summary, precipitation extremes are controlled by both thermodynamic and dynamic processes. 
Warming-induced thermodynamic change results in an increase in extreme precipitation, at a rate that 
closely follows the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship at the global scale (high confidence). The effects of 
warming-induced changes in dynamic drivers on extreme precipitation are more complicated, difficult to 
quantify and are an uncertain aspect of projections. Precipitation extremes are also affected by forcings other 
than changes in greenhouse gases, including changes in aerosols, land use and land cover change, and 
urbanization (medium confidence).  
 
 
## 11.4.2  Observed Trends 
 
Both SREX (Chapter 3, Seneviratne et al., 2012) and AR5 (IPCC, 2014 Chapter 2) concluded it was likely 
the number of heavy precipitation events over land had increased in more regions than it had decreased, 
though there were wide regional and seasonal variations, and trends in many locations were not statistically 
significant. This assessment has been strengthened with multiple studies finding robust evidence of the 
intensification of extreme precipitation at global and continental scales, regardless of spatial and temporal 
coverage of observations and the methods of data processing and analysis. 
 
The average annual maximum precipitation amount in a day (Rx1day) has significantly increased since the 
mid-20th century over land (Du et al., 2019; Dunn et al., 2020) and in the humid and dry regions of the globe 
(Dunn et al., 2020). The percentage of observing stations with statistically significant increases in Rx1day is 
larger than expected by chance, while the percentage of stations with statistically significant decreases is 
smaller than expected by chance, over the global land as a whole and over North America, Europe, and Asia 
(Figure 11.13,  Sun et al., 2020) and over global monsoon regions (Zhang and Zhou, 2019) where data 
coverage is relatively good. The addition of the past decade of observational data shows a more robust 
increase in Rx1day over the global land region (Sun et al., 2020). Light, moderate, and heavy daily 
precipitation has all intensified in a gridded daily precipitation data set (Contractor et al., 2020). Daily mean 
precipitation intensities have increased since the mid-20th century in a majority of land regions (high 
confidence, Section 8.3.1.3). The probability of precipitation exceeding 50 mm/day increased during 1961-
2018 (Benestad et al., 2019). The globally averaged annual fraction of precipitation from days in the top 5% 
(R95pTOT) has also significantly increased (Dunn et al., 2020). The increase in the magnitude of Rx1day in 
the 20th century is estimated to be at a rate consistent with C-C scaling with respect to global mean 
temperature (Fischer and Knutti, 2016; Sun et al., 2020). Studies on past changes in extreme precipitation of 
durations longer than a day are more limited, though there are some studies examining long-term trends in 
annual maximum five-day precipitation (Rx5day). On global and continental scales, long-term changes in 
Rx5day are similar to those of Rx1day in many aspects (Zhang and Zhou 2019; Sun et al., 2020). As 
discussed below, at the regional scale, changes in Rx5day are also similar to those of Rx1day where there are 
analyses of changes in both Rx1day and Rx5day.  
 
Overall, there is a lack of systematic analysis of long-term trends in sub-daily extreme precipitation at the 
global scale. Often, sub-daily precipitation data have only sporadic spatial coverage and are of limited 
length. Additionally, the available data records are far shorter than needed for a robust quantification of past 
changes in sub-daily extreme precipitation (Li et al., 2018b). Despite these limitations, there are studies in 
regions of almost all continents that generally indicate intensification of sub-daily extreme precipitation, 
although confidence in an overall increase at the global scale remains very low. Studies include an increase in 
extreme sub-daily rainfall in summer over South Africa (Sen Roy and Rouault, 2013), annually in Australia 
(Guerreiro et al., 2018b), over 23 urban locations in India (Ali and Mishra, 2018), in Peninsular Malaysia 
(Syafrina et al., 2015), and in eastern China in the summer season during 1971-2013 (Xiao et al., 2016). In 
some regions in Italy (Arnone et al., 2013; Libertino et al., 2019) and in the US during 1950-2011 (Barbero 
et al., 2017), there is also an increase. In general, an increase in sub-daily heavy precipitation results in an 
increase in pluvial floods over smaller watersheds (Ghausi and Ghosh, 2020).  
 
There is a considerable body of literature examining scaling of sub-daily precipitation extremes, conditional 
on day-to-day air or dew-point temperatures (Westra et al., 2014; Fowler et al., 2021). This scaling, termed 
apparent scaling (Fowler et al., 2020) is robust when different methodologies are used in different regions, 
ranging between the C-C and two-times the C-C rate (e.g. Burdanowitz et al., 2019; Formayer and Fritz, 
2017; Lenderink et al., 2017). This is confirmed when sub-daily precipitation data collected from multiple 
continents (Lewis et al., 2019a) are analysed in a consistent manner using different methods (Ali et al., 
2021). It has been hoped that apparent scaling might be used to help understand past and future changes in 
extreme sub-daily precipitation. However, apparent scaling samples multiple synoptic weather states, mixing 
thermodynamic and dynamic factors that are not directly relevant for climate change responses (8.2.3.2) 
(Prein et al., 2016b; Bao et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017c; Drobinski et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2019d). The 
spatial pattern of apparent scaling is different from those of projected changes over Australia (Bao et al., 
2017) and North America (Sun et al., 2019) in regional climate model simulations. It thus remains difficult to 
use the knowledge about apparent scaling to infer past and future changes in extreme sub-daily precipitation 
according to observed and projected changes in local temperature.   
 
In Africa (Table 11.5), evidence shows an increase in extreme daily precipitation for the late half of the 20th 
century over the continent where data are available; there is a larger percentage of stations showing 
significant increases in extreme daily precipitation than decreases (Sun et al., 2020). There are increases in 
different metrics relevant to extreme precipitation in various regions of the continent (Chaney et al., 2014; 
Harrison et al., 2019; Dunn et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020). There is an increase in extreme precipitation 
events in southern Africa (Weldon and Reason, 2014; Kruger et al., 2019) and a general increase in heavy 
precipitation over East Africa, the Greater Horn of Africa (Omondi et al., 2014). Over sub-Saharan Africa, 
increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation have been observed over the well-gauged 
areas during 1950-2013; however, this covers only 15% of the total area of sub-Saharan Africa (Harrison et 
al., 2019). Confidence about the increase in extreme precipitation for some regions where observations are 
more abundant is medium, but for Africa as whole, it is low because of a general lack of continent-wide 
systematic analysis, the sporadic nature of available precipitation data over the continent, and spatially non-
homogenous trends in places where data are available (Donat et al., 2014a; Mathbout et al., 2018; Alexander 
et al., 2019; Funk et al., 2020) 
 
In Asia (Table 11.8), there is robust evidence that extreme precipitation has increased since the 1950s (high 
confidence), however this is dominated by high spatial variability. Increases in Rx1day and Rx5day during 
1950-2018 are found over two thirds of stations and the percentage of stations with statistically significant 
trends is significantly larger than can be expected by chance (Sun et al., 2020,  also Fig 11.13). An increase 
in extreme precipitation has also been observed in various regional studies based on different metrics of 
extreme precipitation and different spatial and temporal coverage of the data. These include an increase in 
daily precipitation extremes over central Asia (Hu et al., 2016), most of South Asia (Zahid and Rasul, 2012; 
Pai et al., 2015; Sheikh et al., 2015; Adnan et al., 2016; Malik et al., 2016; Dimri et al., 2017; Priya et al., 
2017; Roxy et al., 2017; Hunt et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2019; Wester et al., 2019), the Arabian Peninsula 
(Rahimi and Fatemi, 2019; Almazroui and Saeed, 2020; Atif et al., 2020), Southeast Asia  (Siswanto et al., 
2015; Supari et al., 2017; Cheong et al., 2018); the northwest Himalaya (Malik et al., 2016), parts of east 
Asia (Nayak et al., 2017; Baek et al., 2017; Ye and Li, 2017), the western Himalayas since the 1950s (Ridley 
et al., 2013; Dimri et al., 2015; Madhura et al., 2015), WSB, ESB and RFE (Donat et al., 2016a) and a 
decrease was found over the eastern Himalayas (Sheikh et al., 2015; Talchabhadel et al., 2018). Increases 
have been observed over Jakarta (Siswanto et al., 2015), but Rx1day over most parts of the Maritime 
Continent has decreased (Villafuerte and Matsumoto, 2015). Trends in extreme precipitation over China are 
mixed with increases and decreases (Fu et al., 2013a; Jiang et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2015; Yin et al., 2015; 
Xiao et al., 2016) and are not significant over China as whole (Li et al., 2018c; Ge et al., 2017; Hu et al., 
2016; Jiang et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2019b; Chen et al., 2021; Deng et al., 2018; He and Zhai, 2018; Tao et al., 
2018). With few exceptions, most Southeast Asian countries have experienced an increase in rainfall 
intensity, but with a reduced number of wet days (Donat et al., 2016a; Cheong et al., 2018; Naveendrakumar 
et al., 2019), though large differences in trends exists if the trends are estimated from different datasets 
including gauge-based, remotely-sensed, and reanalysis over a relatively short period (Kim et al. 2019). 
There is a significant increase in heavy rainfall (>100 mm day-1) and a significant decrease in moderate 
rainfall (5–100 mm day-1) in central India during the South Asian monsoon season (Deshpande et al., 2016; 
Roxy et al., 2017).  
 
In Australasia (Table 11.11), available evidence has not shown an increase or a decrease in heavy 
precipitation over Australasia as a whole (medium confidence), but heavy precipitation tends to increase over 
northern Australia (particularly the northwest) and decrease over the eastern and southern regions (e.g., 
Jakob and Walland, 2016; Dey et al., 2018; Guerreiro et al., 2018; Dunn et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020). 
Available studies that used long-term observations since the mid-20th century showed nearly as many 
stations with an increase as those with a decrease in heavy precipitation (Jakob and Walland, 2016) or 
slightly more stations with a decrease than with an increase in Rx1day and Rx5day (Sun et al., 2020), or 
strong differences in Rx1day trends with increases over northern Australia and central Australia in general 
but mostly decreases over southern Australia and eastern Australia (Dunn et al., 2020). Over New Zealand, 
decreases are observed for moderate-heavy precipitation events, but there are no significant trends for very 
heavy events (more than 64 mm in a day) for the period 1951-2012. The number of stations with an increase 
in very wet days is similar to that with a decrease during 1960-2019 (MfE and Stats NZ, 2020). Overall, 
there is low confidence in trends in the frequency of heavy rain days with mostly decreases over New 
Zealand (Caloiero, 2015; Harrington and Renwick, 2014).  
 
In Central and South America (Table 11.14), evidence shows an increase in extreme precipitation, but in 
general there is low confidence; while continent-wide analyses produced wetting trends, trends are not 
robust. Rx1day increased at more stations than it decreased in South America between 1950-2018 (Sun et al., 
2020). Over 1950-2010, both Rx5day and R99p increased over large regions of South America, including 
NWS, NSA, and SES (Skansi et al., 2013). There are large regional differences. A decrease in daily extreme 
precipitation is observed in northeastern Brazil (Bezerra et al., 2018; Dereczynski et al., 2020; Skansi et al., 
2013). Trends in extreme precipitation indices were not statistically significant over the period 1947-2012 
within the São Francisco River basin in the Brazilian semi-arid region (Bezerra et al., 2018). An increase in 
extreme rainfall is observed in AMZ with medium confidence (Skansi et al., 2013) and in SES with high 
confidence (Ávila et al., 2016; Barros et al., 2015; Lovino et al., 2018; Skansi et al., 2013; Wu and Polvani, 
2017; Dereczynski et al., 2020; Valverde and Marengo, 2014). Among all sub-regions, SES shows the 
highest rate of increase for rainfall extremes, followed by AMZ (Skansi et al., 2013). Increases in the 
intensity of heavy daily rainfall events have been observed in the southern Pacific and in the Titicaca basin 
(Huerta and Lavado-Casimiro, 2020; Skansi et al., 2013). In SCA trends in annual precipitation are generally 
not significant, although small (but significant) increases are found in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Panama 
(Hidalgo et al., 2017). Small positive trends were found in multiple extreme precipitation indices over the 
Caribbean region over a short time period (1986-2010) (Stephenson et al., 2014; McLean et al., 2015) 
 
In Europe (Table 11.17), there is robust evidence that the magnitude and intensity of extreme precipitation 
has very likely increased since the 1950s. There is a significant increase in Rx1day and Rx5day during 1950-
2018 in Europe as whole (Sun et al., 2020, also Figure 11.13). The number of stations with increases far 
exceeds those with decreases in the frequency of daily rainfall exceeding its 90th or 95th percentile in century-
long series (Cioffi et al., 2015). The 5-, 10-, and 20-year events of one-day and five-day precipitation during 
1951-1960 became more common since the 1950s (van den Besselaar et al., 2013). There can be large 
discrepancies among studies and regions and seasons (Croitoru et al., 2013; Willems, 2013; Casanueva et al., 
2014; Roth et al., 2014; Fischer et al., 2015); evidence for increasing extreme precipitation is more 
frequently observed for summer and winter, but not in other seasons (Madsen et al., 2014; Helama et al., 
2018). An increase is observed in central Europe (Volosciuk et al., 2016; Zeder and Fischer, 2020), and in 
Romania (Croitoru et al., 2016). Trends in the Mediterranean region are in general not spatially (Reale and 
Lionello, 2013), with decreases in the western Mediterranean and some increases in the eastern 
Mediterranean (Rajczak et al., 2013; Casanueva et al., 2014; de Lima et al., 2015; Gajić-Čapka et al., 2015; 
Sunyer et al., 2015; Pedron et al., 2017; Serrano-Notivoli et al., 2018; Ribes et al., 2019). In the Netherlands, 
the total precipitation contributed from extremes higher than the 99th percentile doubles per degree C 
increase in warming (Myhre et al., 2019), though extreme rainfall trends in northern Europe may differ in 
different seasons (Irannezhad et al., 2017).  
 
In North America (Table 11.20), there is robust evidence that the magnitude and intensity of extreme 
precipitation has very likely increased since the 1950s. Both Rx1day and Rx5day have significantly increased 
in North America  during 1950-2018 (Sun et al., 2020,  also Figure 11.13). There is, however, regional 
diversity. In Canada, there is a lack of detectable trends in observed annual maximum daily (or shorter 
duration) precipitation (Shephard et al., 2014; Mekis et al., 2015; Vincent et al., 2018).  In the United States, 
there is an overall increase in one-day heavy precipitation, both in terms of intensity and frequency (Sun et 
al., 2020; Donat et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2017; Villarini et al., 2012; Easterling et al., 2017; Wu, 2015; 
Howarth et al., 2019), except for the southern part of the US (Hoerling et al., 2016) where internal variability 
may have played a substantial role in the lack of observed increases. In Mexico, increases are observed in 
R10mm and R95p (Donat et al., 2016a), very wet days over the cities (García-Cueto et al., 2019) and in 
PRCPTOT and Rx1day (Donat et al., 2016b).  
 
In Small Islands, there is a lack of evidence showing changes in heavy precipitation overall. There were 
increases in extreme precipitation in Tobago from 1985–2015 (Stephenson et al., 2014; Dookie et al., 2019) 
and decreases in southwestern French Polynesia and the southern subtropics (low confidence; Atlas.10; Table 
11.5). Extreme precipitation leading to flooding in the small islands has been attributed in part to TCs, as 
well as being influenced by ENSO (Khouakhi et al., 2016; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018) (Box 11.5). 
 
<figref>11.13</figref> 
 
In summary, the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation have likely increased at the global scale over 
a majority of land regions with good observational coverage. Since 1950, the annual maximum amount of 
precipitation falling in a day or over five consecutive days has likely increased over land regions with 
sufficient observational coverage for assessment, with increases in more regions than there are decreases. 
Heavy precipitation has likely increased on the continental scale over three continents, including North 
America, Europe, and Asia where observational data are more abundant. There is very low confidence about 
changes in sub-daily extreme precipitation due to a limited number of studies and the data used in these 
studies are often limited. 
 
 
## 11.4.3  Model evaluation 
 
The evaluation of the skill of climate models to simulate heavy precipitation extremes is challenging due to a 
number of factors, including the lack of reliable observations and the spatial scale mismatch between 
simulated and observed data (Avila et al., 2015, Alexander et al., 2019). Simulated precipitation represents 
areal means, but station-based observations are conducted at point locations and are often sparse. The areal-
reduction factor, the ratio between pointwise station estimates of extreme precipitation and extremes of the 
areal mean, can be as large as 130% at CMIP6 resolutions (~100km) (Gervais et al., 2014). Hence, the order 
in which gridded station based extreme values are constructed (i.e., if the extreme values are extracted at the 
station first and then gridded or if the daily station values are gridded and then the extreme values are 
extracted) represents different spatial scales of extreme precipitation and needs to be taken into account in 
model evaluation (Wehner et al. 2020). This aspect has been considered in some studies. Reanalysis products 
are used in place of station observations for their spatial completeness as well as spatial-scale comparability 
(Sillmann et al., 2013a; Kim et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). However, reanalyses share similar 
parameterizations to the models themselves, reducing the objectivity of the comparison.   
 
Different generations of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) models have improved over 
time, though quite modestly (Flato et al., 2013; Watterson et al., 2014). Improvements in the representation 
of the magnitude of the ETCCDI indices in CMIP5 over CMIP3 (Sillmann et al., 2013a; Chen and Sun, 
2015a) have been attributed to higher resolution as higher-resolution models represent smaller areas at 
individual grid boxes. Additionally, the spatial distribution of extreme rainfall simulated by high-resolution 
models (CMIP5 median resolution ∼ 180 ×96) is generally more comparable to observations (Sillmann et al., 
2013b; Kusunoki, 2017, 2018b; Scher et al., 2017) as these models tend to produce more realistic storms 
compared to coarser models (11.7.2). Higher horizontal resolution alone improves simulation of extreme 
precipitation in some models (Wehner et al., 2014; Kusunoki, 2017, 2018), but this is insufficient in other 
models (Bador et al., 2020) as model parameterization also plays a significant role (Wu et al., 2020a). A 
simple comparison of climatology may not fully reflect the improvements of the new models that have more 
comprehensive formulations of processes (Di Luca et al., 2015). Dittus et al. (2016) found that many of the 
eight CMIP5 models they evaluated reproduced the observed increase in the difference between areas 
experiencing an extreme high (90%) and an extreme low (10%) proportion of the annual total precipitation 
from heavy precipitation (R95p/PRCPTOT) for Northern Hemisphere regions. Additionally, CMIP5 models 
reproduced the relation between changes in extreme and non-extreme precipitation: an increase in extreme 
precipitation is at the cost of a decrease in non-extreme precipitation (Thackeray et al., 2018), a characteristic 
found in the observational record (Gu and Adler, 2018). 
 
CMIP6 models perform reasonably well in capturing large-scale features of precipitation extremes, including 
intense precipitation extremes in the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), and weak precipitation extremes 
in dry areas in the tropical regions (Li et al., 2020) but a double-ITCZ bias over the equatorial central and 
eastern Pacific that appeared in CMIP5 models remains (3.3.2.1). There are also regional biases in the 
magnitude of precipitation extremes (Kim et al., 2020). The models also have difficulties in reproducing 
detailed regional patterns of extreme precipitation such as over the northeast US (Agel and Barlow, 2020), 
though they performed better for summer extremes over the US (Akinsanola et al., 2020). The comparison 
between climatologies in the observations and in model simulations shows that the CMIP6 and CMIP5 
models that have similar horizontal resolutions also have similar model evaluation scores and their error 
patterns are highly correlated (Wehner et al., 2020). In general, extreme precipitation in CMIP6 models tends 
to be somewhat larger than in CMIP5 models (Li et al., 2020a), reflecting smaller spatial scales of extreme 
precipitation represented by slightly higher resolution models (Gervais et al., 2014). This is confirmed by 
Kim et al. (2020), who showed that Rx1day and Rx5day simulated by CMIP6 models tend to be closer to 
point estimates of HadEX3 data (Dunn et al., 2020) than those simulated by CMIP5. Figure 11.14 shows the 
multi-model ensemble bias in mean Rx1day over the period 1979-2014 from 21 available CMIP6 models 
when compared with observations and reanalyses. Measured by global land root mean square error, the 
model performance is generally consistent across different observed/reanalysis data products for the extreme 
precipitation metric (Figure 11.14). The magnitude of extreme area-mean precipitation simulated by the 
CMIP6 models is consistently smaller than the point estimates of HadEX3, but the model values are more 
comparable to those of areal-mean values (Figure 11.14) of the ERA5 reanalysis or REGEN (Contractor et 
al., 2020b). Taylor-plot-based performance metrics reveal strong similarities in the patterns of extreme 
precipitation errors over land regions between CMIP5 and CMIP6 (Srivastava et al., 2020; Wehner et al., 
2020) and between annual mean precipitation errors and Rx1day errors for both generations of models 
(Wehner et al., 2020). 
 
In general, there is high confidence that historical simulations by CMIP5 and CMIP6 models of similar 
horizontal resolutions are interchangeable in their performance in simulating the observed climatology of 
extreme precipitation. 
 
<figref>11.14</figref> 
 
Studies using regional climate models (RCMs), for example, CORDEX (Giorgi et al., 2009) over Africa 
(Dosio et al., 2015; Klutse et al., 2016; Pinto et al., 2016; Gibba et al., 2019), Australia, East Asia (Park et 
al., 2016), Europe (Prein et al., 2016a; Fantini et al., 2018), and parts of North America (Diaconescu et al., 
2018) suggest that extreme rainfall events are better captured in RCMs compared to their host GCMs due to 
their ability to address regional characteristics, for example, topography and coastlines. However, CORDEX 
simulations do not show good skill over south Asia for heavy precipitation and do not add value with respect 
to their GCM source of boundary conditions (Mishra et al., 2014a; Singh et al., 2017b). The evaluation of 
models in simulating regional processes is discussed in detail in Chapter 10 (Section 10.3.3.4). The high-
resolution simulation of mid-latitude winter extreme precipitation over land is of similar magnitude to point 
observations. Simulation of summer extreme precipitation has a high bias when compared with observations 
at the same spatial scale. Simulated extreme precipitation in the tropics also appears to be too large, 
indicating possible deficiencies in the parameterization of cumulus convection at this resolution. Indeed, 
precipitation distributions at both daily and sub-daily time scales are much improved with a convection-
permitting model (Belušić et al., 2020) over west Africa (Berthou et al., 2019b), East Africa (Finney et al., 
2019), North America and Canada (Cannon and Innocenti, 2019; Innocenti et al., 2019) and over Belgium in 
Europe (Vanden Broucke et al., 2019).  
 
In summary, there is high confidence in the ability of models to capture the large-scale spatial distribution of 
precipitation extremes over land. The magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation simulated by 
CMIP6 models are similar to those simulated by CMIP5 models (high confidence).  
 
 
## 11.4.4  Detection and attribution, event attribution 
 
Both SREX (Chapter 3, Seneviratne et al., 2012) and AR5 (Chapter 10, IPCC, 2014) concluded with medium 
confidence that anthropogenic forcing has contributed to a global-scale intensification of heavy precipitation 
over the second half of the 20th century. These assessments were based on the evidence of anthropogenic 
influence on aspects of the global hydrological cycle, in particular, the human contribution to the warming-
induced observed increase in atmospheric moisture that leads to an increase in heavy precipitation, and 
limited evidence of anthropogenic influence on extreme precipitation of durations of one and five days. 
 
Since AR5 there has been new and robust evidence and improved understanding of human influence on 
extreme precipitation. In particular, detection and attribution analyses have provided consistent and robust 
evidence of human influence on extreme precipitation of one- and five-day durations at global to continental 
scales. The observed increases in Rx1day and Rx5day over the Northern Hemisphere land area during 1951-
2005 can be attributed to the effect of combined anthropogenic forcing, including greenhouse gases and 
anthropogenic aerosols, as simulated by CMIP5 models and the rate of intensification with regard to 
warming is consistent with C-C scaling (Zhang et al., 2013). This is confirmed to be robust when an 
additional nine years of observational data and the CMIP6 model simulations were used (Paik et al., 2020; 
CCB3.2, Figure 1). Additionally, the influence of greenhouse gases is attributed as the dominant contributor 
to the observed intensification. The global average of Rx1day in the observations is consistent with 
simulations by both CMIP5 and CMIP6 models under anthropogenic forcing, but not under natural forcing 
(CCB3.2, Figure 1). The observed increase in the fraction of annual total precipitation falling into the top 5th 
or top 1st percentiles of daily precipitation can also be attributed to human influence at the global scale (Dong 
et al., 2020). CMIP5 models were able to capture the fraction of land experiencing a strong intensification of 
heavy precipitation during 1960-2010 under anthropogenic forcing, but not in unforced simulations (Fischer 
et al., 2014)). But the models underestimated the observed trends (Borodina et al., 2017a). Human influence 
also significantly contributed to the historical changes in record-breaking one-day precipitation (Shiogama et 
al., 2016). There is also limited evidence of the influences of natural forcing. Substantial reductions in 
Rx5day and SDII (daily precipitation intensity) over the global summer monsoon regions occurred during 
1957-2000 after explosive volcanic eruptions (Paik and Min, 2018). The reduction in post-volcanic eruption 
extreme precipitation in the simulations is closely linked to the decrease in mean precipitation, for which 
both thermodynamic effects (moisture reduction due to surface cooling) and dynamic effects (monsoon 
circulation weakening) play important roles.  
 
There has been new evidence of human influence on extreme precipitation at continental scales, including 
the detection of the combined effect of greenhouse gases and aerosol forcing on Rx1day and Rx5day over 
North America, Eurasia, and mid-latitude land regions (Zhang et al., 2013) and of greenhouse gas forcing in 
Rx1day and Rx5day in the mid-to-high latitudes, western and eastern Eurasia, and the global dry regions 
(Paik et al., 2020). These findings are corroborated by the detection of human influence in the fraction of 
extreme precipitation in the total precipitation over Asia, Europe, and North America (Dong et al., 2020). 
Human influence was found to have contributed to the increase in frequency and intensity of regional 
precipitation extremes in North America during 1961-2010, based on both optimal fingerprinting and event 
attribution approaches (Kirchmeier-Young and Zhang, 2020). Tabari et al. (2020) found the observed 
latitudinal increase in extreme precipitation over Europe to be consistent with model-simulated responses to 
anthropogenic forcing.  
 
Evidence of human influence on extreme precipitation at regional scales is more limited and less robust. In 
northwest Australia, the increase in extreme rainfall since 1950 can be related to increased monsoonal flow 
due to increased aerosol emissions, but cannot be attributed to an increase in greenhouse gases (Dey et al., 
2019a). Anthropogenic influence on extreme precipitation in China was detected in one study (Li et al., 
2017), but it was not detected in another study (Li et al., 2018e) using different detection and data-processing 
procedures, indicating the lack of robustness in the detection results. A still weak signal-to-noise ratio seems 
to be the main cause for the lack of robustness, as detection would become robust 20 years in the future (Li 
et al., 2018e). Krishnan et al. (2016) attributed the observed increase in heavy rain events (intensity > 100 
mm/day) in the post-1950s over central India to the combined effects of greenhouse gases, aerosols, land use 
and land cover changes, and rapid warming of the equatorial Indian Ocean SSTs. Roxy et al. (2017) and  
Devanand et al. (2019) showed the increase in widespread extremes over the South Asian Monsoon during 
1950-2015 is due to the combined impacts of the warming of the Western Indian Ocean (Arabian Sea) and 
the intensification of irrigation water management over India  
 
Anthropogenic influence may have affected the large-scale meteorological processes necessary for extreme 
precipitation and the localized thermodynamic and dynamic processes, both contributing to changes in 
extreme precipitation events. Several new methods have been proposed to disentangle these effects by either 
conditioning on the circulation state or attributing analogues. In particular, the extremely wet winter of 
2013/2014 in the UK can be attributed, approximately to the same degree, to both temperature-induced 
increases in saturation vapour pressure and changes in the large-scale circulation (Vautard et al., 2016; Yiou 
et al., 2017). There are multiple cases indicating that very extreme precipitation may increase at a rate more 
than the C-C rate (6-7%/ °C) (Pall et al., 2017; Risser and Wehner, 2017; van der Wiel et al., 2017; van 
Oldenborgh et al., 2017;Wang et al., 2018).  
 
Event attribution studies found an influence of anthropogenic activities on the probability or magnitude of 
observed extreme precipitation events, including European winters (Schaller et al., 2016; Otto et al., 2018b), 
extreme 2014 precipitation over the northern Mediterranean (Vautard et al., 2015), parts of the US for 
individual events (Knutson et al., 2014b; Szeto et al., 2015; Eden et al., 2016; van Oldenborgh et al., 2017), 
extreme rainfall in 2014 over Northland, New Zealand (Rosier et al., 2016) or China (Burke et al., 2016; Sun 
and Miao, 2018; Yuan et al., 2018b; Zhou et al., 2018). For other heavy rainfall events, however, studies 
identified a lack of evidence about anthropogenic influences (Imada et al., 2013; Schaller et al., 2014; Otto et 
al., 2015c; Siswanto et al., 2015). There are also studies whose results are inconclusive because of limited 
reliable simulations (Christidis et al., 2013b; Angélil et al., 2016). Overall, both the spatial and temporal 
scales on which extreme precipitation events are defined are important for attribution; events defined on 
larger scales have larger signal-to-noise ratios and thus the signal is more readily detectable. At the current 
level of global warming, there is a strong enough signal to be detectable for large-scale extreme precipitation 
events, but the chance to detect such signals for smaller-scale events becomes smaller (Kirchmeier‐Young et 
al., 2019). 
 
In summary, most of the observed intensification of heavy precipitation over land regions is likely due to 
anthropogenic influence, for which greenhouse gases emissions are the main contributor. New and robust 
evidence since AR5 includes attribution of the observed increase in annual maximum one-day and five-day 
precipitation and in the fraction of annual precipitation due to heavy events to human influence. It also 
includes a larger fraction of land showing enhanced extreme precipitation and a larger probability of record-
breaking one-day precipitation than expected by chance, both of which can only be explained when 
anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing is considered. Human influence has contributed to the intensification 
of heavy precipitation in three continents where observational data are more abundant, including North 
America, Europe and Asia (high confidence). On the spatial scale of AR6 regions, evidence of human 
influence on extreme precipitation is limited, but new evidence is emerging; in particular, studies attributing 
individual heavy precipitation events found that human influence was a significant driver of the events, 
particularly in the winter season.  
 
 
## 11.4.5  Projections 
 
AR5 concluded it is very likely that extreme precipitation events will be more frequent and more intense over 
most of the mid-latitude land masses and wet tropics in a warmer world (Collins et al., 2013). Post-AR5 
studies provide more and robust evidence to support the previous assessments. These include an observed 
increase in extreme precipitation (11.4.3) and human causes of past changes (11.4.4), as well as projections 
based on either GCM and/or RCM simulations. CMIP5 models project the rate of increase in Rx1day with 
warming is independent of the forcing scenario (Pendergrass et al., 2015, Chapter 8, Section 8.5.3.1) or 
forcing mechanism (Sillmann et al., 2017). This is confirmed in CMIP6 simulations (Li et al., 2020, and 
Sillmann et al., 2019). In particular, for extreme precipitation that occurs once a year or less frequently, the 
magnitudes of the rates of change per 1°C change in global mean temperature are similar regardless of 
whether the temperature change is caused by increases in CO2, CH4, solar forcing, or SO4 (Sillmann et al., 
2019). In some models, CESM1 in particular, the extreme precipitation response to warming may follow a 
quadratic relation (Pendergrass et al., 2019). Figure 11.15 shows changes in the 10-year and 50-year return 
values of Rx1day at different warming levels as simulated by the CMIP6 models. The median value of the 
scaling over land, across all SSP scenarios and all models, is close to 7%/°C for the 50-year return value of 
Rx1day. It is just slightly smaller for the 10-year and 50-year return values of Rx5day (Li et al., 2020a). The 
90% ranges of the multi-model ensemble changes across all land grid boxes in the 50-yr return values for 
Rx1day and Rx5day do not overlap between 1.5°C and 2°C warming levels (Li et al., 2020), indicating that a 
small increment such as 0.5°C in global warming can result in a significant increase in extreme precipitation. 
Projected long-period Rx1day return value changes are larger than changes in mean Rx1day and increase 
with increasing rarity (Pendergrass, 2018; Mizuta and Endo, 2020; Wehner, 2020). The rate of change of 
moderate extreme precipitation may depend more on the forcing agent, similar to the mean precipitation 
response to warming (Lin et al., 2016, 2018a). Thus, there is high confidence that extreme precipitation that 
occurs once a year or less frequently increases proportionally to the amount of surface warming and the rate 
of change in precipitation is not dependent on the underlying forcing agents of warming. 
 
<figref>11.15</figref>
 
The spatial patterns of the projected changes across different warming levels are quite similar, as shown in 
Figure 11.16 and confirmed by near-linear scaling between extreme precipitation and global warming levels 
at regional scales (Seneviratne and Hauser, 2020). Internal variability modulates changes in heavy rainfall 
(Wood and Ludwig, 2020), resulting in different changes in different regions (Seneviratne and Hauser, 
2020). Extreme precipitation nearly always increases across land areas with larger increases at higher global 
warming levels, except in very few regions, such as southern Europe around the Mediterranean Basin in 
some seasons. The very likely ranges of the multi-model ensemble changes across all land grid boxes in the 
50-yr return values for Rx1day and Rx5day between 1.5°C and 1°C warming levels are above zero for all 
continents expect Europe, with likely range above zero over Europe (Li et al., 2020). Decreases in extreme 
precipitation are confined mostly to subtropical ocean areas and are highly correlated to decreases in mean 
precipitation due to storm track shifts. These subtropical decreases can extend to nearby land areas in 
individual realizations.  
 
Projected increases in the probability of extreme precipitation of fixed magnitudes are non-linear and show 
larger increases for more rare events (Figures 11.7 and 11.15, Fischer and Knutti, 2015, Li et al., 2020, 
Kharin et al., 2018). CMIP5-model-projected increases in the probability of high (99th and 99.9th) percentile 
precipitation between 1.5°C and 2°C warming scenarios are consistent with what can be expected based on 
observed changes (Fischer and Knutti, 2015), providing confidence in the projections. CMIP5 model 
simulations show that the frequency for present-day climate 20-year extreme precipitation is projected to 
increase by 10% at the 1.5°C global warming level and by 22% at the 2.0°C global warming level, while the 
increase in the frequency for present-day climate 100-year extreme precipitation is projected to increase by 
20% and more than 45% at the 1.5°C and 2.0°C warming levels, respectively (Kharin et al., 2018). CMIP6 
simulations with SSP scenarios show the frequency of 10-year and 50-year events will be approximately 
doubled and tripled, respectively, at a very high warming level of 4°C (Figure 11.7, Li et al., 2020).  
 
The number of studies on the projections of extreme hourly precipitation are limited. The ability of GCMs to 
simulate hourly precipitation extremes is limited (Morrison et al., 2019) and very few modelling centres 
archive sub-daily and hourly precipitation prior to CMIP6 experiments. RCM simulations project an increase 
in extreme sub-daily precipitation in North America (Li et al., 2019a) and over Sweden (Olsson and Foster, 
2013), but these models still do not explicitly resolve convective processes that are important for properly 
simulating extreme sub-daily precipitation. Simulations by RCMs that explicitly resolve convective 
processes (convection-permitting models) are limited in length and only available in a few regions because 
of high computing costs. Yet, a majority of the available convection-permitting simulations project increases 
in the intensities of extreme sub-daily precipitation events with the amount similar to or higher than the C-C 
scaling rate (Ban et al., 2015; Helsen et al., 2020; Kendon et al., 2014, 2019; Prein et al., 2016b; Fowler et 
al., 2020). An increase is projected in extreme sub-daily precipitation over Africa (Kendon et al., 2019); over 
East Africa (Finney et al., 2020) and West Africa (Berthou et al., 2019a; Fitzpatrick et al., 2020), even for 
areas where parameterized RCMs project a decrease; in Europe (Chan et al., 2020 and Hodnebrog et al., 
2019); as well as in the continental US (Prein et al., 2016). Overall, available evidence, while limited, points 
to an increase in extreme sub-daily precipitation in the future. Studies on future changes in extreme 
precipitation for a month or longer are limited. One study projects an increase in extreme monthly 
precipitation in Japan under 4°C global warming for around 80% of stations in the summer (Hatsuzuka and 
Sato, 2019).  
 
In Africa (Table 11.5), extreme precipitation will likely increase under warming levels of 2°C or below 
(compared to pre-industrial values) and very likely increase at higher warming levels. Simulations by 
CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX regional models project an increase in daily extreme precipitation between 
1.5°C and 2.0°C warming levels. The pattern of change in heavy precipitation under different scenarios or 
warming levels is similar with larger increases for higher warming levels (e.g., Nikulin et al., 2018; Li et al., 
2020). With increases in warming, extreme precipitation is projected to increase in the majority of land 
regions in Africa (Mtongori et al., 2016; Pfahl et al., 2017; Diedhiou et al., 2018; Dunning et al., 2018; 
Akinyemi and Abiodun, 2019; Giorgi et al., 2019). Over southern Africa, heavy precipitation will likely 
increase by the end of the 21st century under RCP 8.5 (Dosio, 2016; Pinto et al., 2016; Abiodun et al., 2017; 
Dosio et al., 2019). However, heavy rainfall amounts are projected to decrease over western South Africa 
(Pinto et al., 2018) as a result of a projected decrease in the frequency of the prevailing westerly winds south 
of the continent that translates into fewer cold fronts and closed mid-latitudes cyclones (Engelbrecht et al., 
2009; Pinto et al., 2018). Heavy precipitation will likely increase by the end of the century under RCP8.5 in 
West Africa (Diallo et al., 2016; Dosio, 2016; Sylla et al., 2016; Abiodun et al., 2017; Akinsanola and Zhou, 
2018; Dosio et al., 2019) and is projected to increase (medium confidence) in central Africa (Fotso-Nguemo 
et al., 2018, 2019; Sonkoué et al., 2019) and eastern Africa (Thiery et al., 2016; Ongoma et al., 2018a). In 
northeast and central east Africa, extreme precipitation intensity is projected to increase across CMIP5, 
CMIP6 and CORDEX-CORE (high confidence) in most areas annually (Coppola et al., 2021a), but the 
trends differ from season to season in all future scenarios (Dosio et al., 2019). In northern Africa, there is low 
confidence in the projected changes in heavy precipitation, either due to a lack of agreement among studies 
on the sign of changes (Sillmann et al., 2013a; Giorgi et al., 2014) or due to insufficient evidence.  
 
In Asia (Table 11.8), extreme precipitation will likely increase at global warming levels of 2°C and below, 
but very likely increase at higher warming levels for the region as whole. The CMIP6 multi-model median 
projects an increase in the 10- and 50-yr return values of Rx1day and Rx5day over more than 95% of 
regions, even at the 2°C warming level, with larger increases at higher warming levels, independent of 
emission scenarios (Li et al., 2020, also Figure 11.7). CMIP5 models produced similar projections. Both 
heavy rainfall and rainfall intensity are projected to increase (Endo et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2016, 2018; Han 
et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2014). A half-degree difference in warming 
between the 1.5°C and 2.0°C warming levels can result in a detectable increase in extreme precipitation over 
the region (Li et al., 2020), in the Asian-Australian monsoon region (Chevuturi et al., 2018), and over South 
Asia and China (Lee et al., 2018b; Li et al., 2018f). While there are regional differences, extreme 
precipitation is projected to increase in almost all sub-regions, though there can be spatial heterogeneity 
within sub-regions, such as in India (Shashikanth et al., 2018) and Southeast Asia (Ohba and Sugimoto, 
2019). In East and Southeast Asia, there is high confidence that extreme precipitation is projected to intensify 
(Guo et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018a; Seo et al., 2014; Sui et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017b, 2017c; Xu et al., 
2016; Zhou et al., 2014, Nayak et al., 2017; Mandapaka and Lo, 2018; Raghavan et al., 2018; Tangang et al., 
2018; Supari et al., 2020). Extreme daily precipitation is also projected to increase in South Asia 
(Shashikanth et al., 2018; Han et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2017). The extreme precipitation indices, including 
Rx5day, R95p, and days of heavy precipitation (i.e., R10mm), are all projected to increase under the RCP4.5 
and RCP8.5 scenarios in central and northern Asia (Xu et al., 2017; Han et al., 2018). A general wetting 
across the whole Tibetan Plateau and the Himalaya is projected, with increases in heavy precipitation in the 
21st century (Zhou et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015c; Gao et al., 2018; Palazzi et al., 2013; Rajbhandari et al., 
2015; Wu et al., 2017; Paltan et al., 2018). Agreement in projected changes by different models is low in 
regions of complex topography such as Hindu-Kush-Himalaya (Wester et al., 2019), but CMIP5, CMIP6 and 
CORDEX-CORE simulations consistently project an increase in heavy precipitation in higher latitude areas 
(WSB, ESB, RFE) (Coppola et al., 2021a) (high confidence). 
 
In Australasia (Table 11.11), most CMIP5 models project an increase in Rx1day under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 
scenarios for the late 21st century (CSIRO and BOM, 2015; Alexander and Arblaster, 2017; Grose et al., 
2020) and the CMIP6 multi-model median projects an increase in the 10- and 50-yr return values of Rx1day 
and Rx5day at a rate between 5-6% per degree celsius of near-surface global mean warming (Li et al., 2020, 
also Figure 11.7). Yet, there is large uncertainty in the increase because projected changes in dynamic 
processes lead to a decrease in Rx1day that can offsets the thermodynamic increase over a large portion of 
the region (Pfahl et al., 2017, see also Box 11.1 Figure 1). Projected changes in moderate extreme 
precipitation (the 99th percentile of daily precipitation) by RCMs under RCP8.5 for 2070-2099 are mixed, 
with more regions showing decreases than increases (Evans et al., 2020). It is likely that daily rainfall 
extremes such as Rx1day will increase at the continental scale for global warming levels at or above 3°C, 
daily rainfall extremes are projected to increase at the 2.0°C global warming level (medium confidence), and 
there is low confidence in changes at the 1.5°C. Projected changes show important regional differences with 
very likely increases over NAU (Alexander and Arblaster, 2017; Herold et al., 2018; Grose et al., 2020) and 
NZ (MfE, 2018) where projected dynamic contributions are small (Pfahl et al., 2017), see also Box 11.1 
Figure 1) and medium confidence on increases over central, eastern, and southern Australia where dynamic 
contributions are substantial and can affect local phenomena (CSIRO and BOM, 2015; Pepler et al., 2016; 
Bell et al., 2019; Dowdy et al., 2019).  
 
In Central and South America (Table 11.14), extreme precipitation will likely increase at global warming 
levels of 2°C and below, but very likely increase at higher warming levels for the region as whole. A larger 
increase in global surface temperature leads to a larger increase in extreme precipitation, independent of 
emission scenarios (Li et al., 2020a). But there are regional differences in the projection and projected 
changes for more moderate extreme precipitation are also more uncertain. Extreme precipitation, represented 
by the R50mm and R90p extreme indices, is projected to increase on the eastern coast of SCA, but to decrease 
along the Pacific coasts of El Salvador and Guatemala (Imbach et al., 2018). Chou et al. (2014) and Giorgi et 
al. (2014) projected an increase in extreme precipitation over southeastern South America and the Amazon. 
Projected changes in moderate extreme precipitation represented by the 99th percentile of daily precipitation 
by different models under different emission scenarios, even at high warming levels, are mixed, with 
increases projected for all regions by the CORDEX-CORE and CMIP5 simulations, but increases for some 
regions and decreases for other regions by CMIP6 simulations (Coppola et al., 2021a). Extreme precipitation 
is projected to increase in the La Plata basin (Cavalcanti et al., 2015; Carril et al., 2016). Taylor et al. (2018) 
projected a decrease in days with intense rainfall in the Caribbean under 2°C global warming by the 2050s 
under RCP4.5 relative to 1971-2000.  
 
In Europe (Table 11.17), extreme precipitation will likely increase at global warming levels of 2°C and 
below, but very likely increase for higher warming levels for the region as whole. The CMIP6 multi-model 
median projects an increase in the 10- and 50-yr return values of Rx1day and Rx5day over a majority of the 
region at the 2°C global warming level, with more than 95% of the region showing an increase at higher 
warming levels (Li et al., 2020, also Figure 11.7). The most intense precipitation events observed today in 
Europe are projected to almost double in occurrence for each degree celsius of further global warming 
(Myhre et al., 2019). Extreme precipitation is projected to increase in both boreal winter and summer over 
Europe (Madsen et al., 2014; OB et al., 2015; Nissen and Ulbrich, 2017). There are regional differences, 
with decreases or no change for the southern part of Europe, such as the southern Mediterranean (Lionello 
and Scarascia, 2020;  Tramblay and Somot, 2018; Coppola et al., 2020), uncertain changes over central 
Europe (Argüeso et al., 2012; Croitoru et al., 2013; Rajczak et al., 2013; Casanueva et al., 2014; Patarčić et 
al., 2014; Paxian et al., 2014; Roth et al., 2014; Fischer and Knutti, 2015; Monjo et al., 2016) and a strong 
increase in the remaining parts, including the Alps region (Gobiet et al., 2014; Donnelly et al., 2017), 
particularly in winter (Fischer et al., 2015), and northern Europe. In a 3°C warmer world, there will be a 
robust increase in extreme rainfall over 80% of land areas in northern Europe (Madsen et al., 2014; Donnelly 
et al., 2017; Cardell et al., 2020).   
 
In North America (Table 11.20),  the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation will likely increase at 
the global warming levels of 2°C and below and very likely increase at higher warming levels. An increase is 
projected by CMIP6 model simulations (Li et al., 2020) and by previous model generations (Easterling et al., 
2017; Wu, 2015; Zhang et al. 2018f; Innocenti et al., 2019b), as well as by RCMs (Coppola et al., 2020). 
Projections of extreme precipitation over the southern portion of the continent and over Mexico in particular 
are more uncertain, with decreases possible (Alexandru, 2018; Sillmann et al., 2013b; Coppola et al., 2020).   
 
<figref>11.16</figref> 
 
In summary, heavy precipitation will generally become more frequent and more intense with additional 
global warming. At global warming levels of 4°C relative to the pre-industrial, very rare (e.g., 1 in 10 or 
more years) heavy precipitation events would become more frequent and more intense than in the recent 
past, on the global scale (virtually certain), and in all continents and AR6 regions: The increase in frequency 
and intensity is extremely likely for most continents and very likely for most AR6 regions. The likelihood is 
lower at lower global warming levels and for less-rare heavy precipitation events. At the global scale, the 
intensification of heavy precipitation will follow the rate of increase in the maximum amount of moisture 
that the atmosphere can hold as it warms (high confidence), of about 7% per °C of global warming.The 
increase in the frequency of heavy precipitation events will accelerate with more warming and will be higher 
for rarer events (high confidence), with 10-year and 50-year events to be approximately double and triple, 
respectively, at the 4°C warming level. Increases in the intensity of extreme precipitation events at regional 
scales will depend on the amount of regional warming as well as changes in atmospheric circulation and 
storm dynamics leading to regional differences in the rate of heavy precipitation changes (high confidence). 
 
 
# <goto>11.5</goto>  Floods 
 
Floods are the inundation of normally dry land and are classified into types (e.g., pluvial floods, flash floods, 
river floods, groundwater floods, surge floods, coastal floods) depending on the space and time scales and 
the major factors and processes involved (Chapter 8, Section 8.2.3.2, Nied et al., 2014; Aerts et al., 2018). 
Flooded area is difficult to measure or quantify and, for this reason, many of the existing studies on changes 
in floods focus on streamflow. Thus, this section assesses changes in flow as a proxy for river floods, in 
addition to some types of flash floods. Pluvial and urban floods, types of flash floods resulting from the 
precipitation intensity exceeding the capacity of natural and artificial drainage systems, are directly linked to 
extreme precipitation. Because of this link, changes in extreme precipitation are the main proxy for inferring 
changes in pluvial and urban floods (see also Section 12.4, REF Chapter 12), assuming there is no additional 
change in the surface condition. Changes in these types of floods are not assessed in this section, but can be 
inferred from the assessment of changes in heavy precipitation in Section 11.4. Coastal floods due to extreme 
sea levels and flood changes at regional scales are assessed in Chapter 12 (12.4).  

## 11.5.1  Mechanisms and drivers 
 
Since AR5, the number of studies on understanding how floods may have changed and will change in the 
future has substantially increased. Floods are a complex interplay of hydrology, climate, and human 
management, and the relative importance of these factors is different for different flood types and regions.   
 
In addition to the amount and intensity of precipitation, the main factors for river floods include antecedent 
soil moisture (Paschalis et al., 2014; Berghuijs et al., 2016; Grillakis et al., 2016; Woldemeskel and Sharma, 
2016) and snow water-equivalent in cold regions (Sikorska et al., 2015; Berghuijs et al., 2016). Other factors 
are also important, including stream morphology (Borga et al., 2014; Slater et al., 2015), river and catchment 
engineering (Pisaniello et al., 2012; Nakayama and Shankman, 2013; Kim and Sanders, 2016), land-use and 
land-cover characteristics (Aich et al., 2016; Rogger et al., 2017) and changes (Knighton et al., 2019), and 
feedbacks between climate, soil, snow, vegetation, etc. (Hall et al., 2014; Ortega et al., 2014; Berghuijs et al., 
2016; Buttle et al., 2016; Teufel et al., 2019). Water regulation and management have, in general, increased 
resilience to flooding (Formetta and Feyen, 2019), masking effects of an increase in extreme precipitation on 
flood probability in some regions, even though they do not eliminate very extreme floods (Vicente-Serrano 
et al., 2017). This means that an increase in precipitation extremes may not always result in an increase in 
river floods (Sharma et al., 2018; Do et al., 2020). Yet, as very extreme precipitation can become a dominant 
factor for river floods, there can then be some correspondence in the changes in very extreme precipitation 
and river floods (Ivancic and Shaw, 2015; Wasko and Sharma, 2017; Wasko and Nathan, 2019). This has 
been observed in the western Mediterranean (Llasat et al., 2016), in China (Zhang et al., 2015a) and in the 
US (Peterson et al., 2013a; Berghuijs et al., 2016; Slater and Villarini, 2016). 
 
In regions with a seasonal snow cover, snowmelt is the main cause of extreme river flooding over large areas 
(Pall et al., 2019). Extensive snowmelt combined with heavy and/or long-duration precipitation can cause 
significant floods (Li et al., 2019b; Krug et al., 2020). Changes in floods in these regions can be uncertain 
because of the compounding and competing effects of the responses of snow and rain to warming that affect 
snowpack size: warming results in an increase in precipitation, but also a reduction in the time period of 
snowfall accumulation (Teufel et al., 2019). An increase in atmospheric CO2 enhances water-use efficiency 
by plants (Roderick et al., 2015; Milly and Dunne, 2016; Swann et al., 2016; Swann, 2018); this could 
reduce evapotranspiration and contribute to the maintenance of soil moisture and streamflow levels under 
enhanced atmospheric CO2 concentrations (Yang et al., 2019). This mechanism would suggest an increase in 
the magnitude of some floods in the future (Kooperman et al., 2018). But this effect is uncertain as an 
increase in leaf area index and vegetation coverage could also result in overall larger water consumption 
(Mátyás and Sun, 2014; Mankin et al., 2019; Teuling et al., 2019), and there are also other CO2-related 
mechanisms that come into play (Chapter 5, CC Box 5.1).  
 
Various factors, such as extreme precipitation (Cho et al., 2016; Archer and Fowler, 2018), glacier lake 
outbursts (Schneider et al., 2014; Schwanghart et al., 2016), or dam breaks (Biscarini et al., 2016) can cause 
flash floods. Very intense rainfall, along with a high fraction of impervious surfaces can result in flash floods 
in urban areas (Hettiarachchi et al., 2018). Because of this direct connection, changes in very intense 
precipitation can translate to changes in urban flood potential (Rosenzweig et al., 2018), though there can be 
a spectrum of urban flood responses to this flood potential (Smith et al., 2013), as many factors such as the 
overland flow rate and the design of urban (Falconer et al., 2009) and storm water drainage systems 
(Maksimović et al., 2009) can play an important role. Nevertheless, changes in extreme precipitation are the 
main proxy for inferring changes in some types of flash floods , which are addressed in Chapter 12 (Section 
12.4)), given the relation between extreme precipitation and pluvial floods, the very limited literature on 
urban and pluvial floods (e.g., Skougaard Kaspersen et al., 2017), and limitations of existing methodologies 
for assessing changes in floods (Archer et al., 2016).  
 
In summary, there is not always a one-to-one correspondence between an extreme precipitation event and a 
flood event, or between changes in extreme precipitation and changes in floods, because floods are affected 
by many factors in addition to heavy precipitation (high confidence). Changes in extreme precipitation may 
be used as a proxy to infer changes in some types of flash floods that are more directly related to extreme 
precipitation (high confidence).   
 
 
## 11.5.2  Observed trends 
 
The SREX (Seneviratne et al., 2012) assessed low confidence for observed changes in the magnitude or 
frequency of floods at the global scale. This assessment was confirmed by the AR5 report (Hartmann et al., 
2013). The SR15 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018) found increases in flood frequency and extreme streamflow 
in some regions, but decreases in other regions. While the number of studies on flood trends has increased 
since the AR5 report, and there were also new analyses after the release of SR15 (Berghuijs et al., 2017; 
Blöschl et al., 2019; Gudmundsson et al., 2019), hydrological literature on observed flood changes is 
heterogeneous, focusing at regional and sub-regional basin scales, making it difficult to synthesise at the 
global and sometimes regional scales. The vast majority of studies focus on river floods using streamflow as 
a proxy, with limited attention to urban floods. Streamflow measurements are not evenly distributed over 
space, with gaps in spatial coverage, and their coverage in many regions of Africa, South America, and parts 
of Asia is poor (e.g. Do et al., 2017), leading to difficulties in detecting long-term changes in floods (Slater 
and Villarini, 2017). See also Chapter 8, Section 8.3.1.5. 
 
Peak flow trends are characterized by high regional variability and lack overall statistical significance of a 
decrease or an increase over the globe as a whole. Of more than 3500 streamflow stations in the US, central 
and northern Europe, Africa, Brazil, and Australia, 7.1% stations showed a significant increase and 11.9% 
stations showed a significant decrease in annual maximum peak flow during 1961-2005 (Do et al., 2017). 
This is in direct contrast to the global and continental scale intensification of short-duration extreme 
precipitation (11.4.2). There may be some consistency over large regions (see Gudmundsson et al., 2019), in 
high streamflows (> 90th percentile), including a decrease in some regions (e.g., in the Mediterranean) and an 
increase in others (e.g., northern Asia), but gauge coverage is often limited. On a continental scale, a 
decrease seems to dominate in Africa (Tramblay et al., 2020) and Australia (Ishak et al., 2013; Wasko and 
Nathan, 2019), an increase in the Amazon (Barichivich et al., 2018), and trends are spatially variable in other 
continents (Do et al., 2017; Hodgkins et al., 2017; Bai et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2015b). In Europe, flow 
trends have large spatial differences (Hall et al., 2014; Mediero et al., 2015; Kundzewicz et al., 2018; 
Mangini et al., 2018), but there appears to be a pattern of increase in northwestern Europe and a decrease in 
southern and eastern Europe in annual peak flow during 1960-2000 (Blöschl et al., 2019). In North America, 
peak flow has increased in the northeast US and decreased in the southwest US (Peterson et al., 2013a; 
Armstrong et al., 2014; Mallakpour and Villarini, 2015; Archfield et al., 2016; Burn and Whitfield, 2016; 
Wehner et al., 2017; Neri et al., 2019). There are important changes in the seasonality of peak flows in 
regions where snowmelt dominates, such as northern North America (Burn and Whitfield, 2016; Dudley et 
al., 2017) and northern Europe (Blöschl et al., 2017), corresponding to strong winter and spring warming.  
 
In summary, the seasonality of floods has changed in cold regions where snowmelt dominates the flow 
regime in response to warming (high confidence). Confidence about peak flow trends over past decades on 
the global scale is low, but there are regions experiencing increases, including parts of Asia, southern South 
America, the northeast USA, northwestern Europe, and the Amazon, and regions experiencing decreases, 
including parts of the Mediterranean, Australia, Africa, and the southwestern USA.   
 
 
## 11.5.3  Model evaluation 
 
Hydrological models used to simulate floods are structurally diverse (Dankers et al., 2014; Mateo et al., 
2017; Şen, 2018), often requiring extensive calibration since sub-grid processes and land-surface properties 
need to be parameterized, irrespective of the spatial resolutions (Döll et al., 2016; Krysanova et al., 2017). 
The data that are used to drive and calibrate the models are usually of coarse resolution, necessitating the use 
of a wide variety of downscaling techniques (Muerth et al., 2013). This adds uncertainty not only to the 
models, but also to the reliability of the calibrations. The quality of the flood simulations also depends on the 
spatial scale, as flood processes are different for catchments of different sizes. It is more difficult to replicate 
flood processes for large basins, as water management and water use are often more complex for these 
basins.  
 
Studies that use different regional hydrological models show large spread in flood simulations (Dankers et 
al., 2014; Roudier et al., 2016; Trigg et al., 2016; Krysanova et al., 2017). Regional models reproduce 
moderate and high flows (0.02 – 0.1 flow annual exceedance probabilities) reasonably well, but there are 
large biases for the most extreme flows (0 - 0.02 annual flow exceedance probability), independent of the 
climatic and physiographic characteristics of the basins (Huang et al., 2017)). Global-scale hydrological 
models have even more challenges, as they struggle to reproduce the magnitude of the flood hazard (Trigg et 
al., 2016). Additionally, the ensemble mean of multiple models does not perform better than individual 
models (Zaherpour et al., 2018).  
 
The use of hydrological models for assessing changes in floods, especially for future projections, adds 
another dimension of uncertainty on top of uncertainty in the driving climate projections, including emission 
scenarios, and uncertainty in the driving climate models (both RCMs and GCMs) (Arnell and Gosling, 2016; 
Hundecha et al., 2016; Krysanova et al., 2017). The differences in hydrological models (Roudier et al., 2016; 
Thober et al., 2018), as well as post-processing of climate model output for the hydrological models (Muerth 
et al., 2013; Maier et al., 2018), both add to uncertainty for flood projections.  
 
In summary, there is medium confidence that simulations for the most extreme flows by regional 
hydrological models can have large biases. Global-scale hydrological models still struggle with reproducing 
the magnitude of floods. Projections of future floods are hampered by these difficulties and cascading 
uncertainties, including uncertainties in emission scenarios and the climate models that generate inputs.  
 
## 11.5.4  Attribution 
 
There are very few studies focused on the attribution of long-term changes in floods, but there are studies on 
changes in flood events. Most of the studies focus on flash floods and urban floods, which are closely related 
to intense precipitation events (Hannaford, 2015). In other cases, event attribution focused on runoff using 
hydrological models, and examples include river basins in the UK (Schaller et al., 2016; Kay et al., 2018) 
(See Section 11.4.4), the Okavango river in Africa (Wolski et al., 2014), and the Brahmaputra in Bangladesh 
(Philip et al., 2019). Findings about anthropogenic influences vary between different regions and basins. For 
some flood events, the probability of high floods in the current climate is lower than in a climate without an 
anthropogenic influence (Wolski et al., 2014), while in other cases anthropogenic influence leads to more 
intense floods (Cho et al., 2016; Pall et al., 2017; van der Wiel et al., 2017; Philip et al., 2018a; Teufel et al., 
2019). Factors such as land cover change and river management can also increase the probability of high 
floods (Ji et al., 2020). These, along with model uncertainties and the lack of studies overall, suggest a low 
confidence in general statements to attribute changes in flood events to anthropogenic climate change. Some 
individual regions have been well studied, which allows for high confidence in the attribution of increased 
flooding in these cases (Section 11.9 table). For example, flooding in the UK following increased winter 
precipitation (Schaller et al., 2016; Kay et al., 2018) can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change 
(Schaller et al., 2016; Vautard et al., 2016; Yiou et al., 2017; Otto et al., 2018b).  
 
Attributing changes in heavy precipitation to anthropogenic activities (Section 11.4.4) cannot be readily 
translated to attributing changes in floods to human activities, because precipitation is only one of the 
multiple factors, albeit an important one, that affect floods. For example, Teufel et al. (2017) showed that 
while human influence increased the odds of the flood-producing rainfall for the 2013 Alberta flood in 
Canada, it was not detected to have influenced the probability of the flood itself. Schaller et al. (2016) 
showed human influence on the increase in the probability of heavy precipitation translated linearly into an 
increase in the resulting river flow of the Thames in winter 2014, but its contribution to the inundation was 
inconclusive.  
 
Gudmundsson et al. (2021) compared the spatial pattern of the observed regional trends in high river flows 
(> 90th percentile) over 1971-2010 with those simulated by global hydrological models driven by outputs of 
climate models under all historical forcing and with pre-industrial climate model simulations. They found 
complex spatial patterns of extreme river flow trends. They also found the observed spatial patterns of trends 
can be reproduced only if anthropogenic climate change is considered and that simulated effects of water and 
land management cannot reproduce the observed spatial pattern of trends. As there is only one study and 
multiple caveats, including relatively poor observational data coverage, there is low confidence about human 
influence on the changes in high river flows on the global scale.  
 
In summary there is low confidence in the human influence on the changes in high river flows on the global 
scale. Confidence is in general low in attributing changes in the probability or magnitude of flood events to 
human influence because of a limited number of studies and differences in the results of these studies, and 
large modelling uncertainties.  
 
 
## 11.5.5  Future projections  
 
The SREX report (Chapter 3, Seneviratne et al., 2012) stressed the low availability of studies on flood 
projections under different emission scenarios and concluded there was low confidence in projections of 
flood events given the complexity of the mechanisms driving floods at the regional scale. The AR5 WGII 
report (Chapter 3, Jimenez Cisneros et al., 2014) assessed with medium confidence the pattern of future flood 
changes, including flood hazards increasing over about half of the globe (parts of southern and Southeast 
Asia, tropical Africa, northeast Eurasia, and South America) and flood hazards decreasing in other parts of 
the world, despite uncertainties in GCMs and their coupling to hydrological models. SR15 (Chapter 3, 
Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018) assessed with medium confidence that global warming of 2°C would lead to an 
expansion of the fraction of global area affected by flood hazards, compared to conditions at 1.5°C of global 
warming, as a consequence of changes in heavy precipitation.  
 
The majority of new studies that produce future flood projections based on hydrological models do not 
typically consider aspects that are also important to actual flood severity or damages, such as flood 
prevention measures (Neumann et al., 2015; Şen, 2018), flood control policies (Barraqué, 2017), and future 
changes in land cover (see also Chapter 8, Section 8.4.1.5). At the global scale, Alfieri et al. (2017a) used 
downscaled projections from seven GCMs as input to drive a hydrodynamic model. They found successive 
increases in the frequency of high floods in all continents except Europe, associated with increasing levels of 
global warming (1.5°C, 2°C, 4°C). These results are supported by Paltan et al. (2018), who applied a 
simplified runoff aggregation model forced by outputs from four GCMs. Huang et al. (2018b) used three 
hydrological models forced with bias-adjusted outputs from four GCMs to produce projections for four river 
basins including the Rhine, Upper Mississippi, Upper Yellow, and Upper Niger under 1.5ºC, 2ºC, and 3°C 
global warming. This study found diverse projections for different basins, including a shift towards earlier 
flooding for the Rhine and the Upper Mississippi, a substantial increase in flood frequency in the Rhine only 
under the 1.5ºC and 2°C scenarios, and a decrease in flood frequency in the Upper Mississippi under all 
scenarios.  
 
At the continental and regional scales, the projected changes in floods are uneven in different parts of the 
world, but there is a larger fraction of regions with an increase than with a decrease over the 21st century 
(Hirabayashi et al., 2013; Dankers et al., 2014; Arnell and Gosling, 2016; Döll et al., 2018). These results 
suggest medium confidence in flood trends at the global scale, but low confidence in projected regional 
changes. Increases in flood frequency or magnitude are identified for southeastern and northern Asia and 
India (high agreement across studies), eastern and tropical Africa, and the high latitudes of North America 
(medium agreement), while decreasing frequency or magnitude is found for central and eastern Europe and 
the Mediterranean (high confidence), and parts of South America, southern and central North America, and 
southwest Africa (Hirabayashi et al., 2013; Dankers et al., 2014; Arnell and Gosling, 2016; Döll et al., 2018). 
Over South America, most studies based on global and regional hydrological models show an increase in the 
magnitude and frequency of high flows in the western Amazon (Sorribas et al., 2016; Langerwisch et al., 
2013; Guimberteau et al., 2013; Zulkafli et al., 2016) and the Andes (Hirabayashi et al., 2013; Bozkurt et al., 
2018). Chapter 12, Section 12.4, provides a detailed assessment of regional flood projections.  

In summary,  global hydrological models project a larger fraction of land areas to be affected by an increase 
in river floods than by a decrease in river floods (medium confidence). There is medium confidence that river 
floods will increase in the western Amazon, the Andes, and southeastern and northern Asia. Regional 
changes in river floods are more uncertain than changes in pluvial floods because complex hydrological 
processes and forcings, including land cover change and human water management, are involved. 
 
 
# <goto>11.6</goto>  Droughts 
 
Droughts refer to periods of time with substantially below-average moisture conditions, usually covering 
large areas, during which limitations in water availability result in negative impacts for various components 
of natural systems and economic sectors (Wilhite and Pulwarty, 2017; Ault, 2020). Depending on the 
variables used to characterize it and the systems or sectors being impacted, drought may be classified in 
different types (Figure 8.6; Table 11.A.1) such as meteorological (precipitation deficits), agricultural (e.g., 
crop yield reductions or failure, often related to soil moisture deficits), ecological (related to plant water 
stress that causes e.g., tree mortality), or hydrological droughts (e.g., water shortage in streams or storages 
such as reservoirs, lakes, lagoons, and groundwater) (See Annex VII: Glossary). The distinction of drought 
types is not absolute as drought can affect different sub-domains of the Earth system concomitantly, but 
sometimes also asynchronously, including propagation from one drought type to another (Brunner and 
Tallaksen, 2019). Because of this, drought cannot be characterized using a single universal definition (Lloyd-
Hughes, 2014) or directly measured based on a single variable (SREX Chapter 3; Wilhite and Pulwarty, 
2017). Drought can happen on a wide range of timescales - from "flash droughts" on a scale of weeks, and 
characterized by a sudden onset and rapid intensification of drought conditions (Hunt et al., 2014; Otkin et 
al., 2018; Pendergrass et al., 2020) to multi-year or decadal rainfall deficits (sometimes termed 
“megadroughts”; Annex VII: Glossary) (Ault et al., 2014; Cook et al., 2016b; Garreaud et al., 2017). 
Droughts are often analysed using indices that are measures of drought severity, duration and frequency 
(Table 11.A.1; Chapter 8, Sections 8.3.1.6, 8.4.1.6, Chapter 12, Sections 12.3.2.6 and 12.3.2.7). There are 
many drought indices published in the scientific literature, as also highlighted in the IPCC SREX report 
(SREX Chapter 3). These can range from anomalies in single variables (e.g., precipitation, soil moisture, 
runoff, evapotranspiration) to indices combining different atmospheric variables.  
 
This assessment is focused on changes in physical conditions and metrics of direct relevance to droughts 
(Table 11.A.1): a) precipitation deficits, b) excess of atmospheric evaporative demand (AED), c) soil 
moisture deficits, d) hydrological deficits, and e) atmospheric-based indices combining precipitation and 
AED. In the regional tables (Section 11.9), the assessment is structured by drought types, addressing i) 
meteorological, ii) agricultural and ecological, and iii) hydrological droughts. Note that the latter two 
assessments are directly informing the Chapter 12 assessment on projected regional changes in these climatic 
impact-drivers (Chapter 12, Section 12.4). The text refers to AR6 regions acronyms (Section 11.9, see 
Chapter 1, Section 1.4.5) when referring to changes in AR6 regions. 
 
 
## 11.6.1  Mechanisms and drivers 
 
Similar to many other extreme events, droughts occur as a combination of thermodynamic and dynamic 
processes (Box 11.1). Thermodynamic processes contributing to drought, which are modified by greenhouse 
gas forcing both at global and regional scales, are mostly related to heat and moisture exchanges and also 
partly modulated by plant coverage and physiology. They affect, for instance, atmospheric humidity, 
temperature, and radiation, which in turn affect precipitation and/or evapotranspiration in some regions and 
time frames. On the other hand, dynamic processes are particularly important to explain drought variability 
on different time scales, from a few weeks (flash droughts) to multiannual (megadroughts). There is low 
confidence in the effects of greenhouse gas forcing on changes in atmospheric dynamic (Chapter 2, Section 
2.4; Chapter 4, Section 4.3.3), and, hence, on associated changes in drought occurrence. Thermodynamic 
processes are thus the main driver of drought changes in a warming climate (high confidence).  

### 11.6.1.1   Precipitation deficits 
 
Lack of precipitation is generally the main factor controlling drought onset. There is high confidence that 
atmospheric dynamics, which varies on interannual, decadal and longer time scales, is the dominant 
contributor to variations in precipitation deficits in the majority of the world regions (Dai, 2013; Seager and 
Hoerling, 2014; Miralles et al., 2014b; Burgman and Jang, 2015; Dong and Dai, 2015; Schubert et al., 2016; 
Raymond et al., 2018; Baek et al., 2019; Drumond et al., 2019; Herrera-Estrada et al., 2019; Gimeno et al., 
2020; Mishra, 2020). Precipitation deficits are driven by dynamic mechanisms taking place on different 
spatial scales, including synoptic processes –atmospheric rivers and extratropical cyclones, blocking and 
ridges (Section 11.7; Sousa et al., 2017), dominant large-scale circulation patterns (Kingston et al., 2015), 
and global ocean-atmosphere coupled patterns such as IPO, AMO and ENSO (Dai and Zhao, 2017). These 
various mechanisms occur on different scales, are not independent, and substantially interact with one 
another. Also regional moisture recycling and land-atmosphere feedbacks play an important role for some 
precipitation anomalies (see below).  
 
There is high confidence that land-atmosphere feedbacks play a substantial or dominant role in affecting 
precipitation deficits in some regions (SREX, Chapter3; Gimeno et al., 2012; Guillod et al., 2015; Haslinger 
et al., 2019; Herrera-Estrada et al., 2019; Koster et al., 2011; Santanello  Jr. et al., 2018; Taylor et al., 2012; 
Tuttle and Salvucci, 2016). The sign of the feedbacks can be either positive or negative, as well as local or 
non-local (Taylor et al., 2012; Guillod et al., 2015; Tuttle and Salvucci, 2016). ESMs tend to underestimate 
non-local negative soil moisture-precipitation feedbacks (Taylor et al., 2012) and also show high variations 
in their representation in some regions (Berg et al., 2017a). Soil moisture-precipitation feedbacks contribute 
to changes in precipitation  in climate model projections in some regions, but ESMs display substantial 
uncertainties in their representation, and there is thus only low confidence in these contributions (Berg et al., 
2017a; Vogel et al., 2017, 2018).  
 
 
### 11.6.1.2   Atmospheric evaporative demand  
 
Atmospheric evaporative demand (AED) quantifies the maximum amount of actual evapotranspiration (ET) 
that can happen from land surfaces if they are not limited by water availability (Table 11.A.1). AED is 
affected by both radiative and aerodynamic components. For this reason, the atmospheric dryness, often 
quantified with the relative humidity or the vapor pressure deficit (VPD), is not equivalent to the AED, as 
other variables are also highly relevant, including solar radiation and wind speed (Hobbins et al., 2012; 
McVicar et al., 2012b; Sheffield et al., 2012). AED can be estimated using different methods (McMahon et 
al., 2013). Methods solely based on air temperature (e.g. Hargreaves, Thornthwaite) usually overestimate it 
in terms of magnitude and temporal trends (Sheffield et al., 2012), in particular in the context of substantial 
background warming. Physically-based combination methods such as the Penman-Monteith equation are 
more adequate and recommended since 1998 by the Food and Agriculture Oganization (Pereira et al., 2015). 
For this reason, the assessment of this chapter, when considering atmospheric-based drought indices, only 
includes AED estimates using the latter (see also Section 11.9). AED is generally higher than ET, since it 
represents an upper bound for it. Hence, an AED increase does not necessarily lead to increased ET (Milly 
and Dunne, 2016), in particular under drought conditions given soil moisture limitation (Bonan et al., 2014; 
Berg et al., 2016; Konings et al., 2017; Stocker et al., 2018). In general, AED is highest in regions where ET 
is lowest (e.g., desert areas), further illustrating the decoupling between the two variables under limited soil 
moisture.  
 
The influence of AED on drought depends on the drought type, background climate, the environmental 
conditions and the moisture availability (Hobbins et al., 2016, 2017; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2020b). This 
influence also includes effects not related to increased ET. Under low soil moisture conditions, increased 
AED increases plant stress, enhancing the severity of agricultural and ecological droughts (Williams et al., 
2013; Allen et al., 2015; McDowell et al., 2016; Grossiord et al., 2020). Moreover, high VPD impacts 
overall plant physiology; it affects the leaf and xylem safety margins, and decreases the sap velocity and 
plant hydraulic conductance (Fontes et al., 2018). VPD also affects the plant metabolism of carbon and if 
prolongued, it may cause plant mortality via carbon starvation (Breshears et al., 2013; Hartmann, 2015). 

Drought projections based exclusively on AED metrics overestimate changes in soil moisture and runoff 
deficits. Nevertheless, AED also directly impacts hydrological drought, as ET from surface waters is not 
limited (Wurbs and Ayala, 2014; Friedrich et al., 2018; Hogeboom et al., 2018; Xiao et al., 2018a), and this 
effect increases under climate change projections (Wang et al., 2018c; Althoff et al., 2020). In addition, high 
AED increases crop water consumptions in irrigated lands (García-Garizábal et al., 2014), contributing to 
intensifying hydrological droughts downstream (Fazel et al., 2017; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2017). 
 
On subseasonal to decadal scales, temporal variations in AED are strongly controlled by circulation 
variability (Williams et al., 2014; Chai et al., 2018; Martens et al., 2018), but thermodynamic processes also 
play a fundamental role and under human-induced climate change dominate the changes in AED. 
Atmospheric warming due to increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations increases AED by means of 
enhanced VPD in the absence of other influences (Scheff and Frierson, 2015). Indeed, because of the greater 
warming over land than over oceans (Chapter 2, Section 2.3.1.1; Section 11.3), the saturation pressure of 
water vapor increases more over land than over oceans; oceanic air masses advected over land thus contain 
insufficient water vapour to keep pace with the greater increase in saturation vapour pressure over land 
(Sherwood and Fu, 2014; Byrne and O’Gorman, 2018; Findell et al., 2019). Land-atmosphere feedbacks are 
also important in affecting atmospheric moisture content and temperature, with resulting effects on relative 
humidity and VPD (Berg et al., 2016; Haslinger et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2019; Box 11.1). 
 
 
### 11.6.1.3   Soil moisture deficits 
 
Soil moisture shows an important correlation with precipitation variability (Khong et al., 2015; Seager et al., 
2019), but ET also plays a substantial role in further depleting moisture from soils, in particular in humid 
regions during periods of precipitation deficits (Padrón et al., 2020; Teuling et al., 2013). In addition, soil 
moisture plays a role in drought self-intensification under dry conditions in which ET is decreased and leads 
to higher AED (Miralles et al., 2019), an effect that can also contribute to trigger “flash droughts” (Otkin et 
al., 2016, 2018; DeAngelis et al., 2020; Pendergrass et al., 2020). If soil moisture becomes limited, ET is 
reduced, which on one hand may decrease the rate of soil drying, but on the other hand can lead to further 
atmospheric dryness through various feedback loops (Seneviratne et al., 2010; Miralles et al., 2014a, 2019; 
Teuling, 2018; Vogel et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2019b; Liu et al., 2020). The process is complex since 
vegetation cover plays a role in modulating albedo and in providing access to deeper stores of water (both in 
the soil and groundwater), and changes in land cover and in plant phenology may alter ET (Sterling et al., 
2013; Woodward et al., 2014; Frank et al., 2015; Döll et al., 2016; Ukkola et al., 2016; Trancoso et al., 2017; 
Hao et al., 2019; Lian et al., 2020). Snow depth has strong and direct impacts on soil moisture in many 
systems (Gergel et al., 2017; Williams et al., 2020).  
 
Soil moisture directly affects plant water stress and ET. Soil moisture is the primary factor that controls 
xylem hydraulic conductance, i.e. plant water uptake in plants (Sperry et al., 2016; Hayat et al., 2019; Chen 
et al., 2020d). For this reason, soil moisture deficits are the main driver of xylem embolism,  the primary 
mechanism of plant mortality (Anderegg et al., 2012, 2016; Rowland et al., 2015). Also carbon assimilation 
by plants strongly depend on soil moisture (Hartzell et al., 2017), with implications for carbon starvation and 
plant dying if soil moisture deficits are prolongued (Sevanto et al., 2014). These mechanisms explain that 
soil moisture deficits are usually more relevant than AED excess to explain gross primary production 
anomalies and vegetation stress, mostly in sub-humid and semi-arid regions (Stocker et al. 2018; Liu et al., 
2020b). CO2 concentrations are shown to potentially decrease plant ET and increase plant water-use 
efficiency, affecting soil moisture levels, although this effect interacts with other CO2 physiological and 
radiative effects (Section 11.6.5.2; Chapter 5, CC Box 5.1), and has less relevance under low soil moisture 
(Morgan et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2016b; Nackley et al., 2018; Dikšaitytė et al., 2019). ESMs represent both 
surface (ca. 10cm) and total column soil moisture, whereby total soil moisture is of more direct relevance for 
root water uptake, in particular by trees. There is evidence that surface soil moisture projections are 
substantially drier than total soil moisture projections, and may thus overestimate drying of relevance for 
most vegetation (Berg et al., 2017b). 

### 11.6.1.4   Hydrological deficits 
 
Drivers of streamflow and surface water deficits are complex and strongly depend on the hydrological 
system analysed (e.g., streamflows in the headwaters, medium course of the rivers, groundwater, highly 
regulated hydrological basins). Soil hydrological processes, which control the propagation of meteorological 
droughts throughout different parts of the hydrological cycle (Van Loon and Van Lanen, 2012), are spatially 
and temporally complex (Herrera‐Estrada et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2017c) and difficult to quantify (Van 
Lanen et al., 2016; Apurv et al., 2017; Caillouet et al., 2017; Konapala and Mishra, 2017; Hasan et al., 
2019). The physiographic characteristics of the basins also affect how droughts propagate throughout the 
hydrological cycle (Van Loon and Van Lanen, 2012; Van Lanen et al., 2013; Van Loon, 2015; Konapala and 
Mishra, 2020; Valiya Veettil and Mishra, 2020). In addition, the assessment of groundwater deficits is very 
difficult given the complexity of processes that involve natural and human-driven feedbacks and interactions 
with the climate system (Taylor et al., 2013). Streamflow and surface water deficits are affected by land 
cover, groundwater and soil characteristics (Van Lanen et al., 2013; Van Loon and Laaha, 2015; Barker et 
al., 2016; Tijdeman et al., 2018), as well as human activities (water management and demand, damming) and 
land use changes (He et al., 2017; Jehanzaib et al., 2020; Van Loon et al., 2016; Veldkamp et al., 2017; Wu 
et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2019b; Section 11.6.4.3). Finally, snow and glaciers are relevant for water resources in 
some regions. For instance, warming affects snowpack levels (Dierauer et al., 2019; Huning and 
AghaKouchak, 2020), as well as the timing of snow melt, thus potentially affecting the seasonality and 
magnitude of low flows (Barnhart et al., 2016). 
 
 
### 11.6.1.5   Atmospheric-based drought indices 
 
Given difficulties of drought quantification and data constraints, atmospheric-based drought indices 
combining both precipitation and AED have been developed, as they can be derived from meteorological 
data that is available in most regions with few exceptions. These demand/supply indices are not intended to 
be metrics of soil moisture, streamflow or vegetation water stress. Because of their reliance on precipitation 
and AED, they are mostly related to the actual water balance in humid regions, in which ET is not limited by 
soil moisture and tends towards AED. In water-limited regions and in dry periods everywhere, they 
constitute an upper bound for overall water-balance deficits (e.g. of surface waters) but are also related 
to conditions conducive to vegetation stress, particularly under soil moisture limitation (Section 11.6.1.2).  
 
Although there are many atmospheric-based drought indices, two are assessed in this chapter: the Palmer 
Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The 
PDSI has been widely used to monitor and quantify drought severity (Dai et al., 2018), but is affected by 
some constraints (SREX Chapter 3; Mukherjee et al., 2018). Although the calculation of the PDSI is based 
on a soil water budget, the PDSI is essentially a climate drought index that mostly responds to the 
precipitation and the AED (van der Schrier et al., 2013; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2015; Dai et al., 2018). The 
SPEI also combines precipitation and AED, being equally sensitive to these two variables (Vicente-Serrano 
et al., 2015). The SPEI is more sensitive to AED than the PDSI (Cook et al., 2014a; Vicente-Serrano et al., 
2015), although under humid and normal precipitation conditions, the effects of AED on the SPEI are small 
(Tomas-Burguera et al., 2020). Given the limitations associated with temperature-based AED estimates 
(Section 11.6.1.2), only studies using the Penman-Monteith-based SPEI and PDSI (hereafter SPEI-PM and 
PDSI-PM) are considered in this assessment and in the regional tables in Section 11.9. 
 
 
### 11.6.1.6  Relation of assessed variables and metrics for changes in different drought types 
 
This chapter assesses changes in meteorological drought, agricultural and ecological droughts, and 
hydrological droughts. Precipitation-based indices are used for the estimation of changes in meteorological 
droughts, such as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Consecutive Dry Days (CDD). Changes 
in total soil moisture and soil moisture-based drought events are used for the estimation of changes in 
agricultural and ecological droughts, complemented by changes in surface soil moisture, water-balance 
estimates (precipitation minus ET), and SPEI-PM and PDSI-PM. For hydrological droughts, changes in low 
flows are assessed, sometimes complemented by changes in mean streamflow. 
 
In summary, different drought types exist and they are associated with different impacts and respond 
differently to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. Precipitation deficits and changes in 
evapotranspiration govern net water availability. A lack of sufficient soil moisture, sometimes amplified by 
increased atmospheric evaporative demand, result in agricultural and ecological drought. Lack of runoff and 
surface water result in hydrological drought. Drought events are both the result of dynamic and/or 
thermodynamic processes, with thermodynamic processes being the main driver of drought changes under 
human-induced climate change (high confidence).  
 
 
## 11.6.2  Observed trends 
 
Evidence on observed drought trends at the time of the SREX (Chapter 3) and AR5 (Chapter 2) was limited. 
SREX concluded that “There is medium confidence that since the 1950s some regions of the world have 
experienced a trend to more intense and longer droughts, in particular in southern Europe and West Africa, 
but in some regions droughts have become less frequent, less intense, or shorter, for example, in central 
North America and northwestern Australia”. The assessment at the time did not distinguish between different 
drought types. This chapter includes numerous updates on observed drought trends, associated with 
extensive new literature and longer datasets since the AR5.  
 
 
### 11.6.2.1   Precipitation deficits 
 
Strong precipitation deficits have been recorded in recent decades in the Amazon (2005, 2010), southwestern 
China (2009-2010), southwestern North America (2011-2014), Australia (1997-2009), California (2014), the 
middle East (2012-2016), Chile (2010-2015), the Great Horn of Africa (2011), among others (van Dijk et al., 
2013; Mann and Gleick, 2015; Rowell et al., 2015; Marengo and Espinoza, 2016; Dai and Zhao, 2017; 
Garreaud et al., 2017, 2020; Marengo et al., 2017; Brito et al., 2018; Cook et al., 2018). Global studies 
generally show no significant trends in SPI time series (Orlowsky and Seneviratne, 2013; Spinoni et al., 
2014), and in derived drought frequency and severity data (Spinoni et al., 2019), with very few regional 
exceptions (Figure 11.17 and Section 11.9). Long-term decreases in precipitation are found in some AR6 
regions in Africa (CAF, ESAF), and several regions in South America (NES, SAM, SWS, SSA) (Section 
11.9). Evidence of precipitation-based drying trends is also found in Western Africa (WAF), consistent with 
studies based on CDD trends (Chaney et al., 2014; Donat et al., 2014b; Barry et al., 2018; Dunn et al., 
2020)(Figure 11.17), however there is a partial recovery of the rainfall trends since the 1980s in this region 
(Chapter 10, 10.4.2.1). Some AR6 regions show a decrease in meteorological drought, including NAU, 
CAU, NEU and CNA (Section 11.9). Other regions do not show substantial trends in long-term 
meteorological drought, or display mixed signals depending on the considered time frame and subregions, 
such as in Southern Australia (SAU; Gallant et al., 2013; Delworth and Zeng, 2014; Alexander and 
Arblaster, 2017; Spinoni et al., 2019; Dunn et al., 2020; Rauniyar and Power, 2020) and the Mediterranean 
(MED; Camuffo et al., 2013; Gudmundsson and Seneviratne, 2016; Spinoni et al., 2017; Stagge et al., 2017; 
Caloiero et al., 2018; Peña-Angulo et al., 2020) (see also Section 11.9 and Atlas 8.2). 
 
 
### 11.6.2.2  Atmospheric evaporative demand 
 
In several regions, AED increases have intensified recent drought events (Williams et al., 2014, 2020; Seager 
et al., 2015b; Basara et al., 2019; García-Herrera et al., 2019), enhanced vegetation stress (Allen et al., 2015; 
Sanginés de Cárcer et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2019), or contributed to the depletion of soil moisture or runoff 
through enhanced ET (Teuling et al., 2013; Padrón et al., 2020) (high confidence). Trends in pan evaporation 
measurements and Penman-Monteith AED estimates provide an indication of possible trends in the influence 
of AED on drought. Given the observed global temperature increases (Chapter 2; Section 2.3.1.1; Section 
11.3) and dominant decrease in relative humidity over land areas (Simmons et al., 2010; Willett et al., 2014), 
VPD has increased globally (Barkhordarian et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2019). Pan evaporation has increased as 
a consequence of VPD changes in several AR6 regions such as East Asia (EAS; Li et al., 2013; Sun et al., 
2018; Yang et al., 2018a), West Central Europe (WCE; Mozny et al., 2020), MED; Azorin-Molina et al., 
2015) and Central and Southern Australia (CAU, SAU; Stephens et al., 2018). Nevertheless, there is an 
important regional variability in observed trends, and in other AR6 regions pan evaporation has decreased 
(e.g. in North Central America, NCA (Breña-Naranjo et al., 2016) and in the Tibetan Plateau, TIB (Zhang et 
al., 2018a)). Physical models also show an important regional diversity, with an increase in New Zealand 
(NZ; Salinger, 2013) and the Mediterranean (MED; Gocic and Trajkovic, 2014; Azorin-Molina et al., 2015; 
Piticar et al., 2016), a decrease in SAS (Jhajharia et al., 2015), and strong spatial variability in North 
America (Seager et al., 2015b). This variability is driven by the role of other meteorological variables 
affecting AED. Changes in solar radiation as a consequence of solar dimming and brightening may affect 
trends (Kambezidis et al., 2012; Sanchez-Lorenzo et al., 2015; Wang and Yang, 2014; Chapter 7, Section 
7.2.2.2). Wind speed is also relevant (McVicar et al., 2012a), and studies suggest a reduction of the wind 
speed in some regions (Zhang et al., 2019h) that could compensate the role of the VPD increase. 
Nevertheless, the VPD trend seems to dominate the overall AED trends, compared to the effects of trends in 
wind speed and solar radiation (Wang et al., 2012; Park Williams et al., 2017; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2020b).      
 
 
### 11.6.2.3   Soil moisture deficits 
 
There are limited long-term measurements of soil moisture from ground observations (Dorigo et al., 2011; 
Qiu et al., 2016; Quiring et al., 2016), which impedes their use in the analysis of trends. Among the few 
existing observational studies covering at least two decades, several studies have investigated trends in 
ground soil moisture in East Asia (Section 11.9; (Chen and Sun, 2015b; Liu et al., 2015; Qiu et al., 2016)).   
Alternatively, microwave-based satellite measurements of surface soil moisture have also been used to 
analyse trends (Dorigo et al., 2012; Jia et al., 2018). Although there is regional evidence that microwave-
based soil moisture estimates can capture well drying trends in comparison with ground soil moisture 
observations (Jia et al., 2018), there is only medium confidence in the derived trends, since satellite soil 
moisture data are affected by inhomogeneities (Dorigo et al., 2015; Rodell et al., 2018; Preimesberger et al., 
2020). Furthermore, microwave-based satellites only sense surface soil moisture, which differs from root-
zone soil moisture (Berg et al., 2017b), although relationships can be derived between the two (Brocca et al., 
2011). Several studies have also analysed long-term soil moisture timeseries from observations-driven land-
surface or hydrological models, including land-based reanalysis products (Albergel et al., 2013; Jia et al., 
2018; Gu et al., 2019b; Markonis et al., 2021). Such models have also been used to assess changes in land 
water availability, estimated as precipitation minus ET, which is equal to the sum of soil moisture and runoff 
(Greve et al., 2014; Padrón et al., 2020).  
 
Overall, evidence from global studies suggests that several land regions have been affected by increased soil 
drying or water-balance in past decades, despite some spread among products (Albergel et al., 2013; Greve 
et al., 2014; Gu et al., 2019b; Padrón et al., 2020). Drying has not only occurred in dry regions, but also in 
humid regions (Greve et al., 2014). Some studies have specifically addressed changes in soil moisture at 
regional scale (Section 11.9). For AR6 regions, several studies suggest an increase in the frequency and areal 
extent of soil moisture deficits, with examples in East Asia (EAS; Cheng et al., 2015; Qin et al., 2015; Jia et 
al., 2018), Western and Central Europe (WCE; Trnka et al., 2015b), and the Mediterranean (MED; Hanel et 
al., 2018; Moravec et al., 2019; Markonis et al., 2021). Nonetheless, some analyses also show no long-term 
trends in soil drying in some AR6 regions, e.g. in Eastern (ENA; Park Williams et al., 2017) and Central 
North America (CNA; Seager et al., 2019), as well as in North-Eastern Africa (NEAF; Kew et al., 2021). 
The soil moisture drying trends identified in both global and regional studies are generally related to 
increases in ET (associated with higher AED) rather than decreases in precipitation, as identified on global 
land for trends in water-balance in the dry season (Padrón et al., 2020), as well as for some regions (Teuling 
et al., 2013; Cheng et al., 2015; Trnka et al., 2015a; Van Der Linden et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020c).  
 
Evidence from observed or observations-derived trends in soil moisture and precipitation minus ET, are 
combined with evidence from SPEI and PDSI-PM studies to derive regional assessments of changes in 
agricultural and ecological droughts (Section 11.9). This assessment is summarized in Section 11.6.2.6. 

 
### 11.6.2.4   Hydrological deficits 
 
There is evidence based on streamflow records of increased hydrological droughts in East Asia (Zhang et al., 
2018b) and southern Africa (Gudmundsson et al., 2019). In areas of Western and Central Europe and of 
Northern Europe, there is no evidence of changes in the severity of hydrological droughts since 1950 based 
on flow reconstructions (Caillouet et al., 2017; Barker et al., 2019) and observations (Vicente-Serrano et al., 
2019). In the Mediterranean region, there is high confidence in hydrological drought intensification (Giuntoli 
et al., 2013; Gudmundsson et al., 2019; Lorenzo-Lacruz et al., 2013; Masseroni et al., 2020; Section 11.9). In 
Southeastern South America there is a decrease in the severity of hydrological droughts (Rivera and Penalba, 
2018). In North America, depending on the methods, datasets and study periods, there are differences 
between studies that suggest an increase (Shukla et al., 2015; Udall and Overpeck, 2017) vs a decrease in 
hydrological drought frequency (Mo and Lettenmaier, 2018), but in general there is strong spatial variability 
(Poshtiri and Pal, 2016). Streamflow observation reference networks of near-natural catchments have also 
been used to isolate the effect of climate trends on hydrological drought trends in a few regions, but these 
show limited trends in Northern Europe and Western and Central Europe (Stahl et al., 2010; Bard et al., 
2015; Harrigan et al., 2018), North America (Dudley et al., 2020) and most of Australia with the exception 
of Eastern and Southern Australia (Zhang et al., 2016c). Given the low availability of observations, there are 
few studies analysing trends of drought severity in the groundwater. Nevertheless, some studies suggest a 
noticeable response of groundwater droughts to climate variability (Lorenzo-Lacruz et al., 2017) and 
increased drought frequency and severity associated with warming, probably as a consequence of enhanced 
ET induced by higher AED (Maxwell and Condon, 2016). This is supported by studies in Northern Europe 
(Bloomfield et al., 2019) and North America (Condon et al., 2020). 
 
 
### 11.6.2.5  Atmospheric-based drought indices 
 
Globally, trends in SPEI-PM and PDSI-PM suggest slightly higher increases of drought frequency and 
severity in regions affected by drying over the last decades in comparison to the SPI (Dai and Zhao, 2017; 
Spinoni et al., 2019; Song et al., 2020), mainly in regions of West and Southern Africa, the Mediterranean 
and East Asia (Figure 11.17), which is consistent with observed soil moisture trends (Section 11.6.2.3). 
These indices suggest that AED has contributed to increase the severity of agricultural and ecological 
droughts compared to meteorological droughts (García-Herrera et al., 2019; Williams et al., 2020), reduce 
soil moisture during the dry season (Padrón et al., 2020), increase plant water stress (Allen et al., 2015; 
Grossiord et al., 2020; Solander et al., 2020) and trigger more severe forest fires (Abatzoglou and Williams, 
2016; Turco et al., 2019; Nolan et al., 2020). A number of regional studies based on these drought indices 
have also shown stronger drying trends in comparison to trends in precipitation-based indices in the 
following AR6 regions (see also 11.9): NSA (Fu et al., 2013b; Marengo and Espinoza, 2016), SCA (Hidalgo 
et al., 2017), WCA (Tabari and Aghajanloo, 2013; Sharafati et al., 2020), SAS (Niranjan Kumar et al., 
2013), NEAF (Zeleke et al., 2017), WSAF (Edossa et al., 2016), NWN and NEN (Bonsal et al., 2013), EAS 
(Yu et al., 2014; Chen and Sun, 2015b; Li et al., 2020b; Liang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b) and MED 
(Kelley et al., 2015; Stagge et al., 2017; González-Hidalgo et al., 2018; Mathbout et al., 2018a).  
 
<figref>11.17</figref> 
 

### 11.6.2.6   Synthesis for different drought types 
 
Few AR6 regions show observed increases in meteorological drought (Section 11.9), mostly in Africa and 
South America (NES: high confidence; WAF, CAF, ESAF, SAM, SWS, SSA, SAS: medium confidence); a 
few others show a decrease (WSB, ESB, NAU, CAU, NEU, CNA: medium confidence). There are stronger 
signals indicating observed increases in agricultural and ecological drought (Section 11.9), which highlights 
the role of increased ET, driven by increased AED, for these trends (Sections 11.6.2.3, 11.6.2.5). Past 
increases in agricultural and ecological droughts are found on all continents and several regions (WAF, CAF, 
WSAF, ESAF, WCA, ECA, EAS, SAU, MED, WCE, NES: medium confidence), while decreases are found 
only in one AR6 region (NAU: medium confidence). The more limited availability of datasets makes it more 
difficult to assess historical trends in hydrological drought at regional scale (Section 11.9). Increasing (MED: 
high confidence; WAF, EAS, SAU: medium confidence) and decreasing (NEU, SES: medium confidence) 
trends in hydrological droughts have only been observed in a few regions. 
 
In summary, there is high confidence that AED has increased on average on continents, contributing to 
increased ET and resulting water stress during periods with precipitation deficits, in particular during dry 
seasons. There is medium confidence in increases in precipitation deficits in a few regions of Africa and 
South America. Based on multiple evidence, there is medium confidence that agricultural and ecological 
droughts have increased in several regions on all continents (WAF, CAF, WSAF, ESAF, WCA, ECA, EAS, 
SAU, MED, WCE, NES: medium confidence), while there is only medium confidence in decreases in one 
AR6 region (NAU). More frequent hydrological droughts are found in fewer regions (MED: high 
confidence; WAF, EAS, SAU: medium confidence).  
 
 
## 11.6.3  Model evaluation 
 
### 11.6.3.1   Precipitation deficits 
 
ESMs generally show limited performance and large spread in identifying precipitation deficits and 
associated long-term trends in comparison with observations (Nasrollahi et al., 2015). Meteorological 
drought trends in the CMIP5 ensemble showed substantial disagreements compared with observations 
(Orlowsky and Seneviratne, 2013; Knutson and Zeng, 2018) including a tendency to overestimate drying, in 
particular in mid- to high latitudes (Knutson and Zeng, 2018). CMIP6 models display a better performance in 
reproducing long-term precipitation trends or seasonal dynamics in some studies in southern South America 
(Rivera and Arnould, 2020), East Asia (Xin et al., 2020), southern Asia (Gusain et al., 2020), and 
southwestern Europe (Peña-Angulo et al., 2020b), but there is still too limited evidence to allow for an 
assessment of possible differences in performance between CMIP5 and CMIP6. Furthermore, ESMs are 
generally found to underestimate the severity of precipitation deficits and the dry day frequencies in 
comparison to observations (Fantini et al., 2018; Ukkola et al., 2018). This is probably related to 
shortcomings in the simulation of persistent weather events in the mid-latitudes (Chapter 10, Section 
10.3.3.3). In addition, ESMs also show a tendency to underestimate precipitation-based drought persistence 
at monthly to decadal time scales (Ault et al., 2014; Moon et al., 2018). The overall inter-model spread  in 
the projected frequency of precipitation deficits is also substantial (Touma et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2016; 
Engström and Keellings, 2018). Moreover, there are spatial differences in the spread, which is higher in the 
regions where enhanced drought conditions are projected and under high-emission scenarios (Orlowsky and 
Seneviratne, 2013). Nonetheless, some event attribution studies have concluded that droughts at regional 
scales can be adequately simulated by some climate models (Schaller et al., 2016; Otto et al., 2018c). 
 
 
### 11.6.3.2   Atmospheric evaporative demand 
 
There is only limited evidence on the evaluation of AED in state-of-the-art ESMs, which is performed on 
externally computed AED based on model output (Scheff and Frierson, 2015; Liu and Sun, 2016, 2017). An 
evaluation of average AED in 17 CMIP5 ESMs for 1981-1999 based on potential evaporation show that the 
models’ spatial patterns resemble the observations, but that the magnitude of potential evaporation displays 
strong divergence among models globally and regionally (Scheff and Frierson, 2015). The evaluation of 
AED in 12 CMIP5 ESMs with pan evaporation observations in East Asia for 1961-2000 (Liu and Sun, 2016, 
2017) show that the ESMs capture seasonal cycles well, but that regional AED averages are underestimated 
due to biases in the meteorological variables controlling the aerodynamic and radiative components of AED. 
CMIP5 ESMs also show a strong underestimation of atmospheric drying trends compared to reanalysis data 
(Douville and Plazzotta, 2017). 
 
 
### 11.6.3.3   Soil moisture deficits 
 
The performance of climate models for representing soil moisture deficits shows more uncertainty than for 
precipitation deficits since in addition to the uncertainties related to cloud and precipitation processes, there 
is uncertainty related to the representation of complex soil hydrological and boundary-layer processes (Van 
Den Hurk et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2019; Quintana-Seguí et al., 2020). A limitation is also the lack of 
observations, and in particular soil moisture, in most regions (Section 11.6.2.3), and the paucity of land 
surface property data to parameterize land surface models, in particular soil types, soil properties and depth 
(Xia et al., 2015). The spatial resolution of models is an additional limitation since the representation of 
some land-atmosphere feedbacks and topographic effects requires detailed resolution (Nicolai‐Shaw et al., 
2015; Van Der Linden et al., 2019). Beside climate models, also land surface and hydrological models are 
used to derive historical and projected trends in soil moisture and related land water variables (Albergel et 
al., 2013; Cheng et al., 2015; Gu et al., 2019b; Padrón et al., 2020; Markonis et al., 2021; Pokhrel et al., 
2021).   
 
Overall, there are contrasting results on the performance of land surface models and climate models in 
representing soil moisture. Some studies suggest that soil moisture anomalies are well captured by land 
surface models driven with observation-based forcing (Dirmeyer et al., 2006; Albergel et al., 2013; Xia et al., 
2014; Balsamo et al., 2015; Reichle et al., 2017; Spennemann et al., 2020), but other studies report limited 
agreement in the representation of interannual soil moisture variability (Stillman et al., 2016; Yuan and 
Quiring, 2017; Ford and Quiring, 2019) and noticeable seasonal differences in model skill (Xia et al., 2014, 
2015) in some regions. Models with good skill can nonetheless display biases in absolute soil moisture (Xia 
et al., 2014; Gu et al., 2019a), but these are not necessarily of relevance for the simulation of surface water 
fluxes and drought anomalies (Koster et al., 2009). There is also substantial intermodel spread (Albergel et 
al. 2013), particularly for the root-zone soil moisture (Berg et al., 2017b).  
 
Regarding the performance of regional and global climate models, an evaluation of an ensemble of RCM 
simulations for Europe (Stegehuis et al., 2013) shows that these models display too strong drying in early 
summer, resulting in an excessive decrease of latent heat fluxes, with potential implications for more severe 
droughts in dry environments (Teuling, 2018; Van Der Linden et al., 2019). Compared with a range of 
observational ET estimates, CMIP5 models show an overestimation of ET on annual scale, but an ET 
underestimation in boreal summer in many North-Hemisphere mid-latitude regions, also suggesting a 
tendency towards excessive soil drying (Mueller and Seneviratne, 2014), consistent with identified biases in 
soil moisture-temperature coupling (Donat et al., 2018; Vogel et al., 2018; Selten et al., 2020). Land surface 
models used in ESM display a bias in their representation of the sensitivity of interannual land carbon uptake 
to soil moisture conditions, which appears related to a limited range of soil moisture variations compared to 
observations (Humphrey et al., 2018). 
 
For future projections, the spread of soil moisture outputs among different ESMs is more important than 
internal variability and scenario uncertainty, and the bias is strongly related to the sign of the projected 
change (Ukkola et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2019; Selten et al., 2020). CMIP5 ESMs that project more drying and 
warming in mid-latitude regions show a substantial bias in soil moisture-temperature coupling (Donat et al., 
2018; Vogel et al., 2018). Although CMIP6 and CMIP5 simulations for soil moisture changes are overall 
similar, some differences are found in projections in a few regions (Cook et al., 2020)(see also Section 11.9). 

There is still limited evidence to assess whether there are substantial differences in model performance in the 
two ensembles, but improvements in modeling aspects relevant for soil moisture have been reported for 
precipitation (11.6.3.2), and a better performance has been found in CMIP6 for the representation of long-
term trends in soil moisture in the continental USA (Yuan et al., 2021). Despite the mentioned model 
limitations, the representation of soil moisture processes in ESMs uses physical and biological understanding 
of the underlying processes, which can represent well the temporal anomalies associated with temporal 
variability and trends in climate. In summary, there is medium confidence in the representation of soil 
moisture deficits in ESMs and related land surface and hydrological models.  
 
 
### 11.6.3.4   Hydrological deficits 
 
Streamflow and groundwater are not directly simulated by ESMs, which only simulate runoff, but they are 
generallyn represented in hydrological models (Prudhomme et al., 2014; Giuntoli et al., 2015), which are 
typically driven in a stand-alone manner by observed or simulated climate forcing. The simulation of 
hydrological deficits is much more problematic than the simulation of mean streamflow or peak flows 
(Fundel et al., 2013; Stoelzle et al., 2013; Velázquez et al., 2013; Staudinger et al., 2015), since models tend 
to be too responsive to the climate forcing and do not satisfactorily capture low flows (Tallaksen and Stahl, 
2014). Simulations of hydrological drought metrics show uncertainties related to the contribution of both 
GCMs and hydrological models (Bosshard et al., 2013; Giuntoli et al., 2015; Samaniego et al., 2017; Vetter 
et al., 2017), but hydrological models forced by the same climate input data also show a large spread (Van 
Huijgevoort et al., 2013; Ukkola et al., 2018). At the catchment scale, the hydrological model uncertainty is 
higher than both GCM and downscaling uncertainty (Vidal et al., 2016), and the hydrological models show 
issues in representing drought propagation throughout the hydrological cycle (Barella-Ortiz and Quintana 
Seguí, 2019). A study on the evaluation of streamflow droughts in seven global (hydrological and land 
surface) models compared with observations in near-natural catchments of Europe showed a substantial 
spread among models, an overestimation of the number of drought events, and an underestimation of drought 
duration and drought-affected area (Tallaksen and Stahl, 2014).  
 
 
### 11.6.3.5   Atmospheric-based drought indices 
 
A number of studies have analysed the ability of models to capture drought severity and trends based on 
climatic drought indices. Given the limitations of ESMs in reproducing the dynamic of precipitation deficits 
and AED (11.6.3.1, 11.6.3.2), atmospheric-based drought indices derived from ESM data for these two 
variables are also affected by uncertainties and biases. A comparison of historical trends in PDSI-PM for 
1950-2014 derived from CMIP3 and CMIP5 with respective estimates derived from observations (Dai and 
Zhao, 2017) show a similar behaviour at global scale (long-term decrease), but low spatial agreement in the 
trends except in a few regions (Mediterranean, South Asia, northwestern US). In future projections there is 
an important spread in PDSI-PM and SPEI-PM among different models (Cook et al., 2014a).  
 
 
### 11.6.3.6   Synthesis for different drought types 
 
The performance of ESMs used to assessed changes in variables related to meteorological droughts, 
agricultural and ecological droughts, and hydrological droughts, show the presence of biases and 
uncertainties compared to observations, but there is medium confidence in their overall performance for 
assessing drought projections given process understanding. Given the substantial inter-model spread 
documented for all related variables, the consideration of multi-model projections increases the confidence 
of model-based assessments, with only low confidence in assessments based on single models.  
 
In summary, the evaluation of ESMs, land surface and hydrological models for the simulation of droughts is 
complex, due to the regional scale of drought trends, their overall low signal-to-noise ratio, and the lack of 
observations in several regions, in particular for soil moisture and streamflow. There is medium confidence 
in the ability of ESMs to simulate trends and anomalies in precipitation deficits and AED, and also medium 
confidence in the ability of ESMs and hydrological models to simulate trends and anomalies in soil moisture 
and streamflow deficits, on global and regional scales.  
 
 
## 11.6.4  Detection and attribution, event attribution 
 
### 11.6.4.1  Precipitation deficits 
 
There are only two AR6 regions in which there is at least medium confidence that human-induced climate 
change has contributed to changes in meteorological droughts (Section 11.9). In South-western South 
America (SSW), there is medium confidence that human-induced climate change has contributed to an 
increase in meteorological droughts (Boisier et al., 2016; Garreaud et al., 2020), while in Northern Europe 
(NEU), there is medium confidence that it has contributed to a decrease in meteorological droughts 
(Gudmundsson and Seneviratne, 2016) (Section 11.9). In other AR6 regions, there is inconclusive evidence 
in the attribution of long-term trends, but a human contribution to single meteorological events or 
subregional trends has been identified in some instances (Section 11.9; see also below). In the Mediterranean 
(MED) region, some studies have identified a precipitation decline or increase in meteorological drought 
probability for time frames since the early or mid 20th century and a possible human contribution to these 
trends (Hoerling et al., 2012; Gudmundsson and Seneviratne, 2016; Knutson and Zeng, 2018), also on 
subregional scale in Syria from 1930 to 2010 (Kelley et al., 2015). On the contrary, other studies have not 
identified precipitation and meteorological drought trends in the region for the long-term (Camuffo et al., 
2013; Paulo et al., 2016; Vicente‐Serrano et al., 2021) and also from the mid 20th century (Norrant and 
Douguédroit, 2006; Stagge et al., 2017). There is evidence of substantial internal variability in long-term 
precipitation trends in the region (Section 11.6.2.1), which limits the attribution of human influence on 
variability and trends of meteorological droughts from observational records (Kelley et al., 2012; Peña-
Angulo et al., 2020b). In addition, there are important subregional trends showing mixed signals (MedECC, 
2020)(Section 11.9). The evidence thus leads to an assessment of low confidence in the attribution of 
observed short-term changes in meteorological droughts in the region (Section 11.9). In North America, the 
human influence on precipitation deficits is complex (Wehner et al., 2017), with low confidence in the 
attribution of long-term changes in meteorological drought in AR6 regions (Lehner et al., 2018; Section 
11.9). In Africa there is low confidence that human influence has contributed to the observed long-term 
meteorological drought increase in Western Africa (Section 11.9; Chapter 10, Section 10.6.2).  There is low 
confidence in the attribution of the observed increasing trends in meteorological drought in Eastern Southern 
Africa, but evidence that human-induced climate change has affected recent meteorological drought events 
in the region (11.9).  
 
Attribution studies for recent meteorological drought events are available for various regions. In Central and 
Western Europe, a multi-method and multi-model attribution study on the 2015 Central European drought 
did not find conclusive evidence for whether human-induced climate change was a driver of the rainfall 
deficit, as the results depended on model and method used (Hauser et al., 2017). In the Mediterranean region, 
a human contribution was found in the case of the 2014 meteorological drought in the southern Levant based 
on a single-model study (Bergaoui et al., 2015). In Africa, there is some evidence of a contribution of human 
emissions to single meteorological drought events, such as the 2015-2017 southern African drought (Funk et 
al., 2018a; Yuan et al., 2018a; Pascale et al., 2020), and the three-year 2015-2017 drought in the western 
Cape Town region of South Africa (Otto et al., 2018c). An attributable signal was not found in droughts that 
occurred in different years with different spatial extents in the last decade in Northern and Southern East 
Africa (Marthews et al., 2015; Uhe et al., 2017; Otto et al., 2018a; Philip et al., 2018b; Kew et al., 2021). 
However, an attributable increase in 2011 long rain failure was identified (Lott et al., 2013). Further studies 
have attributed some African meteorological drought events to large-scale modes of variability, such as the 
strong 2015 El Niño (Philip et al., 2018; Box 11.4) and increased SSTs overall (Funk et al., 2015b, 2018b). 
Natural variability was dominant in the California droughts of 2011/12-2013/14 (Seager et al., 2015a). In 
Asia, no climate change signal was found in the record dry spell over Singapore-Malaysia in 2014 (Mcbride 
et al., 2015) or the drought in central southwest Asia in 2013/2014 (Barlow and Hoell, 2015). Nevertheless, 
the South East Asia drought of 2015 has been attributed to anthropogenic warming effects (Shiogama et al., 
2020). Recent droughts occurring in South America, specifically in the southern Amazon region in 2010 
(Shiogama et al., 2013) and in Northeast South America in 2014 (Otto et al., 2015) and 2016 (Martins et al., 
2018) were not attributed to anthropogenic climate change. Nevertheless, the central Chile drought between 
2010 and 2018 has been suggested to be partly associated to global warming (Boisier et al., 2016; Garreaud 
et al., 2020). The 2013 New Zealand meteorological drought was attributed to human influence by 
Harrington et al. (2014, 2016) based on fully coupled CMIP5 models, but, no corresponding change in the 
dry end of simulated precipitation from a stand-alone atmospheric model was found by Angélil et al. (2017).      
 
Event attribution studies also highlight a complex interplay of anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic 
climatological factors for some events. For example, anthropogenic warming contributed to the 2014 drought 
in North Eastern-Africa by increasing east African and west Pacific temperatures, and increasing the gradient 
between standardized western and central Pacific SSTs causing reduced rainfall (Funk et al., 2015b). As 
different methodologies, models and data sources have been used for the attribution of precipitation deficits, 
Angélil et al. (2017) reexamined several events using a single analytical approach and climate model and 
observational datasets. Their results showed a disagreement in the original anthropogenic attribution in a 
number of precipitation deficit events, which increased uncertainty in the attribution of meteorological 
droughts events.  
 
 
### 11.6.4.2   Soil moisture deficits 
 
There is a growing number of studies on the detection and attribution of long-term changes in soil moisture 
deficits. Mueller and Zhang (2016) concluded that anthropogenic forcing contributed significantly to an 
increase in the land surface area affected by soil moisture deficits, which can be reproduced by CMIP5 
models only if anthropogenic forcings are involved. A similar assessment was provided globally by Gu et al. 
(2019b) also using CMIP5 models. Padrón et al. (2019) analyzed long-term reconstructed and CMIP5 
simulated dry season water availability, defined as precipitation minus ET (i.e., equivalent to soil moisture 
and runoff availability), and found that patterns of changes in dry-season deficits in the recent three last 
decades can only be explained by anthropogenic forcing and are mostly related to changes in ET. Similarly 
Williams et al. (2020) concluded human-induced climate change contributed to the strong soil moisture 
deficits recorded in the last two decades in western North America through VPD increases associated with 
higher air temperatures and lower air humidity. There are few studies analysing the attribution of particular 
episodes of soil moisture deficits to anthropogenic influence. Nevertheless, the available modeling studies 
coincide in supporting an anthropogenic attribution associated with more extreme temperatures, exacerbating 
AED and increasing ET, and thus depleting soil moisture, as observed in southern Europe in 2017 (García-
Herrera et al., 2019) and in Australia in 2018 (Lewis et al., 2019b) and 2019 (van Oldenborgh et al., 2021), 
the latter event having strong implications in the propagation of widespread mega-fires (Nolan et al., 2020).    
 
 
### 11.6.4.3  Hydrological deficits 
 
It is often difficult to separate the role of climate trends from changes in land use, water management and 
demand for changes in hydrological deficits, especially on regional scale. However, a global study based on 
a recent multi-model experiment with global hydrological models and covering several AR6 regions 
suggests a dominant role of anthropogenic radiative forcing for trends in low, mean and high flows, while 
simulated effects of water and land management do not suffice to reproduce the observed spatial pattern of 
trends (Gudmundsson et al., 2021). Regional studies also suggest that climate trends have been dominant 
compared to land use and human water management for explaining trends in hydrological droughts in some 
regions, for instance in Ethiopia (Fenta et al., 2017), in China (Xie et al., 2015), and in North America for the 
Missouri and Colorado basins, as well as in California (Shukla et al., 2015; Udall and Overpeck, 2017; 
Ficklin et al., 2018; Xiao et al., 2018a; Glas et al., 2019; Martin et al., 2020; Milly and Dunne, 2020). 
 
In other regions the influence of human water uses can be more important to explain hydrological drought 
trends (Liu et al., 2016b; Mohammed and Scholz, 2016). There is medium confidence that human-induced 
climate change has contributed to an increase of hydrological droughts in the Mediterranean (Giuntoli et al., 
2013; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2014; Gudmundsson et al., 2017), but also medium confidence that changes in 
land use and terrestrial water management contributed to these trends as well (Teuling et al., 2019; Vicente-
Serrano et al., 2019; Section 11.9). A global study with a single hydrological model estimated that human 
water consumption has intensified the magnitude of hydrological droughts by 20%-40% over the last 50 
years, and that the human water use contribution to hydrological droughts was more important than climatic 
factors in the Mediterranean, and the central US, as well as in parts of Brazil (Wada et al., 2013). However, 
Gudmundsson et al. (2021) concluded that the contribution of human water use is smaller than that of 
anthropogenic climate change to explain spatial differences in the trends of low flows based on a multi-
model analysis. There is still limited evidence and thus low confidence in assessing these trends at the scale 
of single regions, with few exceptions (Section 11.9). 
 
 
### 11.6.4.4   Atmospheric-based drought indices 
 
Different studies using atmospheric-based drought indices suggest an attributable anthropogenic signal, 
characterized by the increased frequency and severity of droughts (Cook et al., 2018), associated to increased 
AED (Section 11.6.4.2). The majority of studies are based on the PDSI-PM. Williams et al. (2015) and 
Griffin and Anchukaitis (2014) concluded that increased AED has had an increased contribution to drought 
severity over the last decades, and played a dominant role in the intensification of the 2012-2014 drought in 
California. The same temporal pattern and physical mechanism was stressed by Li et al. (2017) in Central 
Asia. Marvel et al. (2019) compared tree ring-based reconstructions of the PDSI-PM over the past 
millennium with PDSI-PM estimates based on output from CMIP5 models, suggesting a contribution of 
greenhouse gas forcing to the changes since the beginning of the 20th century, although characterized with 
temporal differences that could be driven by temporal variations in the aerosol forcing, in agreement with the 
dominant external forcings of aridification at global scale between 1950 and 2014 (Bonfils et al., 2020). In 
the Mediterranean region there is medium confidence of drying attributable to antropogenic forcing as a 
consequence of the strong AED increase (Gocic and Trajkovic, 2014; Liuzzo et al., 2014; Azorin-Molina et 
al., 2015; Maček et al., 2018), which has enhanced the severity of drought events (Vicente-Serrano et al., 
2014; Stagge et al., 2017; González-Hidalgo et al., 2018). In particular, this effect was identified to be the 
main driver of the intensification of the 2017 drought that affected southwestern Europe, and was attributed 
to the human forcing (García-Herrera et al., 2019). Nangombe et al. (2020) and Zhang et al. (2020) 
concluded from differences between precipitation and AED that anthropogenic forcing contributed to  2018 
droughts that affected southern Africa and southeastern China, respectively, principally as consequence of 
the high AED that characterised these two events. 
 
 
### 11.6.4.5   Synthesis for different drought types 
 
The regional evidence on attribution for single AR6 regions generally shows low confidence for a human 
contribution to observed trends in meteorological droughts at regional scale, with few exceptions (Section 
11.9). There is medium confidence that human influence has contributed to changes in agricultural and 
ecological droughts and has led to an increase in the overall affected land area. At regional scales, there is 
medium confidence in a contribution of human-induced climate change to increases in agricultural and 
ecological droughts in the Mediterranean (MED) and Western North America (WNA) (Section 11.9). There 
is medium confidence that human-induced climate change has contributed to an increase in hydrological 
droughts in the Mediterranean region, but also medium confidence in contributions from other human 
influences, including water management and land use (Section 11.9). Several meteorological and agricultural 
and ecological drought events have been attributed to human-induced climate change, even in regions where 
no long-term changes are detected (medium confidence). However, a lack of attribution to human-induced 
climate change has also been shown for some events (medium confidence). 
 
In summary, human influence has contributed to changes in water availability during the dry season over 
land areas, including decreases over several regions due to increases in evapotranspiration (medium 
confidence). The increases in evapotranspiration have been driven by increases in atmospheric evaporative 
demand induced by increased temperature, decreased relative humidity and increased net radiation over 
affected land areas (high confidence). There is low confidence that human influence has affected trends in 
meteorological droughts in most regions, but medium confidence that they have contributed to the severity of 
some single events. There is medium confidence that human-induced climate change has contributed to 
increasing trends in the probability or intensity of recent agricultural and ecological droughts, leading to an 
increase of the affected land area. Human-induced climate change has contributed to global-scale change in 
low flow, but human water management and land use changes are also important drivers (medium 
confidence). 
 
 
## 11.6.5  Projections 
 
SREX (Chapter 3) asssessed with medium confidence projections of increased drought severity in some 
regions, including southern Europe and the Mediterranean, central Europe, Central America and Mexico, 
northeast Brazil, and southern Africa, and. low confidence elsewhere given large inter-model spread. AR5 
(Chapters 11 and 12) also assessed large uncertainties in drought projections at the regional and global 
scales. The assessment of drought mechanisms under future climate change scenarios depends on the model 
used (Section 11.6.3). Moreover, uncertainties in drought projections are affected by the consideration of 
plant physiological responses to increasing atmospheric CO2 (Greve et al., 2019; Mankin et al., 2019; Milly 
and Dunne, 2016; Yang et al., 2020; Chapter 5, Cross-Chapter Box 5.1), the role of soil moisture-atmosphere 
feedbacks for changes in water-balance and aridity (Berg et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2021), and statistical 
issues related to considered drought time scales (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2020a). Nonetheless, the extensive 
literature available since AR5 allows a substantially more robust assessment of projected changes in 
droughts, also subdivided in different drought types (meteorological drought, agricultural and ecological 
drought, and hydrological drought). This includes assessments of projected changes in droughts, including 
changes at 1.5°C, 2°C and 4°C of global warming, for all AR6 regions (Section 11.9). Projected changes 
show increases in drought frequency and intensity in several regions as function of global warming (high 
confidence). There are also substantial increases in drought hazard probability from 1.5°C to 2°C global 
warming as well as for further additional increments of global warming (Figs. 11.18 and 11.19) (high 
confidence). These findings are based both on CMIP5 and CMIP6 analyses (Section 11.9; Greve et al., 2018; 
Wartenburger et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2019a), and strengthen the conclusions of the SR15 Ch3.   
 
 
### 11.6.5.1  Precipitation deficits 
 
Studies based on CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX projections show a consistent signal in the sign and spatial 
pattern of projections of precipitation deficits. Global studies based on these multi-model ensemble 
projections (Orlowsky and Seneviratne, 2013; Martin, 2018; Spinoni et al., 2020; Ukkola et al., 2020; 
Coppola et al., 2021b) show particularly strong signal-to-noise ratios for increasing meteorological droughts  
in the following AR6 regions: MED, ESAF, WSAF, SAU, CAU, NCA, SCA, NSA and NES (Section 11.9). 
There is also substantial evidence of changes in meteorological droughts at 1.5°C vs 2°C of global warming 
from global studies (Wartenburger et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2019a). The patterns of projected changes in mean 
precipitation are consistent with the changes in the drought duration, but they are not consistent with the 
changes in drought intensity (Ukkola et al., 2020). In general, CMIP6 projections suggest a stronger increase 
of the probability of precipitation deficits than CMIP5 projections (Cook et al., 2020; Ukkola et al., 2020). 
Projections for the number of CDDs in CMIP6 (Figure 11.19) for different levels of global warming relative 
to 1850-1900 show similar spatial patterns as projected precipitation deficits. The robustness of the patterns 
in projected precipitation deficits identified in the global studies is also consistent with results from regional 
studies (Giorgi et al., 2014; Marengo and Espinoza, 2016; Pinto et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2018a; Maúre et 
al., 2018; Nangombe et al., 2018; Tabari and Willems, 2018; Abiodun et al., 2019; Dosio et al., 2019).  
 
In Africa, a strong increase in the length of dry spells (CDD) is projected for 4°C of global warming over 
most of the continent with the exception of central and eastern Africa (Giorgi et al., 2014; Han et al., 2019; 
Sillmann et al., 2013; Section 11.9). In West Africa, a strong reduction of precipitation is projected 
(Sillmann et al., 2013a; Diallo et al., 2016; Akinsanola and Zhou, 2018; Han et al., 2019; Todzo et al., 2020) 
at 4°C of global warming, and CDD would increase with stronger global warming levels (Klutse et al., 
2018). The regions most strongly affected are Southern Africa (ESAF, WSAF; (Nangombe et al., 2018; 
Abiodun et al., 2019) and Northern Africa (part of MED region), with increases in meteorological droughts 
already at 1.5°C of global warming, and further increases with increasing global warming (Section 11.9). 
CDD is projected to increase more in the southern Mediterranean (northern Africa) than in the northern part 
of the Mediterranean region (Lionello and Scarascia, 2020). 
 
In Asia, most AR6 regions show low confidence in projected changes in meteorological droughts at 1.5°C 
and 2°C of global warming, with a few regions displaying a decrease in meteorological droughts at 4°C of 
global warming (RAR, ESB, RFE, ECA; medium confidence), although there is a projected increase in 
meteorological droughts in Southeast Asia (SEA) at 4°C (medium confidence) (Section 11.9). In Southeast 
Asia, an increasing frequency of precipitation deficits is projected as a consequence of an increasing 
frequency of extreme El Niño (Cai et al., 2014a, 2015, 2018).  
 
In central America, projections suggest an increase in mid-summer meteorological drought (Imbach et al., 
2018) and increased CDD (Nakaegawa et al., 2013; Chou et al., 2014a; Giorgi et al., 2014). In the Amazon, 
there is also a projected increase in dryness (Marengo and Espinoza, 2016), which is the combination of a 
projected increase in the frequency and geographic extent of meteorological drought in the eastern Amazon, 
and an opposite trend in the West (Duffy et al., 2015). In southwestern South America, there is a projected 
increase of the CDD (Chou et al., 2014a; Giorgi et al., 2014) and in Chile, drying is projected to prevail 
(Boisier et al., 2018). In the South America monsoon region, an increase in CDD is projected (Chou et al., 
2014a; Giorgi et al., 2014), but a decrease is projected in southeastern and southern South America (Giorgi et 
al., 2014). In Central America, mid summer meteorological drought is projected to intensify during 2071-
2095 for the RCP8.5 scenario (Corrales-Suastegui et al., 2019).  
 
An increase in the frequency, duration and intensity of meteorological droughts is projected in southwest, 
south and east Australia (Kirono et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020). In Canada and most of the USA, and based on 
the SPI, Swain and Hayhoe (2015) identified drier summer conditions in projections over most of the region, 
and there is a consistent signal toward an increase in duration and intensity of droughts in southern North 
America (Pascale et al., 2016; Escalante-Sandoval and Nuñez-Garcia, 2017). In California, more 
precipitation variability is projected, characterised by increased frequency of consecutive drought and humid 
periods (Swain et al., 2018).  
 
Substantial increases in meteorological drought are projected in Europe, in particular in the Mediterranean 
region already at 1.5°C of global warming (Section 11.9). In southern Europe, model projections display a 
consistent drying among models (Russo et al., 2013; Hertig and Tramblay, 2017; Guerreiro et al., 2018a; 
Raymond et al., 2019). In Western and Central Europe there is some spread in CMIP5 projections, with 
some models projecting very strong drying and others close to no trend (Vogel et al., 2018), although CDD 
is projected to increase in CMIP5 projections under the RCP 8.5 scenario (Hari et al., 2020). The overall 
evidence suggests an increase in meteorological drought at 4°C in the WCE region (medium confidence; 
Section 11.9).  
 
Overall, based on both global and regional studies, several hot spot regions are identified displaying more 
frequent and severe meteorological droughts with increasing with global warming, including several AR6 
regions at 1.5°C (WSAF, ESAF, SAU, MED, NES) and 2°C of global warming (WSAF, ESAF, EAU, SAU, 
MED, NCA, SCA, NSA, NES) (Section 11.9). At 4°C of global warming, there is also confidence in 
increases in meteorological droughts in further regions (WAF, WCE, ENA, CAR, NWS, SAM, SWS, SSA; 
Section 11.9), showing a geographical expansion of meteorological drought with increasing global warming. 
Only few regions are projected to have less intense or frequent meteorological droughts (Section 11.9). 
 
 
### 11.6.5.2  Atmospheric evaporative demand 
 
Effects of AED on droughts in future projections is under debate. CMIP5 models project an AED increase 
over the majority of the world with increasing global warming, mostly as a consequence of strong VPD 
increases (Scheff and Frierson, 2015; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2020b). However, ET is projected to increase 
less than AED in many regions, due to plant physiological responses related to i) CO2 effects on plant 
photosynthesis and ii) soil moisture control on ET.  
 
Several studies suggest that increasing atmospheric CO2 could lead to reduced leaf stomatal conductance, 
which would increase water-use efficiency and reduce plant water needs, thus limiting ET (Chapter 5, Cross-
Chapter Box 5.1; Greve et al., 2017; Lemordant et al., 2018; Milly and Dunne, 2016; Roderick et al., 2015; 
Scheff et al., 2017; Swann, 2018; Swann et al., 2016). The implemention of a CO2-dependent land resistance 
parameter has been suggested for the estimation of AED (Yang et al., 2019). Nevertheless, there are other 
relevant mechanisms, as soil moisture deficits and VPD also play an importantrole in the control of the leaf 
stomatal conductance (Xu et al., 2016b; Menezes-Silva et al., 2019; Grossiord et al., 2020) and a number of 
ecophysiological and anatomical processes affect the response of plant physiology under higheratmospheric 
CO2 concentrations (Mankin et al., 2019; Menezes-Silva et al., 2019; Chapter 5, Cross-Chapter Box 5.1). 
The benefits of the atmospheric CO2 for plant stress and agricultural and ecological droughts would be 
minimal precisely during dry periods given stomatal closure in response to limited soil moisture (Allen et al., 
2015; Xu et al., 2016b). In addition, CO2 effects on plant stomatal conductance could not entirely 
compensate the increased demand associated to warming (Liu and Sun, 2017); in large tropical and 
subtropical regions (e.g. southern Africa, the Amazon, the Mediterranean and southern North America), 
AED is projected to increase even considering the possible CO2 effects on the land resistance (Vicente-
Serrano et al., 2020b). Moreover, these CO2 effects would not affect the direct evaporation from soils and 
water bodies, which is very relevant in the reservoirs of warm areas (Friedrich et al., 2018). Because of these 
uncertainties, there is low confidence whether increased CO2-induced water-use efficiency in vegetation will 
substantially reduce global plant transpiration and will diminish the frequency and severity of soil moisture 
and streamflow deficits associated with the radiative effect of higher CO2 concentrations (Chapter 5, CC Box 
5.1). 
 
Another mechanism reducing the ET response to increased AED in projections is the control of soil moisture 
limitations on ET, which leads to reduced stomatal conductance under water stress (Berg and Sheffield, 
2018; Stocker et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2021). This response may be further amplified through VPD-induced 
decreases in stomatal conductance (Anderegg et al., 2020). However, the decreased stomatal conductance in 
response to both soil moisture limitation and enhanced CO2 would further enhance AED  (Sherwood and Fu, 
2014; Berg et al., 2016; Teuling, 2018; Miralles et al., 2019), whereby the overall effects on AED in ESMs 
are found to be of similar magnitude for soil moisture limitation and CO2 physiological effects on stomatal 
conductance (Berg et al., 2016). Increased AED is thus both a driver and a feedback with respect to changes 
in ET, complicating the interpretation of its role on drought changes with increasing CO2 concentrations and 
global warming.  
 
 
### 11.6.5.3  Soil moisture deficits 
 
Areas with projected soil moisture decreases do not fully coincide with areas with projected precipitation 
decreases, although there is substantial consistency in the respective patterns (Dirmeyer et al., 2013; Berg 
and Sheffield, 2018). There are, however, more regions affected by increased soil moisture deficits (Figure 
11.19) than precipitation deficits (CC-Box 11.1, Figures 2a,b,c), as a consequence of enhanced AED and the 
associated increased ET, as highlighted by some studies (Dai et al., 2018; Orlowsky and Seneviratne, 2013; 
Chapter 8, Section 8.2.2.1). Moisture in the top soil layer is projected to decrease more than precipitation at 
all warming levels (Lu et al., 2019), extending the regions affected by severe soil moisture deficits over most 
of south and central Europe (Lehner et al., 2017; Ruosteenoja et al., 2018; Samaniego et al., 2018; Van Der 
Linden et al., 2019), southern North America (Cook et al., 2019), South America (Orlowsky and 
Seneviratne, 2013), southern Africa (Lu et al., 2019), East Africa (Rowell et al., 2015), southern Australia 
(Kirono et al., 2020), India (Mishra et al., 2014b) and East Asia (Cheng et al., 2015) (Figure 11.19). 
Projected changes in total soil moisture display less widespread drying than those for surface soil moisture 
(Berg et al., 2017b), but still more than for precipitation (CC-Box 11.1, Figures 2a,b,c). The severity of 
droughts based on surface soil moisture in future projections is stronger than projections based on 
precipitation and runoff (Dai et al., 2018; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2020a). Nevertheless, in many parts of the 
world in which soil moisture is projected to decrease, the signal to noise ratio among models is low and only 
in the Mediterranean, Europe, the southwestern United States, and southern Africa the projections show a 
high signal to noise ratio in soil moisture projections (Lu et al., 2019; (Figure 11.19). Increases in soil 
moisture deficits are found to be statistically signicant at regional scale in the Mediterranean region, 
Southern Africa and Western South America for changes as small as 0.5°C in global warming, based on 
differences between +1.5°C and +2°C of global warming (Wartenburger et al., 2017). Several other regions 
are affected when considering changes in droughts for higher changes in global warming (Figure 11.19; 
Section 11.9). Seasonal projections of drought frequency for boreal winter (DJF) and summer (JJA), from 
CMIP6 multimodel ensemble for 1.5ºC, 2ºC and 4ºC global warming levels, show contrasting trends (Fig 
11.19). In the boreal winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the areas affected by drying show high agreement 
with those characterized by increase in meteorological drought projections (Chapter 8, Figure 8.14; Chapter 
12, Figure 12.4). On the contrary, in the boreal summer the drought frequency increases worldwide in 
comparison to meteorological drought projections, with large areas of the Northern Hemisphere displaying a 
high signal to noise ratio (low spead between models). This stresses the dominant influence of ET (as a result 
of increased AED) in intensifying agricultural and ecological droughts in the warm season in many locations, 
including mid- to high latitudes. 
 
Increased soil moisture limitation and associated changes in droughts are projected to lead to increased 
vegetation stress affecting the global land carbon sink in ESM projections (Green et al., 2019), with 
implications for projected global warming (Cross-Chapter Box 5). There is high confidence that the global 
land sink will become less efficient due to soil moisture limitations and associated agricultural and 
ecological drought conditions in some regions in higher emission scenarios specially under global warming 
levels above 4°C ; however, there is low confidence on how these water cycle feedbacks will play out in 
lower emission scenarios (at 2°C global warming or lower) (Cross-Chapter Box5.1). 
 
<figref>11.18</figref> 

 
### 11.6.5.4  Hydrological deficits 
 
Some studies support wetting tendencies as a response to a warmer climate when considering globally-
averaged changes in runoff over land (Roderick et al., 2015; Greve et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2018e), and 
streamflow projections respond to enhanced CO2 concentrations in CMIP5 models (Yang et al., 2019). 
Nevertheless, when focusing regionally on low-runoff periods, model projections also show an increase of 
hydrological droughts in large world regions (Wanders and Van Lanen, 2015; Dai et al., 2018; Vicente-
Serrano et al., 2020a). In general, the frequency of hydrological deficits is projected to increase over most of 
the continents, although with regionally and seasonally differentiated effects (Section 11.9), with medium 
confidence of increase in the following AR6 regions:WCE, MED, SAU, WCA, WNA, SCA, NSA, SAM, 
SWS, SSA, WSAF, ESAF and MDG (Section 11.9; Cook et al., 2019; Forzieri et al., 2014; Giuntoli et al., 
2015; Marx et al., 2018; Prudhomme et al., 2014; Roudier et al., 2016; Wanders and Van Lanen, 2015; Zhao 
et al., 2020). There are, however, large uncertainties related to the hydrological/impact model used 
(Prudhomme et al., 2014; Schewe et al., 2014; Gosling et al., 2017), limited signal-to-noise ratio (due to 
model spread) in several regions (Giuntoli et al., 2015), and also uncertainties in the projection of future 
human activities including water demand and land cover changes, which may represent more than 50% of 
the projected changes in hydrological droughts in some regions (Wanders and Wada, 2015).  
 
Regions dependent on mountainous snowpack as a temporary reservoir may be affected by severe 
hydrological droughts in a warmer world. In the southern European Alps, both winter and summer low flows 
are projected to be more severe, with a 25% decrease in the 2050s (Vidal et al., 2016). In the western United 
States, a 22% reduction in winter snow water equivalent is projected at around 2°C of global warming with a 
further decrease of a 70% reduction at 4°C global warming (Rhoades et al., 2018). This decline would cause 
less predictable hydrological droughts in snowmelt-dominated areas of North America (Livneh and Badger, 
2020). The exact magnitude of the influence of higher temperatures on snow-related droughts is, however, 
difficult to estimate (Mote et al., 2016), since the streamflow changes could affect the timing of peak 
streamflows but not necessarily their magnitude. In addition, projected changes in hydrological droughts 
downstream of declining glaciers can be very complex to assess (Chapter 9, see also SROCC). 
 
 
### 11.6.5.5  Atmospheric-based drought indices 
 
Studies show a stronger drying in projections based on atmospheric-based drought indices compared to ESM 
projections of changes in soil moisture (Berg and Sheffield, 2018) and runoff (Yang et al., 2019). It has been 
suggested that this difference is due to physiological CO2 effects (Greve et al., 2019; Lemordant et al., 2018; 
Milly and Dunne, 2016; Roderick et al., 2015; Scheff, 2018; Swann, 2018; Swann et al., 2016; Yang et al., 
2020; Section 11.6.5.2). Nonetheless, there is evidence that differences in projections between atmospheric-
based drought indices and water-balance metrics from ESMs are not alone due to CO2-plant effects (Berg et 
al., 2016; Scheff et al., 2021), and can be also related to the fact that AED is an upper bound for ET in dry 
regions and conditions (Section 11.6.1.2) and that soil moisture stress limits increases in ET in projections 
(Berg et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2021; Section 11.6.5.2). Atmospheric-based indices show in general more 
drying than total column soil moisture (Berg and Sheffield, 2018; Cook et al., 2020; Scheff et al., 2021), but 
are more consistent with projected increases in surface soil moisture deficits (Dirmeyer et al., 2013; Dai et 
al., 2018; Lu et al., 2019; Cook et al., 2020; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2020a).  
 
Atmospheric-based drought indices are not metrics of soil moisture or runoff (11.6.1.5) so their projections 
may not necessarily reflect the same trend of online simulated soil moisture and runoff. Independently of 
effects on the land water balance, atmospheric-based drought indices will reflect the potential vegetation 
stress resulting from deficits between available water and enhanced AED, even in conditions with no or only 
low ET. Under dry conditions, the enhanced AED associated to the human forcing would increase plant 
water stress (Brodribb et al., 2020), with effects on widespread forest dieback and mortality (Anderegg et al., 
2013; Williams et al., 2013; Allen et al., 2015; McDowell and Allen, 2015; McDowell et al., 2016, 2020), 
and stronger risk of megafires (Flannigan et al., 2016; Podschwit et al., 2018; Clarke and Evans, 2019; 
Varela et al., 2019). For these reasons, there is high confidence that the future projections of enhanced 
drought severity showed by the PDSI-PM and the SPEI-PM are representative of more frequent and severe 
plant stress episodes and more severe agricultural and ecological drought impacts in some regions.  
 
Global tendencies towards more severe and frequent agricultural and ecological drought conditions are 
identified in future projections when focusing on atmospheric-based drought indices such as the PDSI-PM or 
the SPEI-PM. They expand the spatial extent of drought conditions compared to meteorological drought to 
most of North America, Europe, Africa, Central and East Asia and southern Australia (Cook et al., 2014a; 
Chen and Sun, 2017b, 2017a; Zhao and Dai, 2017; Gao et al., 2017b; Lehner et al., 2017; Dai et al., 2018; 
Naumann et al., 2018; Potopová et al., 2018; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2020a; Gu et al., 2020; Dai, 2021). 
Projections in PDSI-PM and SPEI-PM are used in complement to changes in total soil moisture for the 
assessed projected changes in agricultural and ecological drought (Section 11.9). 


### 11.6.5.6  Synthesis for different drought types 
 
The tables in Section 11.9 provide assessed projected changes in metorological drought, agricultural and 
ecological drought, and hydrological droughts. The assessment shows that several regions will be affected by 
more severe agricultural and ecological droughts even if global warming is stabilized at well below 2°C, and 
1.5°C, within the bounds of the Paris Agreement (high confidence). The most affected regions include WCE, 
MED, EAU, SAU, SCA, NSA, SAM, SWS, SSA, NCA, CAN, WSAF, ESAF and MDG (medium 
confidence). At 4°C of global warming, even more regions would be affected by agricultural and ecological 
droughts (WCE, MED, CAU, EAU, SAU, WCA, EAS, SCA, CAR, NSA, NES, SAM, SWS, SSA, NCA, 
CAN, ENA, WNA, WSAF, ESAF and MDG). NEAF, SAS are also projected to experience less agricultural 
and ecological drought with global warming (medium confidence). Projected changes in meteorological 
droughts are overall less extended but also affect several AR6 regions, at 1.5°C and 2°C (MED, EAU, SAU, 
SCA, NSA, NCA, WSAF, ESAF, MDG) and 4ºC of global warming (WCE, MED, EAU, SAU, SEA, SCA, 
CAR, NWS, NSA, NES, SAM, SWS, SSA, NCA, ENA, WAF, WSAF, ESAF, MDG). Several regions are 
also projected to be affected by more hydrological droughts at 1.5°C and 2°C (WCE, MED, WNA, WSAF, 
ESAF) and 4ºC of global warming (NEU, WCE, EEU, MED, SAU, WCA, SCA, NSA, SAM, SWS, SSA, 
WNA, WSAF, ESAF, MDG). To illustrate the changes in both intensity and frequency of drought in the 
regions where strongest changes are projected, Figure 11.18 displays changes in the intensity and frequency 
of soil moisture drought under different global warming levels (1.5°C, 2°C, 4°C) relative to the 1851-1900 
baseline based on CMIP6 simulations under different SSP forcing scenarios. The 90% uncertainty ranges for 
the projected changes in both intensity and frequency are above zero, indicating significant increase in both 
intensity and frequency of drought in these regions as whole. 
 
In summary, the land area affected by increasing drought frequency and severity expands with increasing 
global warming (high confidence). New evidence strengthens the SR15 conclusion that even relatively small 
incremental increases in global warming (+0.5°C) cause a worsening of droughts in some regions (high 
confidence). Several regions will be affected by more frequent and severe agricultural and ecological 
droughts even if global warming is stabilized at 1.5-2°C (high confidence). The most affected regions 
include WCE, MED, EAU, SAU, SCA, NSA, SAM, SWS, SSA, NCA, CAN, WSAF, ESAF and MDG 
(medium confidence). At 4°C of global warming, even more regions would be affected by agricultural and 
ecological droughts (WCE, MED, CAU, EAU, SAU, WCA, EAS, SCA, CAR, NSA, NES, SAM, SWS, 
SSA, NCA, CAN, ENA, WNA, WSAF, ESAF and MDG). Some regions are also projected to experience 
less agricultural and ecological drought with global warming (medium confidence; (NEAF, SAS)). There is 
high confidence that the projected increases in agricultural and ecological droughts are strongly affected by 
AED increases in a warming climate, although ET increases are projected to be smaller than those in AED 
due to soil moisture limitations and CO2 effects on leaf stomatal conductance. Enhanced atmospheric CO2 
concentrations lead to enhanced water-use efficiency in plants (medium confidence), but there is low 
confidence that it can ameliorate agricultural and ecological droughts, or hydrological droughts, at higher 
global warming levels characterized by limited soil moisture and enhanced AED. 
 
Projected changes in meteorological droughts are overall less extended than for agricultural and ecological 
droughts, but also affect several AR6 regions, even at 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming. Several regions are 
also projected to be more strongly affected by hydrological droughts with increasing global warming (NEU, 
WCE, EEU, MED, SAU, WCA, SCA, NSA, SAM, SWS, SSA, WNA, WSAF, ESAF, MDG).  Increased 
soil moisture limitation and associated changes in droughts are projected to lead to increased vegetation 
stress in many regions, with implications for the global land carbon sink (CC-Box 5). There is high 
confidence that the global land sink will become less efficient due to soil moisture limitations and associated 
drought conditions in some regions in higher emission scenarios specially under global warming levels 
above 4°C ; however, there is low confidence on how these water cycle feedbacks will play out in lower 
emission scenarios (at 2°C global warming or lower) (Cross-Chapter Box5.1).

# <goto>11.7</goto>  Extreme storms 
 
Extreme storms, such as tropical cyclones (TCs), extratropical cyclones (ETCs), and severe convective 
storms often have substantial societal impacts. Quantifying the effect of climate change on extreme storms is 
challenging, partly because extreme storms are rare, short-lived, and local, and individual events are largely 
influenced by stochastic variability. The high degree of random variability makes detection and attribution of 
extreme storm trends more uncertain than detection and attribution of trends in other aspects of the 
environment in which the storms evolve (e.g., larger-scale temperature trends). Projecting changes in 
extreme storms is also challenging because of constraints in the models' ability to accurately represent the 
small-scale physical processes that can drive these changes. Despite the challenges, progress has been made 
since AR5. 
 
SREX (Chapter 3) concluded that there is low confidence in observed long-term (40 years or more) trends in 
TC intensity, frequency, and duration, and any observed trends in phenomena such as tornadoes and hail; it 
is likely that extratropical storm tracks have shifted poleward in both the Northern and Southern 
Hemispheres and that heavy rainfalls and mean maximum wind speeds associated with TCs will increase 
with continued greenhouse gas (GHG) warming; it is likely that the global frequency of TCs will either 
decrease or remain essentially unchanged, while it is more likely than not that the frequency of the most 
intense storms will increase substantially in some ocean basins; there is low confidence in projections of 
small-scale phenomena such as tornadoes and hail storms; and there is medium confidence that there will be 
a reduced frequency and a poleward shift of mid-latitude cyclones due to future anthropogenic climate 
change.  
 
Since SREX, several IPCC assessments also assessed storms. AR5 (Chapter 2, Hartmann et al., 2013) 
assessment with low confidence observed long-term trends in TC metrics, but revised the statement from 
SREX to state that it is virtually certain that there are increasing trends in North Atlantic TC activity since 
the 1970s, with medium confidence that anthropogenic aerosol forcing has contributed to these trends. AR5 
concluded that it is likely that TC precipitation and mean intensity will increase and more likely than not that 
the frequency of the strongest storms increases with continued GHG warming. Confidence in projected 
trends in overall TC frequency remained low. Confidence in observed and projected trends in hail storm and 
tornado events also remained low. SROCC (Chapter 6, Collins et al., 2019) assessed past and projected TCs 
and ETCs supporting the conclusions of AR5 with some additional detail. Literature subsequent to AR5 adds 
support to the likelihood of increasing trends in TC intensity, precipitation, and frequency of the most intense 
storms, while some newer studies have added uncertainty to projected trends in overall frequency. A 
growing body literature since AR5 on the poleward migration of TCs led to a new assessment in SROCC of 
low confidence that the migration in the western North Pacific represents a detectable climate change 
contribution from anthropogenic forcing. SR15 (Chapter 3, Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018) essentially 
confirmed the AR5 assessment of TCs and ETCs, adding that heavy precipitation associated with TCs is 
projected to be higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C global warming (medium confidence). 
SREX, AR5, SROCC, and SR15, do not provide assessments of the atmospheric rivers and SROCC and 
SR15 do not assess severe convective storms and extreme winds. This section assesses the state of 
knowledge on the four phenomena of TCs, ETCs, severe convective storms, and extreme winds. 
Atmospheric rivers are addressed in Chapter 8. In this respect, this assessment closely mirrors the SROCC 
assessment of TCs and ETCs, while updating SREX and AR5 assessments of severe convective storms and 
extreme winds. 
 
 
## 11.7.1  Tropical cyclones 
 
### 11.7.1.1  Mechanisms and drivers 
 
The genesis, development, and tracks of TCs depend on conditions of the larger-scale circulations of the 
atmosphere and ocean (Christensen et al., 2013). Large-scale atmospheric circulations (Annex VI), such as 
the Hadley and Walker circulations and the monsoon circulations, and internal variability acting on various 
time-scales, from intra-seasonal (e.g., the Madden-Julian and Boreal Summer Intraseasonal oscillations  
(MJO, BSISO), and equatorial waves) and inter-annual (e.g., the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and 
Pacific and Atlantic Meridional Modes (PMM, AMM)), to inter-decadal (e.g., Atlantic Multidecadal 
Variability and Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV)) can all significantly affect TCs. This broad range of 
natural variability makes detection of anthropogenic effects difficult, and uncertainties in the projected 
changes of these modes of variability increase uncertainty in the projected changes in TC activity. Aerosol 
forcing also affects SST patterns and cloud microphysics, and it is likely that observed changes in TC activity 
are partly caused by changes in aerosol forcing (Evan et al., 2011; Ting et al., 2015; Sobel et al., 2016, 2019; 
Takahashi et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2018; Reed et al., 2019). Among possible changes from these drivers, 
there is medium confidence that the Hadley cell has widened and will continue to widen in the future 
(Chapter 2.3, 3.3, 4.5). This likely causes latitudinal shifts of TC tracks (Sharmila and Walsh, 2018). 
Regional TC activity changes are also strongly affected by projected changes in SST warming patterns 
(Yoshida et al., 2017), which are highly uncertain (Chapter 4, 9). 
 
 
### 11.7.1.2  Observed trends 
 
Identifying past trends in TC metrics remains a challenge due to the heterogeneous character of the historical 
instrumental data, which are known as “best-track” data (Schreck et al., 2014). There is low confidence in 
most reported long-term (multidecadal to centennial) trends in TC frequency- or intensity-based metrics due 
to changes in the technology used to collect the best-track data. This should not be interpreted as implying 
that no physical (real) trends exist, but rather as indicating that either the quality or the temporal length of the 
data is not adequate to provide robust trend detection statements, particularly in the presence of multidecadal 
variability.  
 
There are previous and ongoing efforts to homogenize the best-track data (Elsner et al., 2008; Kossin et al., 
2013, 2020; Choy et al., 2015; Landsea, 2015; Emanuel et al., 2018) and there is substantial literature that 
finds positive trends in intensity-related metrics in the best-track during the “satellite period”, which is 
generally limited to the past ~40 years (Kang and Elsner, 2012; Kishtawal et al., 2012; Kossin et al., 2013, 
2020; Mei and Xie, 2016; Zhao et al., 2018; Tauvale and Tsuboki, 2019). When best-track trends are tested 
using homogenized data, the intensity trends generally remain positive, but are smaller in amplitude (Kossin 
et al., 2013; Holland and Bruyère, 2014). Kossin et al. (2020) extended the homogenized TC intensity record 
to the period 1979–2017 and identified significant global increases in major TC exceedance probability of 
about 6% per decade. In addition to trends in TC intensity, there is evidence that TC intensification rates and 
the frequency of rapid intensification events have increased within the satellite era (Kishtawal et al. 2012; 
Balaguru et al., 2018; Bhatia et al., 2018). The increase in intensification rates is found in the best-track as 
well as the homogenized intensity data. 
 
A subset of the best-track data corresponding to hurricanes that have directly impacted the United States 
since 1900 is considered to be reliable, and shows no trend in the frequency of U.S. landfall events (Knutson 
et al., 2019). However, in this period since 1900, an increasing trend in normalized U.S. hurricane damage, 
which accounts for temporal changes in exposed wealth (Grinsted et al., 2019), and a decreasing trend in TC 
translation speed over the U.S. (Kossin, 2019) have been identified. A similarly reliable subset of the data 
representing TC landfall frequency over Australia shows a decreasing trend in eastern Australia since the 
1800s (Callaghan and Power, 2011), as well as in other parts of Australia since 1982 (Chand et al., 2019; 
Knutson et al., 2019), and a paleoclimate proxy reconstruction shows that recent levels of TC interactions 
along parts of the Australian coastline are the lowest in the past 550–1,500 years (Haig et al., 2014). Existing 
TC datasets show substantial interdecadal variations in basin-wide TC frequency and intensity in the western 
North Pacific, but a statistically significant northwestward shift in the western North Pacific TC tracks since 
the 1980s (Lee et al., 2020b). In the case of the North Indian Ocean, analyses of trends are highly dependent 
on the details of each analysis (e.g., pre- and/or post-monsoon season period, or Bay of Bengal and/or 
Arabian Sea region). The most consistent trends are an increase in the occurrence of the most intense TCs 
and a decrease in the overall TC frequency, in particular in the Bay of Bengal (Sahoo and Bhaskaran, 2016; 
Balaji et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2019; Baburaj et al., 2020). In the South Indian Ocean (SIO), an increase in 
the occurrence of the most intense TCs has been noted, however there are well-known data quality issues 
there (Kuleshov et al., 2010; Fitchett, 2018). When the SIO data are homogenized, a significant increase is 
found in the fractional proportion of global category 3-5 TC estimates to all category 1-5 estimates (Kossin 
et al., 2020).   
 
As with all confined regional analyses of TC frequency, it is generally unclear whether any identified 
changes are due to a basin-wide change in TC frequency, or to systematic track shifts (or both). From an 
impacts perspective, however, these changes over land are highly relevant and emphasize that large-scale 
modifications in TC behaviour can have a broad spectrum of impacts on a regional scale. 
 
Subsequent to AR5, two metrics that are argued to be comparatively less sensitive to data issues than 
frequency- and intensity-based metrics have been analysed. Trends in these metrics have been identified over 
the past ~70 years or more (Knutson et al., 2019). The first metric, the mean latitude where TCs reach their 
peak intensity, exhibits a global and regional poleward migration during the satellite period (Kossin et al., 
2014). The poleward migration can influence TC hazard exposure and risk (Kossin et al., 2016a) and is 
consistent with the independently-observed expansion of the tropics (Lucas et al., 2014). The migration has 
been linked to changes in the Hadley circulation (Altman et al., 2018; Sharmila and Walsh, 2018; Studholme 
and Gulev, 2018). The migration is also apparent in the mean locations where TCs exhibit eyes (Knapp et al., 
2018), which is when TCs are most intense. Part of the Northern Hemisphere poleward migration is due to 
inter-basin changes in TC frequency (Kossin et al., 2014, 2016b, Moon et al., 2015, 2016) and the trends, as 
expected, can be sensitive to the time period chosen (Tennille and Ellis, 2017; Kossin, 2018; Song and 
Klotzbach, 2018) and to subsetting of the data by intensity (Zhan and Wang, 2017). The poleward migration 
is particularly pronounced and well-documented in the western North Pacific basin (Kossin et al., 2016a; 
Oey and Chou, 2016; Liang et al., 2017; Nakamura et al., 2017; Altman et al., 2018; Daloz and Camargo, 
2018; Sun et al., 2019b; Lee et al., 2020b; Yamaguchi and Maeda, 2020a; Kubota et al., 2021).  
 
<figref>11.20</figref> 
 
A second metric that is argued to be comparatively less sensitive to data issues than frequency- and intensity-
based metrics is TC translation speed (Kossin, 2018), which exhibits a global slowdown in the best-track 
data over the period 1949-2016. TC translation speed is a measure of the speed at which TCs move across 
the Earth’s surface and is very closely related to local rainfall amounts (i.e., a slower translation speed causes 
greater local rainfall). TC translation speed also affects structural wind damage and coastal storm surge by 
changing the hazard event duration. The slowdown is observed in the best-track data from all basins except 
the Northern Indian Ocean and is also found in a number of regions where TCs interact directly with land. 
The slowing trends identified in the best-track data by Kossin (2018) have been argued to be largely due to 
data heterogeneity. Moon et al. (2019) and Lanzante (2019) provide evidence that meridional TC track shifts 
project onto the slowing trends and argue that these shifts are due to the introduction of satellite data. Kossin 
(2019) provides evidence that the slowing trend is real by focusing on Atlantic TC track data over the 
contiguous United States in the 118-year period 1900–2017, which are generally considered reliable. In this 
period, mean TC translation speed has decreased by 17%. The slowing TC translation speed is expected to 
increase local rainfall amounts, which would increase coastal and inland flooding. In combination with 
slowing translation speed, abrupt TC track direction changes – that can be associated with track “meanders” 
or “stalls” – have become increasingly common along the North American coast since the mid-20th century, 
leading to more rainfall in the region (Hall and Kossin, 2019).  
 
In summary, there is mounting evidence that a variety of TC characteristics have changed over various time 
periods. It is likely that the proportion of major TC intensities and the frequency of rapid intensification 
events have both increased globally over the past 40 years. It is very likely that the average location where 
TCs reach their peak wind-intensity has migrated poleward in the western North Pacific Ocean since the 
1940s. It is likely that TC translation speed has slowed over the U.S. since 1900.  
 
 
### 11.7.1.3  Model evaluation 
 
Accurate projections of future TC activity have two principal requirements: accurate representation of 
changes in the relevant environmental factors (e.g., SSTs) that can affect TC activity, and accurate 
representation of actual TC activity in given environmental conditions. In particular, models’ capacity to 
reproduce historical trends or interannual variabilities of TC activity is relevant to the confidence in future 
projections. One test of the models is to evaluate their ability to reproduce the dependency of the TC 
statistics in the different basins in the real world, in addition to their capability of reproducing atmospheric 
and ocean environmental conditions. For the evaluation of projections of TC-relevant environmental 
variables, AR5 confidence statements were based on global surface temperature and moisture, but not on the 
detailed regional structure of SST and atmospheric circulation changes such as steering flows and vertical 
shear, which affect characteristics of TCs (genesis, intensity, tracks, etc.). Various aspects of TC metrics are 
used to evaluate how capable models are of simulating present-day TC climatologies and variability (e.g. TC 
frequency, wind-intensity, precipitation, size, tracks, and their seasonal and interannual changes) (Camargo 
and Wing, 2016; Knutson et al., 2019, 2020; Walsh et al., 2015). Other examples of TC 
climatology/variability metrics are spatial distributions of TC occurrence and genesis (Walsh et al., 2015), 
seasonal cycles and interannual variability of basin-wide activity (Zhao et al., 2009; Shaevitz et al., 2014; 
Kodama et al., 2015; Murakami et al., 2015; Yamada et al., 2017) or landfalling activity (Lok and Chan, 
2018), as well as newly developed process-diagnostics designed specifically for TCs in climate models (Kim 
et al., 2018a; Wing et al., 2019; Moon et al., 2020).  
 
Confidence in the projection of intense TCs, such as those of Category 4-5, generally becomes higher as the 
resolution of the models becomes higher. CMIP5/6 class climate models (~100-200 km grid spacing) cannot 
simulate TCs of Category 4-5 intensity. They do simulate storms of relatively high vorticity that are at best 
described as “TC-like”, but metrics like storm counts are highly dependent on tracking algorithms (Wehner 
et al., 2015; Zarzycki and Ullrich, 2017; Roberts et al., 2020a). High-resolution global climate models (~10-
60 km grid spacing) as used in HighResMIP (Haarsma et al., 2016; Roberts et al., 2020a) begin to capture 
some structures of TCs more realistically, as well as produce intense TCs of Category 4-5 despite the effects 
of parameterized deep cumulus convection processes (Murakami et al., 2015; Wehner et al., 2015; Yamada 
et al., 2017; Roberts et al., 2018; Moon et al., 2020). Convection-permitting models (~1-10 km grid-
spacing), such as used in some dynamical downscaling studies, provide further realism with capturing eye 
wall structures (Tsuboki et al., 2015). Model characteristics besides resolution, especially details of 
convective parameterization, can influence a model’s ability to simulate intense TCs (Reed and Jablonowski, 
2011; Zhao et al., 2012; He and Posselt, 2015; Kim et al., 2018a; Zhang and Wang, 2018; Camargo et al., 
2020). However, models’ dynamical cores and other physics also affect simulated TC properties (Reed et al., 
2015; Vidale et al., 2021). Both wide-area regional and global convection-permitting models without the 
need for parameterized convection are becoming more useful for TC regional model projection studies  
(Tsuboki et al., 2015; Kanada et al., 2017a; Gutmann et al., 2018) and global model projection studies (Satoh 
et al., 2015, 2017; Yamada et al., 2017), as they capture more realistic eye-wall structures of TCs (Kinter et 
al., 2013) and are becoming more useful for investigating changes in TC structures (Kanada et al., 2013; 
Yamada et al., 2017). Large ensemble simulations of global climate models with 60 km grid spacing provide 
TC statistics that allow more reliable detection of changes in the projections, which are not well captured in 
any single experiment (Yoshida et al., 2017; Yamaguchi et al., 2020). Variable resolution global models 
offer an alternative to regional models for individual TC or basin-wide simulations (Yanase et al., 2012; 
Zarzycki et al., 2014; Harris et al., 2016; Reed et al., 2020; Stansfield et al., 2020). Computationally less 
intense than equivalent uniform resolution global models, they also do not require lateral boundary 
conditions, thus reducing this source of error (Hashimoto et al., 2016). Confidence in the projection of TC 
statistics and properties is increased by the higher-resolution models with more realistic simulations. 
 
Operational forecasting models also reproduce TCs and their use for climate projection studies shows 
promise. However, there is limited application for future projections as they are specifically developed for 
operational purposes and TC climatology is not necessarily well evaluated. Intercomparison of operational 
models indicates that enhancement of horizontal resolution can provide more credible projections of TCs 
(Nakano et al., 2017). Likewise, high-resolution climate models show promise as TC forecast tools (Zarzycki 
and Jablonowski, 2015; Reed et al., 2020), further narrowing the continuum of weather and climate models 
and increasing confidence in projections of future TC behaviour. However, higher horizontal resolution does 
not necessarily lead to an improved TC climatology (Camargo et al., 2020).  
 
Atmosphere-ocean interaction is an important process in TC evolution. Atmosphere-ocean coupled models 
are generally better than atmosphere-only models at capturing realistic processes related to TCs (Murakami 
et al., 2015; Ogata et al., 2015, 2016; Zarzycki, 2016; Kanada et al., 2017b; Scoccimarro et al., 2017), 
although the basin-scale SST biases commonly found in atmosphere-ocean models can introduce substantial 
errors in the simulated TC number (Hsu et al., 2019). Higher-resolution ocean models improve the 
simulation of TCs by reducing the SST climatology bias (Li and Sriver, 2018; Roberts et al., 2020a). Coarse 
resolution atmospheric models may degrade coupled model performance as well. For example, in a case 
study of Hurricane Harvey, Trenberth et al. (2018) suggested that the lack of realistic hurricane activity 
within coupled climate models hampers the models’ ability to simulate SST and ocean heat content and their 
changes.  
 
Even with higher-resolution atmosphere-ocean coupled models, TC projection studies still rely on 
assumptions in experimental design that introduce uncertainties. Computational constraints often limit the 
number of simulations, resulting in relatively small ensemble sizes and incomplete analyses of possible 
future SST magnitude and pattern changes (Zhao and Held, 2011; Knutson et al., 2013a). Uncertainties in 
aerosol forcing also are reflected in TC projection uncertainty (Wang et al., 2014). 
 
Regional climate models (RCM) with grid spacing around 15-50 km can be used to study the projection of 
TCs. RCMs are run with lateral and surface boundary conditions, which are specified by the atmospheric 
state and SSTs simulated by GCMs. Various combinations of the lateral and surface boundary conditions can 
be chosen for RCM studies, and uncertainties in the projection can be further examined in general. They are 
used for studying changes in TC characteristics in a specific area, such as Vietnam (Redmond et al., 2015) 
and the Philippines (Gallo et al., 2019). 
 
Less computationally-expensive downscaling approaches that allow larger ensembles and long-term studies 
are also used in the projection of TCs (Emanuel et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2018a). A statistical–dynamical TC 
downscaling method requires assumptions of the rate of seeding of random initial disturbances, which are 
generally assumed to not change with climate change (Emanuel et al., 2008; Emanuel, 2013). The results 
with the downscaling approach might depend on the assumptions which are required for the simplification of 
the methods.  
 
In summary, various types of models are useful to study climate changes of TCs, and there is no unique 
solution for choosing a model type. However, higher-resolution models generally capture TC properties 
more realistically (high confidence). In particular, models with horizontal resolutions of 10-60 km are 
capable of reproducing strong TCs with Category 4-5 and those of 1-10km are capable of the eyewall 
structure of TCs. Uncertainties in TC simulations come from details of the model configuration of both 
dynamical and physical processes. Models with realistic atmosphere-ocean interactions are generally better 
than atmosphere-only models at reproducing realistic TC evolutions (high confidence).

There is general agreement in the literature that anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols have 
measurably affected observed oceanic and atmospheric variability in TC-prone regions (see Chapter 3). This 
underpinned the SROCC assessment of medium confidence that humans have contributed to the observed 
increase in Atlantic hurricane activity since the 1970s (Chapter 5, Bindoff et al., 2013). Literature subsequent 
to the AR5 lends further support to this statement (Knutson et al., 2019). However, there is still no consensus 
on the relative magnitude of human and natural influences on past changes in Atlantic hurricane activity, and 
particularly on which factor has dominated the observed increase (Ting et al., 2015) and it remains uncertain 
whether past changes in Atlantic TC activity are outside the range of natural variability. A recent result using 
high-resolution dynamical model experiments suggested that the observed spatial contrast in TC trends 
cannot be explained only by multi-decadal natural variability, and that external forcing plays an important 
role (Murakami et al., 2020). Observational evidence for significant global increases in the proportion of 
major TC intensities (Kossin et al., 2020) is consistent with both theory and numerical modeling simulations, 
which generally indicate an increase in mean TC peak intensity and the proportion of very intense TCs in a 
warming world (Knutson et al., 2015, 2020, Walsh et al., 2015, 2016). In addition, high-resolution coupled 
model simulations provide support that natural variability alone is unlikely to explain the magnitude of the 
observed increase in TC intensification rates and upward TC intensity trend in the Atlantic basin since the 
early 1980s (Bhatia et al., 2019; Murakami et al. 2020). 
 
The cause of the observed slowdown in TC translation speed is not yet clear. Yamaguchi et al. (2020) used 
large ensemble simulations to argue that part of the slowdown is due to actual latitudinal shifts of TC tracks, 
rather than data artefacts, in addition to atmospheric circulation changes, while Zhang et al. (2020a) used 
large ensemble simulations to show that anthropogenic forcing can lead to a robust slowdown, particularly 
outside of the tropics at higher latitudes. Yamaguchi and Maeda (2020b) found a significant slowdown in the 
western North Pacific over the past 40 years and attributed the slowdown to a combination of natural 
variability and global warming. The slowing trend since 1900 over the U.S. is robust and significant after 
removing multidecadal variability from the time series (Kossin, 2019). Among the hypotheses discussed is 
the physical linkage between warming and slowing circulation (Held and Soden 2006, see also Section 
8.2.2.2), with expectations of Arctic amplification and weakening circulation patterns through weakening 
meridional temperature gradients (Coumou et al., 2018; see also Cross-Chapter Box 10.1), or through 
changes in planetary wave dynamics (Mann et al., 2017). The tropics expansion and the poleward shift of the 
mid-latitude westerlies associated with warming is also suggested for the reason of the slowdown (Zhang et 
al., 2020a). However, the connection of these mechanisms to the slowdown has not been robustly shown yet. 
Furthermore, slowing trends have not been unambiguously observed in circulation patterns that steer TCs 
such as the Walker and Hadley circulations (Section 2.3.1.4), although these circulations generally slow 
down in numerical simulations under global warming (Sections 4.5.1.6 and 8.4.2.2).  
 
The observed poleward trend in western North Pacific TCs remains significant after accounting for the 
known modes of dominant interannual to decadal variability in the region (Kossin et al., 2016a), and is also 
found in CMIP5 model-simulated TCs (in the recent historical period 1980–2005), although it is weaker than 
observed and is not statistically significant (Kossin et al., 2016a). However, the trend is significant in 21st 
century CMIP5 projections under the RCP8.5 scenario, with a similar spatial pattern and magnitude to the 
past observed changes in that basin over the period 1945–2016, supporting a possible anthropogenic GHG 
contribution to the observed trends (Knutson et al., 2019; Kossin et al., 2016a).  
 
The recent active TC seasons in some basins have been studied to determine whether there is anthropogenic 
influence. For 2015, Murakami et al. (2017) explored the unusually high TC frequency near Hawaii and in 
the eastern Pacific basin. Zhang et al. (2016) considered unusually high Accumulated Cyclone Energy 
(ACE) in the western North Pacific. Yang et al. (2018) and Yamada et al. (2019) looked at TC intensification 
in the western North Pacific. These studies suggest that the anomalous TC activity in 2015 was not solely 
explained by the effect of an extreme El Niño (see BOX 11.3), that there was also an anthropogenic 
contribution, mainly through the effects of SSTs in subtropical regions. In the post-monsoon seasons of 2014 
and 2015, tropical storms with lifetime maximum winds greater than 46 m s−1 were first observed over the 
Arabian Sea, and Murakami et al. (2017b) showed that the probability of late-season severe tropical storms is 
increased by anthropogenic forcing compared to the preindustrial era. Murakami et al. (2018) concluded that 
the active 2017 Atlantic hurricane season was mainly caused by pronounced SSTs in the tropical North 
Atlantic and that these types of seasonal events will intensify with projected anthropogenic forcing. The 
trans-basin SST change, which might be driven by anthropogenic aerosol forcing, also affects TC activity. 
Takahashi et al. (2017) suggested that a decrease in sulfate aerosol emissions caused about half of the 
observed decreasing trends in TC genesis frequency in the south-eastern region of the western North Pacific 
during 1992–2011. 
 
Event attribution is used in case studies of TCs to test whether the severities of recent intense TCs are 
explained without anthropogenic effects. In a case study of Hurricane Sandy (2012), Lackmann (2015) found 
no statistically significant impact of anthropogenic climate change on storm intensity, while projections in a 
warmer world showed significant strengthening. On the other hand, Magnusson et al. (2014) found that in 
ECMWF simulations, the simulated cyclone depth and intensity, as well as precipitation, were larger when 
the model was driven by the warmer actual SSTs than the climatological average SSTs. In super typhoon 
Haiyan, which struck the Philippines on 8 November 2013, Takayabu et al. (2015) took an event attribution 
approach with cloud system-resolving (~1km) downscaling ensemble experiments to evaluate the 
anthropogenic effect on typhoons, and showed that the intensity of the simulated worst case storm in the 
actual conditions was stronger than that in a hypothetical condition without historical anthropogenic forcing 
in the model. However, in a similar approach with two coarser parameterized convection models, Wehner et 
al. (2018) found conflicting human influences on Haiyan’s intensity. Patricola and Wehner (2018) found 
little evidence of an attributable change in intensity of hurricanes Katrina (2005), Irma (2017), and Maria 
(2017) using a regional climate model configured between 3 and 4.5 km resolution. They did, however, find 
attributable increases in heavy precipitation totals. These results imply that higher resolution, such as in a 
convective permitting 5-km or less mesh model, is required to obtain a robust anthropogenic intensification 
of a strong TC by simulating realistic rapid intensification of a TC (Kanada and Wada, 2016; Kanada et al., 
2017a), and that whether the intensification of TCs can be attributed to the recent warming depends on the 
case. 
 
The dominant factor in the extreme rainfall amounts during Hurricane Harvey’s passage onto the U.S. in 
2017 was its slow translation speed. But studies published after the event have argued that anthropogenic 
climate change contributed to an increase in rain rate, which compounded the extreme local rainfall caused 
by the slow translation. Emanuel (2017) used a large set of synthetically-generated storms and concluded 
that the occurrence of extreme rainfall as observed in Harvey was substantially enhanced by anthropogenic 
changes to the larger-scale ocean and atmosphere characteristics. Trenberth et al. (2018) linked Harvey’s 
rainfall totals to the anomalously large ocean heat content from the Gulf of Mexico. van Oldenborgh et al. 
(2017) and Risser and Wehner (2017) applied extreme value analysis to extreme rainfall records in the 
Houston, Texas region and both attributed large increases to climate change. Large precipitation increases 
during Harvey due to global warming were also found using climate models (van Oldenborgh et al., 2017; 
Wang et al., 2018b). Harvey precipitation totals were estimated in these papers to be 3 to 10 times more 
probable due to climate change. A best estimate from a regional climate and flood model is that urbanization 
increased the risk of the Harvey flooding by a factor of 21 (Zhang et al., 2018c). Anthropogenic effects on 
precipitation increases were also predicted in advance from a forecast model for Hurricane Florence in 2018 
(Reed et al., 2020).  
 
In summary, it is very likely that the recent active TC seasons in the North Atlantic, the North Pacific, and 
Arabian basins cannot be explained without an anthropogenic influence. The anthropogenic influence on 
these changes is principally associated to aerosol forcing, with stronger contributions to the response in the 
North Atlantic. It is more likely than not that the slowdown of TC translation speed over the USA has 
contributions from anthropogenic forcing. It is likely that the poleward migration of TCs in the western 
North Pacific and the global increase in TC intensity rates cannot be explained entirely by natural variability. 
Event attribution studies of specific strong TCs provide limited evidence for anthropogenic effects on TC 
intensifications so far, but high confidence for increases in TC heavy precipitation. There is high confidence 
that anthropogenic climate change contributed to extreme rainfall amounts during Hurricane Harvey (2017) 
and other intense TCs. 
 
### 11.7.1.5 Projections 
 
A summary of studies on TC projections for the late 21st century, particularly studies since AR5, is given by 
Knutson et al. (2020), which is an assessment report mandated by the World Meteorological Organization 
(WMO). Studies subsequent to Knutson et al. (2020) are generally consistent and the confidence assessments 
here closely follow theirs (Cha et al., 2020), although there are some differences due to the different 
confidence calibrations between the IPCC and WMO reports.  
 
There is not an established theory for the drivers of future changes in the frequency of TCs. Most, but not all, 
high-resolution global simulations project significant reductions in the total number of TCs, with the bulk of 
the reduction at the weaker end of the intensity spectrum as the climate warms (Knutson et al., 2020). Recent 
exceptions based on high-resolution coupled model results are noted in Bhatia et al. (2018) and Vecchi et al. 
(2019). Vecchi et al. (2019) showed that the representation of synoptic-scale seeds for TC genesis in their 
high-resolution model causes different projections of global TC frequency, and there is evidence for a 
decrease in seeds in some projected TC simulations (Sugi et al., 2020). However, other research indicates 
that TC seeds are not an independent control on climatological TC frequency, rather the seeds covary with 
the large-scale controls on TCs (Patricola et al., 2018). While empirical genesis indices derived from 
observations and reanalysis describe well the observed subseasonal and interannual variability of current TC 
frequency (Camargo et al., 2007, 2009; Tippett et al., 2011; Menkes et al., 2012), they fail to predict the 
decreased TC frequency found in most high-resolution model simulations (Zhang et al., 2010; Camargo, 
2013; Wehner et al., 2015), as they generally project an increase as the climate warms. This suggests a 
limitation of the use of the empirical genesis indices for projections of TC genesis, in particular due to their 
sensitivity to the humidity variable considered in the genesis index for these projections (Camargo et al., 
2014). In a different approach, a statistical-dynamical downscaling framework assuming a constant seeding 
rate with warming (Emanuel, 2013, 2021) exhibits increases in TC frequency consistent with genesis indices 
based projections, while downscaling with a different model leads to two different scenarios depending on 
the humidity variable considered (Lee et al., 2020a). This disparity in the sign of the projected change in 
global TC frequency and the difficulty in explaining the mechanisms behind the different signed responses 
further emphasizes the lack of process understanding of future changes in tropical cyclogenesis (Walsh et al., 
2015; Hoogewind et al., 2020). Even within a single model, uncertainty in the pattern of future SST changes 
leads to large uncertainties (including the sign) in the projected change in TC frequency in individual ocean 
basins, although global TCs would appear to be less sensitive (Yoshida et al., 2017; Bacmeister et al., 2018). 
 
Changes in SST and atmospheric temperature and moisture play a role in tropical cyclogenesis (Walsh et al., 
2015). Reductions in vertical convective mass flux due to increased tropical stability have been associated 
with a reduction in cyclogenesis (Held and Zhao, 2011; Sugi et al., 2012). Satoh et al. (2015) further posits 
that the robust simulated increase in the number of intense TCs, and hence increased vertical mass flux 
associated with intense TCs, must lead to a decrease in overall TC frequency because of this association. The 
Genesis Potential Index can be modified to mimic the TC frequency decreases of a model by altering the 
treatment of humidity (Camargo et al., 2014), supporting the idea that increased mid-tropospheric saturation 
deficit (Emanuel et al., 2008) controls TC frequency, but the approach remains empirical. Other possible 
controlling factors, such as a decline in the number of seeds (held constant in Emanuel’s downscaling 
approach, or dependent on the genesis index formulation in the approach proposed by Lee et al., 2020) 
caused by increased atmospheric stability have been proposed, but questioned as an important factor 
(Patricola et al., 2018). The resolution of atmospheric models affects the number of seeds, hence TC genesis 
frequency (Vecchi et al., 2019; Sugi et al., 2020; Yamada et al., 2021). The diverse and sometimes 
inconsistent projected changes in global TC frequency by high-resolution models indicate that better process 
understanding and improvement of the models are needed to raise confidence in these changes.  
 
Most TC-permitting model simulations (10-60 km or finer grid spacing) are consistent in their projection of 
increases in the proportion of intense TCs (Category 4-5), as well as an increase in the intensity of the 
strongest TCs defined by maximum wind speed or central pressure fall (Murakami et al., 2012; Tsuboki et 
al., 2015; Wehner et al., 2018a; Knutson et al., 2020). The general reduction in the total number of TCs, 
which is concentrated in storms weaker than or equal to Category 1, contributes to this increase. The models 
are somewhat less consistent in projecting an increase in the frequency of Category 4-5 TCs (Wehner et al., 
2018a). The projected increase in the intensity of the strongest TCs is consistent with theoretical 
understanding (e.g., Emanuel, 1987) and observations (e.g., Kossin et al., 2020). For a 2°C global warming, 
the median proportion of Category 4–5 TCs increases by 13%, while the median global TC frequency 
decreases by 14%, which implies that the median of the global Category 4–5 TC frequency is slightly 
reduced by 1% or almost unchanged (Knutson et al., 2020). Murakami et al. (2020) projected a decrease in 
TC frequency over the coming century in the North Atlantic due to greenhouse warming, as consistent with 
Dunstone et al. (2013), and a reduction in TC frequency almost everywhere in the tropics in response to +1% 
CO2 forcing; exceptions include the central North Pacific (Hawaii region), east of the Philippines in the 
North Pacific, and two relatively small regions in the northern Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. These 
projections can vary substantially between ocean basins, possibly due to differences in regional SST 
warming and warming patterns (Sugi et al., 2017; Yoshida et al., 2017; Bacmeister et al., 2018). A summary 
of projections of TC characteristics is schematically shown by Figure 11.20. 
 
The increase in global TC maximum surface wind speeds is about 5% for a 2°C global warming across a 
number of high-resolution multi-decadal studies (Knutson et al., 2020). This indicates the deepening in 
global TC minimum surface pressure under the global warming conditions. A regional cloud-permitting 
model study shows that the strongest TC in the western North Pacific can be as strong as 857 hPa in 
minimum surface pressure with a wind speed of 88 m s-1 under warming conditions in 2074-2087 (Tsuboki 
et al., 2015). TCs are also measured by quantities such as Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) and the 
power dissipation index (PDI), which conflate TC intensity, frequency, and duration (Murakami et al., 2014). 
Several TC modeling studies (Yamada et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2014a; Knutson et al., 2015) project little 
change or decreases in the globally-accumulated value of PDI or ACE, which is due to the decrease in the 
total number of TCs.  
 
A projected increase in global average TC rainfall rates of about 12% for a 2°C global warming is consistent 
with the Clausius-Clapeyron scaling of saturation specific humidity (Knutson et al., 2020). Increases 
substantially greater than Clausius-Clapeyron scaling are projected in some regions, which is caused by 
increased low-level moisture convergence due to projected TC intensity increases in those regions (Knutson 
et al., 2015; Phibbs and Toumi, 2016; Patricola and Wehner, 2018; Liu et al., 2019c). Projections of TC 
precipitation using large-ensemble experiments (Kitoh and Endo, 2019) show that the annual maximum 1-
day precipitation total is projected to increase, except for the western North Pacific where there is only a 
small change or even a reduction is projected, mainly due to a projected decrease of TC frequency. They also 
show that the 10-year return value of extreme Rx1day associated with TCs will greatly increase in a region 
extending from Hawaii to the south of Japan. TC tracks and the location of topography relative to TCs 
significantly affect precipitation, thus in general, areas on the eastern and southern faces of mountains have 
more impacts of TC precipitation changes (Hatsuzuka et al., 2020). Projection studies using variable-
resolution models in the North Atlantic (Stansfield et al., 2020) indicate that TC-related precipitation rates 
within North Atlantic TCs and the amount of hourly precipitation due to TC are projected to increase by the 
end of the century compared to a historical simulation. However, the annual average TC-related Rx5day over 
the eastern United States is projected to decrease because of a decrease in landfalling TCs. RCM studies with 
around 25-50 km grid spacing are used to study projected changes in TCs. The projected changes of TCs in 
Southeast Asia simulated by RCMs are consistent with those of most global climate models, showing a 
decrease in TC frequency and an increase in the amount of TC-associated precipitation or an increase in the 
frequency of intense TCs (Redmond et al., 2015; Gallo et al., 2019).  
 
Projected changes in TC tracks or TC areas of occurrence in the late 21st century vary considerably among 
available studies, although there is better agreement in the western North Pacific. Several studies project 
either poleward or eastward expansion of TC occurrence over the western North Pacific region, and more TC 
occurrence in the central North Pacific (Yamada et al., 2017; Yoshida et al., 2017; Wehner et al., 2018a; 
Roberts et al., 2020b). The observed poleward expansion of the latitude of maximum TC intensity in the 
western North Pacific is consistently reproduced by the CMIP5 models and downscaled models and these 
models show further poleward expansion in the future; the projected mean migration rate of the mean 
latitude where TCs reach their lifetime-maximum intensity is 0.2±0.1° from CMIP5 model results, while it is 
0.13±0.04° from downscaled models in the western North Pacific (Kossin et al., 2014, 2016a). In the North 
Atlantic, while the location of TC maximum intensity does not show clear poleward migration 
observationally (Kossin et al., 2014), it tends to migrate poleward in projections (Garner et al., 2017). The 
poleward migration is less robust among models and observations in the Indian Ocean, eastern North Pacific, 
and South Pacific (e.g., Tauvale and Tsuboki, 2019; Ramsay et al. 2018; Cattiaux et al. 2020). There is 
presently no clear consensus in projected changes in TC translation speed (Knutson et al., 2020), although 
recent studies suggest a slowdown outside of the tropics (Kossin, 2019; Yamaguchi et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 
2020a), but regionally there can even be an acceleration of the storms (Hassanzadeh et al., 2020). 
 
The spatial extent, or “size”, of the TC wind-field is an important determinant of storm surge and damage. 
No detectable anthropogenic influences on TC size have been identified to date, because TCs in observations 
vary in size substantially (Chan and Chan, 2015) and there is no definite theory on what controls TC size, 
although this is an area of active research (Chavas and Emanuel, 2014; Chan and Chan, 2018). However, 
projections by high-resolution models indicate future broadening of TC wind-fields when compared to TCs 
of the same categories (Yamada et al., 2017), while Knutson et al. (2015) simulates a reasonable interbasin 
distribution of TC size climatology, but projects no statistically significant change in global average TC size. 
A plausible mechanism is that as the tropopause height becomes higher with global warming, the eye wall 
areas become wider because the eye walls are inclined outward with height to the tropopause. This effect is 
only reproduced in high-resolution convection-permitting models capturing eye walls, and such modeling 
studies are not common. Moreover, the projected TC size changes are generally on the order of 10% or less, 
and these size changes are still highly variable between basins and studies. Thus, the projected change in 
both magnitude and sign of TC size is uncertain.  
 
The coastal effects of TCs depend on TC intensity, size, track, and translation speed. Projected increases in 
sea level, average TC intensity, and TC rainfall rates each generally act to further elevate future storm surge 
and fresh-water flooding (see Section 9.6.4.2). Changes in TC frequency could contribute toward increasing 
or decreasing future storm surge risk, depending on the net effects of changes in weaker vs stronger storms. 
Several studies (McInnes et al., 2014, 2016; Little et al., 2015; Garner et al., 2017; Timmermans et al., 2017, 
2018) have explored future projections of storm surge in the context of anthropogenic climate change with 
the influence of both sea level rise and future TC changes. Garner et al. (2017) investigated the near future 
changes in the New York City coastal flood hazard, and suggested a small change in storm-surge height 
because effects of TC intensification are compensated by the offshore shifts in TC tracks, but concluded that 
the overall effect due to the rising sea levels would increase the flood hazard. Future projection studies of 
storm surge in East Asia, including China, Japan and Korea, also indicate that storm surge due to TCs 
become more severe (Yang et al., 2018b; Mori et al., 2019, 2021; Chen et al., 2020c). For the Pacific islands, 
McInnes et al. (2014) found that the future projected increase in storm surge in Fiji is dominated by sea level 
rise, and projected TC changes make only a minor contribution. Among various storm surge factors, there is 
high confidence that sea level rise will lead to a higher possibility of extreme coastal water levels in most 
regions, with all other factors assumed equal.  
 
In the North Atlantic, vertical wind shear, which inhibits TC genesis and intensification, varies in a quasi-
dipole pattern with one center of action in the tropics and another along the U.S. southeast coast (Vimont and 
Kossin, 2007). This pattern of variability creates a protective barrier of high shear along the U.S. coast 
during periods of heightened TC activity in the tropics (Kossin, 2017), and appears to be a natural part of the 
Atlantic ocean-atmosphere climate system (Ting et al., 2019). Greenhouse gas forcing in CMIP5 and the 
Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE; Kay et al., 2015) simulations, however, 
erodes the pattern and degrades the natural shear barrier along the U.S. coast. Following the Representative 
Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) emission scenario, the magnitude of the erosion of the barrier equals 
the amplitude of past natural variability (time of emergence) by the mid-twenty-first century (Ting et al., 
2019). The projected reduction of shear along the U.S. East Coast with warming is consistent among studies 
(e.g., Vecchi and Soden, 2007). 
 
In summary, average peak TC wind speeds and the proportion of Category 4-5 TCs will very likely increase 
globally with warming. It is likely that the frequency of Category 4-5 TCs will increase in limited regions 
over the western North Pacific. It is very likely that average TC rain-rates will increase with warming, and 
likely that the peak rain-rates will increase at greater than the Clausius-Clapeyron scaling rate of 7% per °C 
of warming in some regions due to increased low-level moisture convergence caused by regional increases in 
TC wind-intensity. It is likely that the average location where TCs reach their peak wind-intensity will 
migrate poleward in the western North Pacific Ocean as the tropics expand with warming, and that the global 
frequency of TCs over all categories will decrease or remain unchanged.  
 
 
## 11.7.2  Extratropical storms 
 
This section focuses on extratropical cyclones (ETCs) that are either classified as strong or extreme by using 
some measure of their intensity, or by being associated with the occurrence of extremes in variables such as 
precipitation or near-surface wind speed (Seneviratne et al., 2012). Since AR5, the high relevance of ETCs 
for extreme precipitation events has been well established (Pfahl and Wernli, 2012; Catto and Pfahl, 2013; 
Utsumi et al., 2017), with 80% or more of hourly and daily precipitation extremes being associated with 
either ETCs or fronts over oceanic mid-latitude regions, and somewhat smaller, but still very large, 
proportions of events over mid-latitude land regions (Utsumi et al., 2017). The emphasis in this section is on 
individual ETCs that have been identified using some detection and tracking algorithms. Mid-latitude 
atmospheric rivers are assessed in Section 8.3.2.8. 
 
 
### 11.7.2.1  Observed trends 
 
Chapter 2 (Section 2.3.1.4.3) concluded that there is overall low confidence in recent changes in the total 
number of ETCs over both hemispheres and that there is medium confidence in a poleward shift of the storm 
tracks over both hemispheres since the 1980s. Overall, there is also low confidence in past-century trends in 
the number and intensity of the strongest ETCs due to the large interannual and decadal variability (Feser et 
al., 2015; Reboita et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Varino et al., 2018) and due to temporal and spatial 
heterogeneities in the number and type of assimilated data in reanalyses, particularly before the satellite era 
(Krueger et al., 2013; Tilinina et al., 2013; Befort et al., 2016; Chang and Yau, 2016; Wang et al., 2016). 
There is medium confidence that the agreement among reanalyses and among detection and tracking 
algorithms is higher when considering stronger cyclones (Neu et al., 2013; Pepler et al., 2015; Wang et al., 
2016). Over the Southern Hemisphere, there is high confidence that the total number of ETCs with low 
central pressures (<980 hPa) has increased between 1979 and 2009, with all eight reanalyses considered by 
Wang et al. (2016), showing positive trends and five of them showing statistically significant trends. Similar 
results were found by (Reboita et al., 2015) using a different detection and tracking algorithm and a single 
reanalysis product. Over the Northern Hemisphere, there is high agreement among reanalyses that the 
number of cyclones with low central pressures (<970 hPa) has decreased in summer and winter during the 
period 1979-2010 (Tilinina et al., 2013; Chang et al., 2016). However, changes exhibit substantial decadal 
variability and do not show monotonic trends since the 1980s. For example, over the Arctic and North 
Atlantic, Tilinina et al. (2013) showed the number of cyclones with very low central pressure (<960 hPa) 
increased from 1979 to 1990 and then declined until 2010 in all five reanalyses considered. Over the North 
Pacific, the number of cyclones with very low central pressure reached a peak around 2000 and then 
decreased until 2010 in the five reanalyses considered (Tilinina et al., 2013). 
 
Overall, however, it should be noted that characterising trends in the dynamical intensity of ETCs (e.g., wind 
speeds) using the absolute central pressure is problematic because the central pressure depends on the 
background mean sea level pressure, which varies seasonally and regionally (e.g., Befort et al., 2016).  
 
 
### 11.7.2.2  Model evaluation 
 
There is high confidence that coarse-resolution climate models (e.g., CMIP5 and CMIP6) underestimate the 
dynamical intensity of ETCs, including the strongest ETCs, as measured using a variety of metrics, including 
mean pressure gradient, mean vorticity and near-surface winds, over most regions (Colle et al., 2013; Zappa 
et al., 2013a; Govekar et al., 2014; Di Luca et al., 2016; Trzeciak et al., 2016; Seiler et al., 2018; Priestley et 
al., 2020). There is also high confidence that most current climate models underestimate the number of 
explosive systems (i.e., systems showing a decrease in mean sea level pressure of at least 24 hPa in 24 hours) 
over both hemispheres (Seiler and Zwiers, 2016a; Gao et al., 2020; Priestley et al., 2020). There is high 
confidence that the underestimation of the intensity of ETCs is associated with the coarse horizontal 
resolution of climate models, with higher horizontal resolution models, including models from HighResMIP 
and CORDEX, usually showing better performance (Colle et al., 2013; Zappa et al., 2013a; Di Luca et al., 
2016; Trzeciak et al., 2016; Seiler et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2020; Priestley et al., 2020). The improvement by 
higher-resolution models is found even when comparing models and reanalyses after postprocessing data to a 
common resolution (Zappa et al., 2013a; Di Luca et al., 2016; Priestley et al., 2020). The systematic bias in 
the intensity of ETCs has also been linked to the inability of current climate models to well resolve diabatic 
processes, particularly those related to the release of latent heat (Willison et al., 2013; Trzeciak et al., 2016) 
and the formation of clouds (Govekar et al., 2014). There is medium confidence that climate models simulate 
well the spatial distribution of precipitation associated with ETCs over the Northern Hemisphere, together 
with some of the main features of the ETC life cycle, including the maximum in precipitation occurring just 
before the peak in dynamical intensity (e.g., vorticity) as observed in a reanalysis and observations 
(Hawcroft et al., 2018). There is, however, large observational uncertainty in ETC-associated precipitation 
(Hawcroft et al., 2018) and limitations in the simulation of frontal precipitation, including too low rainfall 
intensity over mid-latitude oceanic areas in both hemispheres (Catto et al., 2015). 
 
 
### 11.7.2.3  Detection and attribution, event attribution 
 
Chapter 3 (Section 3.3.3.3) concluded that there is low confidence in the attribution of observed changes in 
the number of ETCs in the Northern Hemisphere and that there is high confidence that the poleward shift of 
storm tracks in the Southern Hemisphere is linked to human activity, mostly due to emissions of ozone-
depleting substances. Specific studies attributing changes in the most extreme ETCs are not available. The 
human influence on individual extreme ETC events has been considered only a few times and there is overall 
low confidence in the attribution of these changes (NASEM, 2016; Vautard et al., 2019). 
 
 
### 11.7.2.4  Projections 
 
The frequency of ETCs is expected to change primarily following a poleward shift of the storm tracks as 
discussed in Chapters 4 (Section 4.5.1.6, see also Figure 4.31) and 8 (Section 8.4.2.8). There is medium 
confidence that changes in the dynamical intensity (e.g., wind speeds) of ETCs will be small, although 
changes in the location of storm tracks can lead to substantial changes in local extreme wind speeds (Zappa 
et al., 2013b; Chang, 2014; Li et al., 2014; Seiler and Zwiers, 2016b; Yettella and Kay, 2017; Barcikowska 
et al., 2018; Kar-Man Chang, 2018). Yettella and Kay (2017) detected and tracked ETCs over both 
hemispheres in an ensemble of 30 CESM-LE simulations, differing only in their initial conditions, and found 
that changes in mean wind speeds around ETC centres are often negligible between present (1986-2005) and 
future (2081-2100) periods. Using 19 CMIP5 models, Zappa et al. (2013b) found an overall reduction in the 
number of cyclones associated with low-troposphere (850-hPa) wind speeds larger than 25 m s-1 over the 
North Atlantic and Europe with the number of the 10% strongest cyclones decreasing by about 8% and 6% 
in DJF and JJA according to the RCP4.5 scenario (2070-2099 vs. 1976-2005). Over the North Pacific, Chang 
(2014) showed that CMIP5 models project a decrease in the frequency of ETCs with the largest central 
pressure perturbation (i.e., the depth, strongly related with low-level wind speeds) by the end of the century 
according to simulations using the RCP8.5 scenario. Using projections from CMIP5 GCMs under the 
RCP8.5 scenario (1981-2000 to 2081-2100), Seiler and Zwiers (2016b) projected a northward shift in the 
number of explosive ETCs in the northern Pacific, with fewer and weaker events south, and more frequent 
and stronger events north of 45°N. Using 19 CMIP5 GCMs under the RCP8.5 scenario, (Kar-Man Chang, 
2018) found a significant decrease in the number of ETCs associated with extreme wind speeds (2081–2100 
vs. 1980–99) over the Northern Hemisphere (average decrease of 17%) and over some smaller regions, 
including the Pacific and Atlantic regions. 
 
Over the Southern Hemisphere, future changes (RCP8.5 scenario; 1980-1999 to 2081-2100) in extreme 
ETCs were studied by Chang (2017) using 26 CMIP5 models and a variety of intensity metrics (850-hPa 
vorticity, 850-hPa wind speed, mean sea level pressure and near-surface wind speed). They found that the 
number of extreme cyclones is projected to increase by at least 20% and as much as 50%, depending on the 
specific metric used to define extreme ETCs. Increases in the number of strong cyclones appear to be robust 
across models and for most seasons, although they show strong regional variations with increases occurring 
mostly over the southern flank of the storm track, consistent with a shift and intensification of the storm 
track. Overall, there is medium confidence that projected changes in the dynamical intensity of ETCs depend 
on the resolution and formulation (e.g., explicit or implicit representation of convection) of climate models 
(Booth et al., 2013; Michaelis et al., 2017; Zhang and Colle, 2017).  
 
As reported in AR5 and in Chapter 8 (Section 8.4.2.8), despite small changes in the dynamical intensity of 
ETCs, there is high confidence that the precipitation associated with ETCs will increase in the future (Zappa 
et al., 2013b; Marciano et al., 2015; Pepler et al., 2016; Zhang and Colle, 2017; Michaelis et al., 2017; 
Yettella and Kay, 2017; Barcikowska et al., 2018; Zarzycki, 2018; Hawcroft et al., 2018; Kodama et al., 
2019; Bevacqua et al., 2020c; Reboita et al., 2020). There is high confidence that increases in precipitation 
will follow increases in low-level water vapour (i.e., about 7% per degree of surface warming; Box 11.1) and 
will be largest for higher warming levels (Zhang and Colle, 2017). There is medium confidence that 
precipitation changes will show regional and seasonal differences due to distinct changes in atmospheric 
humidity and dynamical conditions (Zappa et al., 2015; Hawcroft et al., 2018), with even decreases in some 
specific regions such as the Mediterranean (Zappa et al., 2015; Barcikowska et al., 2018). There is high 
confidence that snowfall associated with wintertime ETCs will decrease in the future, because increases in 
tropospheric temperatures lead to a lower proportion of precipitation falling as snow (O’Gorman, 2014; 
Rhoades et al., 2018; Zarzycki, 2018). However, there is medium confidence that extreme snowfall events 
associated with wintertime ETCs will change little in regions where snowfall will be supported in the future 
(O’Gorman, 2014; Zarzycki, 2018). 
 
In summary, there is low confidence in past changes in the dynamical intensity (e.g., maximum wind speeds) 
of ETCs and medium confidence that in the future these changes will be small, although changes in the 
location of storm tracks could lead to substantial changes in local extreme wind speeds. There is high 
confidence that average and maximum ETC precipitation-rates will increase with warming, with the 
magnitude of the increases associated with increases in atmospheric water vapour. There is medium 
confidence that projected changes in the intensity of ETCs, including wind speeds and precipitation, depend 
on the resolution and formulation of climate models. 
 
 
## 11.7.3  Severe convective storms 

Severe convective storms are convective systems that are associated with extreme phenomena such as 
tornadoes, hail, heavy precipitation (rain or snow), strong winds, and lightning. The assessment of changes in 
severe convective storms in SREX (Chapter 3, Seneviratne et al., 2012) and AR5 (Chapter 12, Collins et al., 
2013) is limited and focused mainly on tornadoes and hail storms. SREX assessed that there is low 
confidence in observed trends in tornadoes and hail because of data inhomogeneities and inadequacies in 
monitoring systems. Subsequent literature assessed in the Climate Science Special Report (Kossin et al., 
2017) led to the assessment of the observed tornado activity over the 2000s in the United States with a 
decrease in the number of days per year with tornadoes and an increase in the number of tornadoes on these 
days (medium confidence). However, there is low confidence in past trends for hail and severe thunderstorm 
winds. Climate models consistently project environmental changes that would support an increase in the 
frequency and intensity of severe thunderstorms that combine tornadoes, hail, and winds (high confidence), 
but there is low confidence in the details of the projected increase. Regional aspects of severe convective 
storms and details of the assessment of tornadoes and hail are also assessed in Chapter 12 (Section 12.3.3.2 
for tornadoes; Section 12.3.4.5 for hail; Section 12.4.5.3 for Europe, Section 12.4.6.3 for North America, and 
Section 12.7.2 for regional gaps and uncertainties). 
 
 
### 11.7.3.1  Mechanisms and drivers 
 
Severe convective storms are sometimes embedded in synoptic-scale weather systems, such as TCs, ETCs, 
and fronts (Kunkel et al., 2013). They are also generated as individual events as mesoscale convective 
systems (MCSs) and mesoscale convective complexes (MCCs) (a special type of a large,organized and long-
lived MCS), without being clearly embedded within larger-scale weather systems. In addition to the general 
vigorousness of precipitation, hail, and winds associated with MCSs, characteristics of MCSs are viewed in 
new perspectives in recent years, probably because of both the development of dense mesoscale observing 
networks and advances in high-resolution mesoscale modelling (Sections 11.7.3.2 and 11.7.3.3). The 
horizontal scale of MCSs is discussed with their organization of the convective structure and it is examined 
with a concept of "convective aggregation" in recent years (Holloway et al., 2017). MCSs sometimes take a 
linear shape and stay almost stationary with successive production of cumulonimbus on the upstream side 
(back-building type convection), and cause heavy rainfall (Schumacher and Johnson, 2005). Many of the 
recent severe rainfall events in Japan are associated with band-shaped precipitation systems (Kunii et al., 
2016; Oizumi et al., 2018; Tsuguti et al., 2018; Kato, 2020), suggesting common characteristics of severe 
precipitation, at least in East Asia. The convective modes of severe storms in the United States can be 
classified into rotating or linear modes and preferable environmental conditions for these modes, such as 
vertical shear, have been identified (Trapp et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2013; Allen, 2018). Cloud microphysics 
characteristics of MCSs were examined and the roles of warm rain processes on extreme precipitation were 
emphasized recently (Sohn et al., 2013; Hamada et al., 2015; Hamada and Takayabu, 2018). Idealized 
studies also suggest the importance of ice and mixed-phase processes of cloud microphysics on extreme 
precipitation (Sandvik et al., 2018; Bao and Sherwood, 2019). However, it is unknown whether the types of 
MCSs are changing in recent periods or observed ubiquitously all over the world. 
 
Severe convective storms occur under conditions preferable for deep convection, that is, conditionally 
unstable stratification, sufficient moisture both in lower and middle levels of the atmosphere, and a strong 
vertical shear. These large-scale environmental conditions are viewed as necessary conditions for the 
occurrence of severe convective systems, or the resulting tornadoes and lightning, and the relevance of these 
factors strongly depends on the region (e.g., Antonescu et al., 2016a; Allen, 2018; Tochimoto and Niino, 
2018). Frequently used metrics are atmospheric static stability, moisture content, convective available 
potential energy (CAPE) and convective inhibition (CIN), wind shear or helicity, including storm-relative 
environmental helicity (SREH) (Tochimoto and Niino, 2018; Elsner et al., 2019). These metrics, largely 
controlled by large-scale atmospheric circulations or synoptic weather systems, such as TCs and ETCs, are 
then generally used to examine severe convective systems. In particular, there is high confidence that CAPE 
in the tropics and the subtropics increases in response to global warming (Singh et al., 2017a), as supported 
by theoretical studies (Singh and O’Gorman, 2013; Seeley and Romps, 2015; Romps, 2016; Agard and 
Emanuel, 2017). The uncertainty, however, arises from the balance between factors affecting severe storm 
occurrence. For example, the warming of mid-tropospheric temperatures leads to an increase in the freezing 
level, which leads to increased melting of smaller hailstones, while there may be some offset by stronger 
updrafts driven by increasing CAPE, which would favour the growth of larger hailstones, leading to less 
melting when falling (Allen, 2018; Mahoney, 2020).  
 
There are few studies on relations between changes in severe convective storms and those of the large-scale 
circulation patterns. Tornado outbreaks in the United States are usually associated with ETCs with their 
frontal systems and TCs (Fuhrmann et al., 2014; Tochimoto and Niino, 2016). In early June in East Asia, 
associated with the Baiu/Changma/Mei-yu, severe precipitation events are frequently caused by MCSs. 
Severe precipitation events are also caused by remote effects of TCs, known as predecessor rain events 
(PREs) (Galarneau et al., 2010). Atmospheric rivers and other coherent types of enhanced water vapour flux 
also have the potential to induce severe convective systems (Kamae et al., 2017; Ralph et al., 2018; Waliser 
and Guan, 2017; see Section 8.3.2.8.1). Combined with the above drivers, topographic effects also enhance 
the intensity and duration of severe convective systems and the associated precipitation (Ducrocq et al., 
2008; Piaget et al., 2015). However, the changes in these drivers are not generally significant, so their 
relations to severe convective storms are unclear. 
 
In summary, severe convective storms are sometimes embedded in synoptic-scale weather systems, such as 
TCs, ETCs, and fronts, and modulated by large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns. The occurrence of 
severe convective storms and the associated severe events, including tornadoes, hail, and lightning, is 
affected by environmental conditions of the atmosphere, such as CAPE and vertical shear. The uncertainty, 
however, arises from the balance between these environmental factors affecting severe storm occurrence. 
 
 
### 11.7.3.2  Observed trends 
 
Observed trends in severe convective storms or MCSs are not well documented, but the climatology of 
MCSs has been analysed in specific regions (North America, South America, Europe, Asia; regional aspects 
of convective storms are separately assessed in Chapter 12). As the definition of severe convective storms 
varies depending on the literature, it is not straightforward to make a synthesizing view of observed trends in 
severe convective storms in different regions. However, analysis using satellite observations provides a 
global view of MCSs (Kossin et al., 2017). The global distribution of thunderstorms is captured (Zipser et 
al., 2006; Liu and Zipser, 2015) by using the satellite precipitation measurements by the Tropical Rainfall 
Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) (Hou et al., 2014). The climatological 
characteristics of MCSs are provided by satellite analyses in South America (Durkee and Mote, 2010; 
Rasmussen and Houze, 2011; Rehbein et al., 2018) and those of MCC in the Maritime Continent by 
Trismidianto and Satyawardhana (2018). Analysis of the environmental conditions favourable for severe 
convective events indirectly indicates the climatology and trends of severe convective events (Allen et al., 
2018; Taszarek et al., 2018, 2019), though favourable conditions depend on the location, such as the 
difference for tornadoes associated with ETCs between the United States and Japan (Tochimoto and Niino, 
2018). 
 
Observed trends in severe convective storms are highly regionally dependent. In the United States, it is 
indicated that there is no significant increase in convective storms, and hail and severe thunderstorms 
(Kossin et al., 2017; Kunkel et al., 2013). There is an upward trend in the frequency and intensity of extreme 
precipitation events in the United States (high confidence) (Kunkel et al., 2013; Easterling et al., 2017), and 
MCSs have increased in occurrence and precipitation amounts since 1979 (limited evidence) (Feng et al., 
2016).  Significant interannual variability of hailstone occurrences is found in the Southern Great Plains of 
the United States (Jeong et al., 2020). The mean annual number of tornadoes has remained relatively 
constant, but their variability of occurrence has increased since the 1970s, particularly over the 2000s, with a 
decrease in the number of days per year, but an increase in the number of tornadoes on these days (Brooks et 
al., 2014; Elsner et al., 2015, 2019; Kossin et al., 2017; Allen, 2018). There has been a shift in the 
distribution of tornadoes, with increases in tornado occurrence in the mid-south of the US and decreases over 
the High Plains (Gensini and Brooks, 2018). Trends in MCSs are relatively more visible for particular 
aspects of MCSs, such as lengthening of active seasons and dependency on duration. MCSs have increased 
in occurrence and precipitation amounts since 1979 (Easterling et al., 2017). Feng et al. (2016) analysed that 
the observed increases in springtime total and extreme rainfall in the central United States are dominated by 
MCSs, with increased frequency and intensity of long-lasting MCSs.  
 
Studies on trends in severe convective storms and their ingredients outside of the United States are limited. 
Westra et al. (2014) found that there is an increase in the intensity of short-duration convective events 
(minutes to hours) over many regions of the world, except eastern China. In Europe, a climatology of 
tornadoes shows an increase in detected tornadoes between 1800 to 2014, but this trend might be affected by 
the density of observations (Antonescu et al., 2016b, 2016a). An increase in the trend in extreme daily 
rainfall is found in southeastern France, where MCSs play a key role in this type of event (Blanchet et al., 
2018; Ribes et al., 2019). Trend analysis of the mean annual number of days with thunderstorms since 1979 
in Europe indicates an increase over the Alps and central, southeastern, and eastern Europe, with a decrease 
over the southwest (Taszarek et al., 2019). In the Sahelian region, Taylor et al. (2017) analysed MCSs using 
satellite observations since 1982 and showed an increase in the frequency of extreme storms. In Bangladesh, 
the annual number of propagating MCSs decreased significantly during 1998-2015 based on TRMM 
precipitation data (Habib et al., 2019). Prein and Holland (2018) estimated the hail hazard from large-scale 
environmental conditions using a statistical approach and showed increasing trends in the United States, 
Europe, and Australia. However, trends in hail on regional scales are difficult to validate because of an 
insufficient length of observations and inhomogeneous records (Allen, 2018). The high spatial variability of 
hail suggests it is reasonable that there would be local signals of both positive and negative trends and the 
trends that are occurring in hail globally are uncertain. In China, the total number of days that have either a 
thunderstorm or hail have decreased by about 50% from 1961 to 2010, and the reduction in these severe 
weather occurrences correlates strongly with the weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon (Zhang et 
al., 2017b). More regional aspects of severe convective storms are detailed in Chapter 12. 
 
In summary, because the definition of severe convective storms varies depending on the literature and the 
region, it is not straightforward to make a synthesizing view of observed trends in severe convective storms 
in different regions. In particular, observational trends in tornadoes, hail, and lightning associated with 
severe convective storms are not robustly detected due to insufficient coverage of the long-term 
observations. There is medium confidence that the mean annual number of tornadoes in the United States has 
remained relatively constant, but their variability of occurrence has increased since the 1970s, particularly 
over the 2000s, with a decrease in the number of days per year and an increase in the number of tornadoes on 
these days (high confidence). Detected tornadoes have also increased in Europe, but the trend depends on the 
density of observations.  
 
 
### 11.7.3.3  Model evaluation 
 
The explicit representation of severe convective storms requires non-hydrostatic models with horizontal grid 
spacings below 5 km, denoted as convection-permitting models or storm-resolving models (Section 10.3.1). 
Convection-permitting models are becoming available to run over a wide domain, such as a continental scale 
or even over the global area, and show realistic climatological characteristics of MCSs (Prein et al., 2015; 
Guichard and Couvreux, 2017; Satoh et al., 2019). Such high-resolution simulations are computationally too 
expensive to perform at the larger domain and for long periods and alternative methods by using an RCM 
with dynamical downscaling are generally used (Section 10.3.1). Convection-permitting models are used as 
the flagship project of CORDEX to particularly study projections of thunderstorms (Section 10.3.3). 
Simulations of North American MCSs by a convection-permitting model conducted by Prein et al. (2017a) 
were able to capture the main characteristics of the observed MCSs, such as their size, precipitation rate, 
propagation speed, and lifetime. Cloud-permitting model simulations in Europe also showed sub-daily 
precipitation realistically (Ban et al., 2014; Kendon et al., 2014). Evaluation of precipitation conducted using 
convection-permitting simulations around Japan showed that finer resolution improves intense precipitation 
(Murata et al., 2017). MCSs over Africa simulated using convection-permitting models showed better 
extreme rainfall (Kendon et al., 2019) and diurnal cycles and convective rainfall over land than the coarser-
resolution RCMs or GCMs (Stratton et al., 2018; Crook et al., 2019). 
 
The other modeling approach is the analysis of the environmental conditions that control characteristics of 
severe convective storms using the typical climate model results in CMIP5/6 (Allen, 2018). Severe 
convective storms are generally formed in environments with large CAPE and tornadic storms are, in 
particular, formed with a combination of large CAPE and strong vertical wind shear. As the processes 
associated with severe convective storms occur over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, some of 
which are poorly understood and are inadequately sampled by observational networks, the model calibration 
approaches are in general difficult and insufficiently validated. Therefore, model simulations and their 
interpretations should be done with much caution.  
 
In summary, there are typically two kinds of modeling approaches for studying changes in severe convective 
storms. One is to use convection-permitting models in wider regions or the global domain in time-sliced 
downscaling methods to directly simulate severe convective storms. The other is the analysis of the 
environmental conditions that control characteristics of severe convective storms by using coarse-resolution 
GCMs. Even in finer-resolution convection-permitting models, it is difficult to directly simulate tornadoes, 
hail storms, and lightning, so modeling studies of these changes are limited. 
 
 
### 11.7.3.4  Detection and attribution, event attribution 
 
It is extremely difficult to detect differences in time and space of severe convective storms (Kunkel et al., 
2013). Although some ingredients that are favourable for severe thunderstorms have increased over the 
years, others have not; thus, overall, changes in the frequency of environments favourable for severe 
thunderstorms have not been statistically significant. Event attribution studies on severe convective events 
have now been undertaken for some cases. For the case of the July 2018 heavy rainfall event in Japan (BOX 
11.3), Kawase et al. (2019) took a storyline approach to show that the rainfall during this event in Japan was 
increased by approximately 7% due to the recent rapid warming around Japan. For the case of the December 
2015 extreme rainfall event in Chennai, India, the extremity of the event was equally caused by the warming 
trend in the Bay of Bengal SSTs and the strong El Niño conditions (van Oldenborgh et al., 2016; Boyaj et al., 
2018). For hailstorms, such as those that caused disasters in the United States in 2018, detection of the role 
of climate change in changing hail storms is more difficult, because hail storms are not, in general, directly 
simulated by convection-permitting models and not adequately represented by the environmental parameters 
of coarse-resolution GCMs (Mahoney, 2020).  
 
In summary, it is extremely difficult to detect and attribute changes in severe convective storms, except for 
case study approaches by event attribution. There is limited evidence that extreme precipitation associated 
with severe convective storms has increased in some cases. 
 
 
### 11.7.3.5  Projections 
 
Future projections of severe convective storms are usually studied either by analysing the environmental 
conditions simulated by climate models or by a time slice approach with higher-resolution convection-
permitting models by comparing simulations downscaled with climate model results under historical 
conditions and those under hypothesized future conditions (Kendon et al., 2017; Allen, 2018). Up to now, 
individual studies using convection-permitting models gave projections of extreme events associated with 
severe convective storms in local regions, and it is not generally possible to obtain global or general views of 
projected changes of severe convective storms. Prein et al. (2017b) investigated future projections of North 
American MCS simulations and showed an increase in MCS frequency and an increase in total MCS 
precipitation volume by the combined effect of increases in maximum precipitation rates associated with 
MCSs and increases in their size. Rasmussen et al. (2017) investigated future changes in the diurnal cycle of 
precipitation by capturing organized and propagating convection and showed that weak to moderate 
convection will decrease and strong convection will increase in frequency in the future. Ban et al. (2015) 
found the day-long and hour-long precipitation events in summer intensify in the European region covering 
the Alps. Kendon et al. (2019) showed future increases in extreme 3-hourly precipitation in Africa. Murata et 
al. (2015) investigated future projections of precipitation around Japan and showed a decrease in monthly 
mean precipitation in the eastern Japan Sea region in December, suggesting convective clouds become 
shallower in the future in the winter over the Japan Sea. 
 
The other approach is the projection of the environmental conditions that control characteristics of severe 
convective storms by analysing climate model results. There is high confidence that CAPE, particularly 
summertime mean CAPE and high percentiles of the CAPE in the tropics and subtropics, increases in 
response to global warming in an ensemble of climate models including those of CMIP5, mainly from 
increased low-level specific humidity (Sobel and Camargo, 2011; Singh et al., 2017a; Chen et al., 2020b). 
CIN becomes stronger over most land areas under global warming, resulting mainly from reduced low-level 
relative humidity over land (Chen et al., 2020b). However, there are large differences within the CMIP5 
ensemble for environmental conditions, which contribute to some degree of uncertainty (Allen, 2018). 
Because the relation between simulated environments in models and the occurrence of severe convective 
storms are in general insufficiently validated, the confidence level of the projection of severe convective 
storms with the approach of the environmental conditions is generally low. 
 
In the United States, projected changes in the environmental conditions show an increase in CAPE and no 
changes or decreases in the vertical wind shear, suggesting favourable conditions for an increase in severe 
convective storms in the future, but the interpretation of how tornadoes or hail will change is an open 
question because of the strong dependence on shear (Brooks, 2013). Diffenbaugh et al. (2013) showed robust 
increases in the occurrence of the favourable environments for severe convective storms with increased 
CAPE and stronger low-level wind shear in response to future global warming. A downscaling approach 
showed that the variability of the occurrence of severe convective storms increases in spring in late 21st 
century simulations (Gensini and Mote, 2015). Future changes in hail occurrence in the United States 
examined through convection-permitting dynamical downscaling suggested that the hail season may begin 
earlier in the year and exhibit more interannual variability with increases in the frequency of large hail in 
broad areas over the United States (Trapp et al., 2019). There is medium confidence that the frequency and 
variability of the favourable environments for severe convective storms will increase in spring, and low 
confidence for summer and autumn (Diffenbaugh et al., 2013; Gensini and Mote, 2015; Hoogewind et al., 
2017). The occurrence of hail events in Colorado in the United States was examined by comparing both 
present-day and projected future climates using high-resolution model simulations capable of resolving 
hailstorms (Mahoney et al., 2012), which showed hail is almost eliminated at the surface in the future in 
most of the simulations, despite more intense future storms and significantly larger amounts of hail generated 
in-cloud. 
 
Future changes in severe convection environments show enhancement of instability with less robust changes 
in the frequency of strong vertical wind shear in Europe (Púčik et al. 2017) and in Japan (Muramatsu et al. 
2016). In Japan, the frequency of conditions favourable for strong tornadoes increases in spring and partly in 
summer.  
 
In summary, the average and maximum rain rates associated with severe convective storms increase in a 
warming world in some regions including the USA (high confidence). There is high confidence from climate 
models that CAPE increases in response to global warming in the tropics and subtropics, suggesting more 
favourable environments for severe convective storms. The frequency of springtime severe convective 
storms is projected to increase in the USA leading to a lengthening of the severe convective storm season 
(medium confidence), evidence in other regions is limited. There is significant uncertainty about projected 
regional changes in tornadoes, hail, and lightning due to limited analysis of simulations using convection-
permitting models (high confidence). 
 
 
## 11.7.4  Extreme winds 
 
Extreme winds are defined here in terms of the strongest near-surface wind speeds that are generally 
associated with extreme storms, such as TCs, ETCs, and severe convective storms. In previous IPCC reports, 
near-surface wind speed (including extremes), has not been assessed as a variable in its own right, but rather 
in the context of other extreme atmospheric or oceanic phenomena. The exception was the SREX report 
(Seneviratne et al., 2012), which specifically examined past changes and projections of mean and extreme 
near-surface wind speeds. A strong decline in extreme winds compared to mean winds was reported for the 
continental northern mid-latitudes. Due to the small number of studies and uncertainties in terrestrial-based 
surface wind measurements, the findings were assigned low confidence in the SREX. AR5 reported a 
weakening of mean and maximum winds from the 1960s or 1970s to the early 2000s in the tropics and mid-
latitudes and increases in high latitudes, but with low confidence in changes in the observed surface winds 
over land (Hartmann et al., 2013). Observed trends in mean wind speed over land and the ocean are assessed 
in Section 2.3.1.4.4. Aspects of climate impact-drivers for winds are addressed in Section 12.3.3 and 12.5.2.3 
and their regional changes are assessed in Section 12.4. 
 
Observationally, although not specifically addressing extreme wind speed changes, negative surface wind 
speed trends (stilling) were found in the tropics and mid-latitudes of both hemispheres of -0.014 m s-1 year-1, 
while positive trends were reported at high latitudes poleward of 70 degrees, based on a review of 148 
studies (McVicar et al., 2012a). An earlier study attributed the stilling to both changes in atmospheric 
circulation and an increase in surface roughness due to an overall increase in vegetation cover (Vautard et 
al., 2010). Since then, a number of additional studies have mostly confirmed these general negative mean-
wind trends based on anemometer data for Spain (Azorin-Molina et al., 2017), Turkey, (Dadaser-Celik and 
Cengiz, 2014), the Netherlands, (Wever, 2012), Saudi Arabia, (Rehman, 2013), Romania, (Marin et al., 
2014), and China (Chen et al., 2013). Lin et al. (2013) note that wind speed variability over China is greater 
at high elevation locations compared to those closer to mean sea level. Hande et al. (2012), using radiosonde 
data, found an increase in surface wind speed on Macquarie Island.  
 
A number of new studies have examined surface wind speeds over the ocean based on ship-based 
measurements, satellite altimeters, and Special Sensor Microwave/Imagers (SSM/I) (Tokinaga and Xie, 
2011; Zieger et al., 2014). It has been noted that wind speed trends tend to be stronger in altimeter 
measurements, although the spatial patterns of change are qualitatively similar in both instruments (Zieger et 
al., 2014). Liu et al. (2016) found positive trends in surface wind speeds over the Arctic Ocean in 20 years of 
satellite observations. Small positive trends in mean wind speed were found in 33 years of satellite data, 
together with larger trends in the 90th percentile values over global oceans (Ribal and Young, 2019). These 
results were consistent with an earlier study that found a positive trend in 1-in-100 year wind speeds (Young 
et al., 2012). A positive change in mean wind speeds was found for the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal 
(Shanas and Kumar, 2015) and Zheng et al. (2017) found that positive wind speed trends over the ocean 
were larger during winter seasons than summer seasons. 
 
Changes in extreme winds are associated with changes in the characteristics (locations, frequencies, and 
intensities) of extreme storms, including TCs, ETCs, and severe convective storms. For TCs, as assessed in 
Section 11.7.1.5, it is projected that the average peak TC wind speeds will increase globally with warming, 
while the global frequency of TCs over all categories will decrease or remain unchanged; the average 
location where TCs reach their peak wind-intensity will migrate poleward in the western North Pacific 
Ocean as the tropics expand with warming. Frequency, intensities, and geographical distributions of extreme 
wind events associated with TCs will change according to these TC changes. For ETCs, by the end of the 
century, CMIP5 models show the number of ETCs associated with extreme winds will significantly decrease 
in the mid- and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere in winter, with the projected decrease being larger 
over the Atlantic (Kar-Man Chang, 2018), while it will significantly increase irrespective of the season in the 
Southern Hemisphere (Chang, 2017)(Section 11.7.2.4). Over the ocean in the subtropics, a large ensemble of 
60-km global model simulations indicated that extreme winds associated with storm surges will intensify 
over 15–35°N in the Northern Hemisphere (Mori et al., 2019). On the other hand, extreme surface wind 
speeds will mostly decrease due to decreases in the number and intensity of TCs over most tropical areas of 
the Southern Hemisphere (Mori et al., 2019). The projected changes in the frequency of extreme winds are 
associated with the future changes in TCs and ETCs. 
 
Extreme cyclonic windstorms that share some characteristics with both TCs and ETCs occur regularly over 
the Mediterranean Sea and are often referred to as “medicanes” (Ragone et al., 2018; Miglietta and Rotunno, 
2019; Ragone et al., 2018; Miglietta and Rotunno, 2019; Zhang et al., 2020e). Medicanes pose substantial 
threats to regional islands and coastal zones. A growing body of literature consistently found that the 
frequency of medicanes decreases under warming, while the strongest medicanes become stronger 
(González-Alemán et al., 2019; Tous et al., 2016; Romero and Emanuel, 2017; Romera et al., 2017; 
Cavicchia et al., 2014; Romero and Emanuel, 2013; Gaertner et al., 2007). This is also consistent with 
expected global changes in TCs under warming (11.7.1). Based on the consistency of these studies, it is 
likely that medicanes will decrease in frequency, while the strongest medicanes become stronger under 
warming scenario projections (medium confidence). 
 
In summary, the observed intensity of extreme winds is becoming less severe in the lower to mid-latitudes, 
while becoming more severe in higher latitudes poleward of 60 degrees (low confidence). Projected changes 
in the frequency and intensity of extreme winds are associated with projected changes in the frequency and 
intensity of TCs and ETCs (medium confidence). 
 
 
# <goto>11.8</goto>  Compound events  
 
The IPCC SREX (SREX Ch3) first defined compound events as “(1) two or more extreme events occurring 
simultaneously or successively, (2) combinations of extreme events with underlying conditions that amplify 
the impact of the events, or (3) combinations of events that are not themselves extremes but lead to an 
extreme event or impact when combined”. Further definitions of compound events have emerged since the 
SREX. Zscheischler et al. (2018) defined compound events broadly as “the combination of multiple drivers 
and/or hazards that contributes to societal or environmental risk”. This definition is used in the present 
assessment, because of its clear focus on the risk framework established by the IPCC, and also highlighting 
that compound events may not necessarily result from dependent drivers. Compound events have been 
classified into preconditioned events, where a weather-driven or climate-driven precondition aggravates the 
impacts of a hazard; multivariate events, where multiple drivers and/or hazards lead to an impact; temporally 
compounding events, where a succession of hazards leads to an impact; and spatially compounding events, 
where hazards in multiple connected locations cause an aggregated impact (Zscheischler et al., 2020). 
Drivers include processes, variables, and phenomena in the climate and weather domain that may span over 
multiple spatial and temporal scales. Hazards (such as floods, heat waves, wildfires) are usually the 
immediate physical precursors to negative impacts, but can occasionally have positive outcomes (Flach et 
al., 2018). 
 
 
## 11.8.1  Overview 
 
The combination of two or more – not necessarily extreme – weather or climate events that occur i) at the 
same time, ii) in close succession, or iii) concurrently in different regions, can lead to extreme impacts that 
are much larger than the sum of the impacts due to the occurrence of individual extremes alone. This is 
because multiple stressors can exceed the coping capacity of a system more quickly. The contributing events 
can be of similar types (clustered multiple events) or of different types (Zscheischler et al., 2020). Many 
major weather- and climate-related catastrophes are inherently of a compound nature (Zscheischler et al., 
2018). This has been highlighted for a broad range of hazards, such as droughts, heat waves, wildfires, 
coastal extremes, and floods (Westra et al., 2016; AghaKouchak et al., 2020; Ridder et al., 2020). Co-
occurring extreme precipitation and extreme winds can result in infrastructural damage (Martius et al., 
2016); the compounding of storm surge and precipitation extremes can cause coastal floods (Wahl et al., 
2015); the combination of drought and heat can lead to tree mortality (Allen et al., 2015)(see also Section 
11.6); wildfires increase occurrences of hailstorms and lightning (Zhang et al., 2019e). Compound storm 
types consisting of co-located cyclone, front and thunderstorm systems have a higher chance of causing 
extreme rainfall and extreme winds than individual storm types (Dowdy and Catto, 2017). Extremes may 
occur at similar times at different locations (De Luca et al., 2020a,b) but affect the same system, for instance, 
spatially-concurrent climate extremes affecting crop yields and food prices (Anderson et al., 2019; Singh et 
al., 2018). Studies also show an increasing risk for breadbasket regions to be concurrently affected by 
climate extremes with increasing global warming, even between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming (Gaupp et 
al., 2019) (Box 11.2). Concomitant extreme conditions at different locations become more probable as 
changes in climate extremes are emerging over an increasing fraction of the land area (Sections 11.2.3, 
11.2.4, 11.8.2, 11.8.3; Box 11.4).  
 
Finally, impacts may occur because of large multivariate anomalies in the climate drivers, if systems are 
adapted to historical multivariate climate variability (Flach et al., 2017). For instance, ecosystems are 
typically adapted to the local covariability of temperature and precipitation such that a bivariate anomaly 
may have a large impact even though neither temperature nor precipitation may be extreme based on a 
univariate assessment (Mahony and Cannon, 2018). Given that almost all systems are affected by weather 
and climate phenomena at multiple space-time scales (Raymond et al., 2020), it is natural to consider 
extremes in a compound event framework. It should be noted, however, that multi-hazard dependencies can 
also decrease risk, for instance when hazards are negatively correlated (Hillier et al., 2020). Despite this 
recognition, the literature on past and future changes in compound events has been limited, but is growing. 
This section assesses examples of types of compound events in available literature.  
 
In summary, compound events include the combination of two or more – not necessarily extreme – weather 
or climate events that occur i) at the same time, ii) in close succession, or iii) concurrently in different 
regions.  The land area affected by concurrent extremes has increased (high confidence). Concurrent extreme 
events at different locations, but possibly affecting similar sectors (e.g., breadbaskets) in different regions, 
will become more frequent with increasing global warming, in particular above +2°C of global warming 
(high confidence).   
 
 
## 11.8.2  Concurrent extremes in coastal and estuarine regions 
 
Coastal and estuarine zones are prone to a number of meteorological extreme events and also to concurrent 
extremes. A major climati-impact driver in coastal regions around the world is floods (Chapter 12), and flood 
occurrence may be influenced by the dependence between storm surge, extreme rainfall, river flow, but also 
by sea level rise, waves and tides, as well as groundwater for estuaries. Floods with multiple drivers are often 
referred to as “compound floods” (Wahl et al., 2015; Moftakhari et al., 2017; Bevacqua et al., 2020b).  
 
At US coasts, the probability of co-occurring storm surge and heavy precipitation is higher for the 
Atlantic/Gulf coast relative to the Pacific coast (Wahl et al., 2015). Furthermore, six studied locations on the 
US coast with long overlapping time series show an increase in the dependence between heavy precipitation 
and storm surge over the last century, leading to more frequent co-occurring storm surge and heavy 
precipitation events at the present day (Wahl et al., 2015). Storm surge and extreme rainfall are also 
dependent in most locations on the Australian coasts (Zheng et al., 2013) and in Europe along the Dutch 
coasts (Ridder et al., 2018), along the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic coast and the North Sea (Bevacqua et 
al., 2019). The probability of flood occurrence can be assessed via the dependence between storm surge and 
river flow (Bevacqua et al., 2020a, 2020b). For instance, the occurrence of a North Sea storm surge in close 
succession with an extreme Rhine or Meuse river discharge is much more probable due to their dependence, 
compared to if both events would be independent (Kew et al., 2013; Klerk et al., 2015). Significant 
dependence between high sea levels and high river discharge are found for more than half of the available 
station observations, which are mostly located around the coasts of North America, Europe, Australia, and 
Japan (Ward et al., 2018). Combining global river discharge with a global storm surge model, hotspots of 
compound flooding have been discovered that are not well covered by observations, including Madagascar, 
Northern Morocco, Vietnam, and Taiwan (Couasnon et al., 2020). In the Dutch Noorderzijlvest area, there is 
more than a two-fold increase in the frequency of exceeding the highest warning level compared to the case 
if storm surge and heavy precipitation were independent (van den Hurk et al., 2015). In other regions and 
seasons, the dependence can be insignificant (Wu et al., 2018b) and there can be significant seasonal and 
regional differences in the storm surge-heavy precipitation relationship. Assessments of flood probabilities 
are often not based on actual flood measurements and instead are estimated from its main drivers including 
astronomical tides, storm surge, heavy precipitation, and high streamflow. Such single driver analyses might 
underestimate flood probabilities if multiple correlated drivers contribute to flood occurrence (e.g., van den 
Hurk et al., 2015).  
 
Many coastal areas are also prone to the occurrence of compound precipitation and wind extremes, which 
can cause damage, including to infrastructure and natural environments. A high percentage of co-occurring 
wind and precipitation extremes are found in coastal regions and in areas with frequent tropical cyclones. 
Finally, the combination of extreme wave height and duration is also shown to influence coastal erosion 
processes (Corbella and Stretch, 2012).  
 
Aspects of concurrent extremes in coastal and estuarine environments have increased in frequency and/or 
magnitude over the last century in some regions. These include an increase in the dependence between heavy 
precipitation and storm surge over the last century, leading to more frequent co-occurring storm surge and 
heavy precipitation events in the present day along US coastlines (Wahl et al., 2015). In Europe, the 
probability of compound flooding occurrence increases most strongly along the Atlantic coast and the North 
Sea under strong warming. This increase is mostly driven by an intensification of precipitation extremes and 
aggravated flooding probability due to sea level rise (Bevacqua et al., 2019). At the global scale and under a 
high emissions scenario, the concurrence probability of meteorological conditions driving compound 
flooding would increase by more than 25% on average along coastlines worldwide by 2100, compared to the 
present (Bevacqua et al., 2020b). Sea level extremes and their physical impacts in the coastal zone arise from 
a complex set of atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial processes that interact on a range of spatial and 
temporal scales and will be modified by a changing climate, including sea level rise (McInnes et al., 2016). 
Interactions between sea level rise and storm surges (Little et al., 2015), and sea level and fluvial flooding 
(Moftakhari et al., 2017) are projected to lead to more frequent and more intense compound coastal flooding 
events as sea levels continue to rise.  
 
In summary, there is medium confidence that over the last century the probability of compound flooding has 
increased in some locations, including along the US coastline. There is medium confidence that the 
occurrence and magnitude of compound flooding in coastal regions will increase in the future due to both sea 
level rise and increases in heavy precipitation. 
 
 
## 11.8.3  Concurrent droughts and heat waves 
 
Concurrent droughts and heat waves have a number of negative impacts on human society and natural 
ecosystems. Studies since SREX and AR5 show several occurrences of observed combinations of drought 
and heat waves in various regions. 
 
Over most land regions, temperature and precipitation are strongly negatively correlated during summer 
(Zscheischler and Seneviratne, 2017), mostly due to land-atmosphere feedbacks (Sections 11.1.6, 11.3.2), 
but also because synoptic-scale weather systems favourable for extreme heat are also unfavourable for rain 
(Berg et al., 2015). This leads to a strong correlation between droughts and heat waves (Zscheischler and 
Seneviratne, 2017). Drought events characterized by low precipitation and extreme high temperatures have 
occurred, for example, in California (AghaKouchak et al., 2014), inland eastern Australia (King et al., 2014), 
and large parts of Europe (Orth et al., 2016b). The 2018 growing season was both record-breaking dry and 
hot in Germany (Zscheischler and Fischer, 2020). 
 
The probability of co-occurring meteorological droughts and heat waves has increased in the observational 
period in many regions and will continue to do so under unabated warming (Herrera-Estrada and Sheffield, 
2017; Zscheischler and Seneviratne, 2017; Hao et al., 2018; Sarhadi et al., 2018; Alizadeh et al., 2020; Wu et 
al., 2021). Overall, projections of increases in co-occurring drought and heat waves are reported in northern 
Eurasia (Schubert et al., 2014), Europe ; Sedlmeier et al., 2018), southeast Australia (Kirono et al., 2017), 
multiple regions of the United States (Diffenbaugh et al., 2015; Herrera-Estrada and Sheffield 2017), 
northwest China (Li et al., 2019c; Kong et al., 2020) and India (Sharma and Mujumdar, 2017). The dominant 
signal is related to the increase in heat wave occurrence, which has been attributed to anthropogenic forcing 
(11.3.4). This means that even if drought occurrence is unaffected, compound hot and dry events will be 
more frequent (Sarhadi et al., 2018; Yu and Zhai, 2020).  
 
Drought and heat waves are also associated with fire weather, related through high temperatures, low soil 
moisture, and low humidity. Fire weather refers to weather conditions conducive to triggering and sustaining 
wildfires, which generally include temperature, soil moisture, humidity, and wind (Chapter 12). Concurrent 
hot and dry conditions amplify conditions that promote wildfires (Schubert et al., 2014; Littell et al., 2016; 
Hope et al., 2019, Dowdy, 2018). Burnt area extent in western US forests (Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016) 
and particularly in California (Williams et al., 2019) has been linked to anthropogenic climate change via a 
significant increase in vapour pressure deficit, a primary driver of wildfires. A study of the western US 
examined the correlation between historical water-balance deficits and annual area burned, across a range of 
vegetation types from temperate rainforest to desert (McKenzie and Littell, 2017). The relationship between 
temperature and dryness, and wildfire, varied with ecosystem type, and the fire-climate relationship was both 
nonstationary and vegetation-dependent. In many fire-prone regions, such as the Mediterranean and China’s 
Daxing’anling region, projections for increased severity of future drought and heat waves may lead to an 
increased frequency of wildfires relative to observed (Ruffault et al., 2018; Tian et al., 2017). Observations 
show a long-term trend towards more dangerous weather conditions for bushfires in many regions of 
Australia, which is attributable at least in part to anthropogenic climate change (Dowdy, 2018). There is 
emerging evidence that recent regional surges in wildland fires are being driven by changing weather 
extremes (SRCCL Ch2, Cross-Chapter Box 3; Jia et al., 2019). Between 1979 and 2013, the global burnable 
area affected by long fire-weather seasons doubled, and the mean length of the fire-weather season increased 
by 19% (Jolly et al., 2015). However, at the global scale, the total burned area has been decreasing between 
1998 and 2015 due to human activities mostly related to changes in land use (Andela et al., 2017). Given the 
projected high confidence increase in compound hot and dry conditions, there is high confidence that fire 
weather conditions will become more frequent at higher levels of global warming in some regions. This 
assessment is also consistent with assessments of Chapter 12 for regional projected changes in fire weather. 
The SRCCL Ch2 assessed with high confidence that future climate variability is expected to enhance the risk 
and severity of wildfires in many biomes such as tropical rainforests. 
 
In summary, there is high confidence that concurrent heat waves and droughts have increased in frequency 
over the last century at the global scale due to human influence. There is medium confidence that weather 
conditions that promote wildfires (fire weather) have become more probable in southern Europe, northern 
Eurasia, the US, and Australia over the last century. There is high confidence that compound hot and dry 
conditions become more probable in nearly all land regions as global mean temperature increases. There is 
high confidence that fire weather conditions will become more frequent at higher levels of global warming in 
some regions.

# <goto>11.9</goto>  Regional information on extremes 
 
This section complements the assessments of changes in temperature extremes (Section 11.3), heavy 
precipitation (Section 11.4), and droughts (Section 11.6), by providing additional regional details. Owing to 
the large number of regions and space limitations, the regional assessment for each of the AR6 reference 
regions (see Section 1.5.2.2 for a description) is presented here in a set of tables. The tables are organized 
according to types of extremes (temperature, heavy precipitation, droughts) for Africa (Tables 11.4-11.6), 
Asia (Table 11.7-11.9), Australasia (Tables 11.10-11.12), Central and South America (Tables 11.13-11.15), 
Europe (Tables 11.16-11.18), and North America (Tables 11.19-11.21). Each table contains regional 
assessments for observed changes, the human contribution to the observed changes, and projections of 
changes in these extremes at 1.5°C, 2°C and 4°C of global warming. Expanded versions of the tables with 
full evidence and rationale for assessments are provided in the Chapter Appendix (Tables 11.A.4-11.A.21). 
 
 
## 11.9.1  Overview 
 
Sections 11.9.2, 11.9.3., and 11.9.4 provide brief summaries of the underlying evidence used to derive the 
regional assessments for temperature extremes, heavy precipitation events, and droughts, respectively. The 
assessments take into account evidence from studies based on global datasets (global studies), as well as 
regional studies. Global studies include analyses for all continents and AR6 regions with sufficient data 
coverage, and provide an important basis for cross-region consistency, as the same data and methods are 
used for all regions. However, individual regional studies may include additional information that is missed 
in global studies and thus provide an important regional calibration for the assessment. 
 
The assessments are presented using the calibrated confidence and likelihood language (Box 1.1). Low 
confidence is assessed when there is limited evidence, either because of a lack of available data in the region 
and/or a lack of relevant studies. Low confidence is also assessed when there is a lack of agreement on the 
evidence of a change, which may be due to large variability or inconsistent changes depending on the 
considered subregions, time frame, models, assessed metrics, or studies. In cases when the evidence is 
strongly contradictory, for example with substantial regional changes of opposite sign, “mixed signal” is 
indicated. With an assessment of low confidence, the direction of change is not indicated in the tables. A 
direction of change (increase or decrease) is provided with an assessment of medium confidence, high 
confidence, likely, or higher likelihood levels. Likelihood assessments are only provided in the case of high 
confidence. In some cases, there may be confidence in a small or no change. 
 
For projections, changes are assessed at three global warming levels (GWLs, CC-Box 11.1): 1.5°C, 2°C and 
4°C. Literature based both on GWL projections and on scenario-based projections is used for the 
assessments. In the case of literature on scenario-based projections, a mapping between scenarios/time 
frames and GWLs was performed as documented in CC-Box 11.1. Projections of changes in temperature and 
precipitation extremes are assessed relative to two different baselines: the recent past (1995-2014) and pre-
industrial (1850-1900). With smaller changes relative to the variability, in particular because droughts 
happen on longer timescales compared to extremes of daily temperature and precipitation, it is more difficult 
to distinguish changes in drought relative to the recent past. As such, changes in droughts are assessed 
relative to the pre-industrial baseline, unless indicated otherwise.  
 
## 11.9.2  Temperature extremes 
 
Tables 11.4, 11.7, 11.10, 11.13, 11.16, and 11.19 include assessments for past chn temperature extremes and 
their attribution, as well as future projections. The evidence is mostly drawn from changes in metrics based 
on daily maximum and minimum temperatures, similar to those used in Section 11.3. The regional 
assessments start from global studies that used consistent analyses for all regions globally with sufficient 
data. This includes Dunn et al. (2020) for observed changes and Li et al. (2020) and the Chapter 11 
Supplementary Material (11.SM) for projections with the CMIP6 multi-model ensemble. Evidence from 
regional studies, and those based on the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble or CORDEX simulations, are then 
used to refine the confidence assessments. For attribution, Seong et al. (2020) provide a consistent analysis 
for AR6 regions and Wang et al. (2017) for SREX regions. Additional regional studies, including event 
attribution analyses (Section 11.2), are used when available. In some regions that were not analysed in Seong 
et al. (2020) and with no known event attribution studies, medium confidence of a human contribution is 
assessed when there is strong evidence of changes from observations that are in the direction of model 
projected changes for the future, the magnitude of projected changes increases with global warming, and 
there is no other evidence to the contrary. Understanding of how temperature extremes change with the mean 
temperature and overwhelming evidence of a human contribution to the observed larger-scale changes in the 
mean temperature and temperature extremes further support this assessment. 
 
 
## 11.9.3  Heavy precipitation 

Tables 11.5, 11.8, 11.11, 11.14, 11.17, and 11.20 include assessments for past changes in heavy precipitation 
events and their attribution, as well as future projections. The evidence is mostly drawn from changes in 
metrics based on one-day or five-day precipitation amounts, as addressed in Section 11.4. Similar to 
temperature extremes, the assessment of changes in heavy precipitation uses global studies, including Dunn 
et al. (2020) and Sun et al. (2020) for observed changes, and Li et al. (2020) and the Chapter 11 
Supplementary Material (11.SM) for projected changes using the CMIP6 multi-model ensemble. For 
attribution, Paik et al. (2020) provided continental analyses where data coverage was sufficient, but no 
attribution studies based on global data are available for the regional scale. For each region, regional studies, 
and studies based on the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble or CORDEX simulations, are also considered in the 
assessments for past changes, attribution, and projections. 

## 11.9.4  Droughts 
 
Tables 11.6, 11.9, 11.12, 11.15, 11.18, and 11.21 provide regional tables on past, attributed and projected 
changes in droughts. The assessment is subdivided in three drought categories corresponding to four drought 
types: i) meteorological droughts, ii) agricultural and ecological droughts, and iii) hydrological droughts (see 
Section 11.6). A list of metrics and global studies used for the assessments is provided below. The evidence 
from global studies is complemented in each continent with evidence from regional studies. An overview of 
studies considered for the assessments in projections is provided in Table 11.3. 
 
Meteorological droughts are assessed based on observed and projected changes in precipitation-only metrics 
such as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Consecutive Dry Days (CDD). Observed changes are 
assessed based on two global studies, Dunn et al. (2020) for CDD and Spinoni et al. (2019) for SPI. For 
projections, evidence for changes at 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming is drawn from Xu et al. (2019) and  
Touma et al. (2015) (based on RCP8.5 for 2010-2054 compared to 1961-2005) for SPI (CMIP5) and the 
Chapter 11 Supplementary Material (11.SM) for CDD (CMIP6). For projections at 4°C of global warming, 
evidence is drawn from several sources, including Touma et al. (2015) and Spinoni et al. (2020) for SPI 
(from CMIP5 and CORDEX, respectively), and the Chapter 11 Supplementary Material (11.SM) for CDD 
(CMIP6). No global-scale studies are available for the attribution of meteorological drought, and thus this 
assessment is based on regional detection and attribution or event attribution studies. 
 
Agricultural and ecological droughts are assessed based on observed and projected changes in total column 
soil moisture, complemented by evidence on changes in surface soil moisture, water-balance (precipitation 
minus evapotranspiration (ET)) and metrics driven by precipitation and atmospheric evaporative demand 
(AED) such as the SPEI and PDSI (Section 11.6). In the case of the latter, only studies including estimates 
based on the Penman-Monteith equation (SPEI-PM and PDSI-PM) are considered because of biases 
associated with temperature-only approaches (Section 11.6). In arid regions in which AED-based metrics can 
increase strongly in projections, more weight is given to soil moisture projections. For observed changes, 
evidence is drawn from several sources: Padrón et al. (2020) for changes in precipitation minus ET, as well 
as soil moisture from the multi-model Land Surface Snow and Soil Moisture Model Intercomparison Project 
within CMIP6 (LS3MIP, Van Den Hurk et al., 2016; Chapter 11 Supplementary Material (11.SM)); Greve et 
al. (2014) for changes in precipitation minus ET, and precipitation minus AED; Spinoni et al. (2019) for 
changes in SPEI-PM; and Dai and Zhao (2017) for changes in PDSI-PM. For projections at 1.5°C of global 
warming, evidence is drawn from Xu et al. (2019) based on CMIP5 and the Chapter 11 Supplementary 
Material (11.SM) based on CMIP6 for changes in total column and surface soil moisture, and from Naumann 
et al. (2018) for changes in SPEI-PM, based on EC-Earth simulations driven with SSTs from seven CMIP5 
ESMs. For projections at 2°C of global warming, evidence is drawn from Xu et al. (2019) based on CMIP5, 
and Cook et al. (2020) (SSP1-2.6, 2071-2100 compared to pre-industrial) and the Chapter 11 Supplementary 
Material (11.SM) based on CMIP6, for changes in total column and surface soil moisture; evidence is also 
drawn from Naumann et al. (2018) for changes in SPEI-PM. For projections at 4°C of global warming, 
evidence is mostly drawn from Cook et al. (2020) (SSP3-7.0, 2071-2100) and the Chapter 11 Supplementary 
Material (11.SM) based on CMIP6 for changes in total column and surface soil moisture, and from Vicente-
Serrano et al. (2020) for changes in SPEI-PM based on CMIP5. No global-scale studies with regional-scale 
information are available for the attribution of agricultural and ecological droughts, and thus this assessment 
is based on regional detection and attribution or event attribution studies. 
 
Hydrological droughts are assessed based on observed and projected changes in low flows, complemented 
by information on changes in mean runoff. For observed changes, evidence is drawn from three studies (Dai 
and Zhao, 2017; Gudmundsson et al., 2019, 2021). For projected changes at 1.5°C of global warming, 
evidence is drawn from Touma et al. (2015) based on analyses of the Standardized Runoff Index (SRI) 
(CMIP5, based on 2010-2054 compared to 1961-2005), complemented with regional studies when available. 
For projected changes at 2°C of global warming, evidence is also drawn from Cook et al. (2020) for changes 
in runoff in CMIP6 (Scenario SSP1-2.6, 2071-2100), and from Zhai et al. (2020) for changes in low flows 
based on simulations with a single model. For projected changes at 4°C of global warming, evidence is 
drawn from Touma et al. (2015) based on CMIP5 analyses of SRI, Cook et al. (2020) for changes in surface 
and total runoff based on CMIP6, and Giuntoli et al. (2015) for changes in low flows based on the Inter-
Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP) based on six Global Hydrological Models 
(GHMs) and five GCMs, including an analysis of inter-model signal-to-noise ratio. One global-scale study 
with regional-scale information is available for the attribution of hydrological droughts (Gudmundsson et al., 
2021), but only in a few AR6 regions. This information was complemented with evidence from regional 
detection and attribution, and event attribution studies when available.
