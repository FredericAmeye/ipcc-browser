# 3.es Executive Summary 
 
The evidence for human influence on recent climate change strengthened from the IPCC Second Assessment 
Report to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, and is now even stronger in this assessment. The IPCC Second 
Assessment Report (1995) concluded ‘the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human 
influence on global climate’. In subsequent assessments (TAR, 2001; AR4, 2007 and AR5, 2013), the 
evidence for human influence on the climate system was found to have progressively strengthened. AR5 
concluded that human influence on the climate system is clear, evident from increasing greenhouse gas 
concentrations in the atmosphere, positive radiative forcing, observed warming, and physical understanding 
of the climate system. This chapter updates the assessment of human influence on the climate system for 
large-scale indicators of climate change, synthesizing information from paleo records, observations and 
climate models. It also provides the primary evaluation of large-scale indicators of climate change in this 
report, that is complemented by fitness-for-purpose evaluation in subsequent chapters. 
 
## Synthesis across the Climate System 
 
*It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the global climate system since pre-industrial 
times.* Combining the evidence from across the climate system increases the level of confidence in the 
attribution of observed climate change to human influence and reduces the uncertainties associated with 
assessments based on single variables. Large-scale indicators of climate change in the atmosphere, ocean, 
cryosphere and at the land surface show clear responses to human influence consistent with those expected 
based on model simulations and physical understanding. {3.8.1} 
 
*For most large-scale indicators of climate change, the simulated recent mean climate from the latest 
generation Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) climate models underpinning 
this assessment has improved compared to the CMIP5 models assessed in the AR5 (high confidence).*
High-resolution models exhibit reduced biases in some but not all aspects of surface and ocean climate 
(medium confidence), and most Earth system models, which include biogeochemical feedbacks, perform as 
well as their lower-complexity counterparts (medium confidence). The multi-model mean captures most 
aspects of observed climate change well (high confidence). The multi-model mean captures the proxy-
reconstructed global-mean surface air temperature (GSAT) change during past high- and low-CO2 climates 
(high confidence) and the correct sign of temperature and precipitation change in most assessed regions in 
the mid-Holocene (medium confidence). The simulation of paleoclimates on continental scales has improved 
compared to AR5 (medium confidence), but models often underestimate large temperature and precipitation 
differences relative to the present day (high confidence). {3.8.2} 
 
## Human Influence on the Atmosphere and Surface 
 
*The likely range of human-induced warming in global-mean surface air temperature (GSAT) in 2010–
2019 relative to 1850–1900 is 0.8°C–1.3°C, encompassing the observed warming of 0.9°C–1.2°C, while 
the change attributable to natural forcings is only −0.1°C–0.1°C.* The best estimate of human-induced 
warming is 1.07°C. Warming can now be attributed since 1850–1900, instead of since 1951 as done in the 
AR5, thanks to a better understanding of uncertainties and because observed warming is larger. The likely 
ranges for human-induced GSAT and global mean surface temperature (GMST) warming are equal (medium 
confidence). Attributing observed warming to specific anthropogenic forcings remains more uncertain. Over 
the same period, forcing from greenhouse gases<ref>1</ref> likely increased GSAT by 1.0°C–2.0°C, while other 
anthropogenic forcings including aerosols likely decreased GSAT by 0.0°C–0.8°C. It is very likely that 
human-induced greenhouse gas increases were the main driver<ref>2</ref> of tropospheric warming since 
comprehensive satellite observations started in 1979, and extremely likely that human-induced stratospheric 
ozone depletion was the main driver of cooling in the lower stratosphere between 1979 and the mid-1990s. 
{3.3.1} 

*The CMIP6 model ensemble reproduces the observed historical global surface temperature trend and 
variability with biases small enough to support detection and attribution of human-induced warming 
(very high confidence).* The CMIP6 multi-model mean GSAT anomaly between 1850–1900 and 2010–2019 
is close to the best estimate of observed warming, but some CMIP6 models simulate a warming that is 
outside the assessed 5–95% range of observed warming. CMIP6 models broadly reproduce surface 
temperature variations over the past millennium, including the cooling that follows periods of intense 
volcanism (medium confidence). For upper air temperature, there is medium confidence that most CMIP5 and 
CMIP6 models overestimate observed warming in the upper tropical troposphere by at least 0.1°C per 
decade over the period 1979 to 2014. The latest updates to satellite-derived estimates of stratospheric 
temperature have resulted in decreased differences between simulated and observed changes of global mean 
temperature through the depth of the stratosphere (medium confidence). {3.3.1} 
 
*The slower rate of GMST increase observed over 1998–2012 compared to 1951–2012 was a temporary 
event followed by a strong GMST increase (very high confidence).* Improved observational data sets since 
AR5 show a larger GMST trend over 1998–2012 than earlier estimates. All the observed estimates of the 
1998–2012 GMST trend lie within the 10th–90th percentile range of CMIP6 simulated trends (high 
confidence). Internal variability, particularly Pacific Decadal Variability, and variations in solar and volcanic 
forcings partly offset the anthropogenic surface warming trend over the 1998–2012 period (high confidence). 
Global ocean heat content continued to increase throughout this period, indicating continuous warming of 
the entire climate system (very high confidence). Since 2012, GMST has warmed strongly, with the past five 
years (2016–2020) being the warmest five-year period in the instrumental record since at least 1850 (high 
confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 3.1, 3.3.1; 3.5.1} 
 
*It is likely that human influence has contributed to<ref>3</ref> moistening in the upper troposphere since 1979.* 
Also, there is medium confidence that human influence contributed to a global increase in annual surface 
specific humidity, and medium confidence that it contributed to a decrease in surface relative humidity over 
mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere continents during summertime. {3.3.2} 
 
*It is likely that human influence has contributed to observed large-scale precipitation changes since the 
mid-20th century.* New attribution studies strengthen previous findings of a detectable increase in Northern 
Hemisphere mid- to high-latitude land precipitation (high confidence). Human influence has contributed to 
strengthening the zonal mean precipitation contrast between the wet tropics and dry subtropics (medium 
confidence). Yet, anthropogenic aerosols contributed to decreasing global land summer monsoon 
precipitation from the 1950s to 1980s (medium confidence). There is also medium confidence that human 
influence has contributed to high-latitude increases and mid-latitude decreases in Southern Hemisphere 
summertime precipitation since 1979 associated with the trend of the Southern Annular Mode toward its 
positive phase. Despite improvements, models still have deficiencies in simulating precipitation patterns, 
particularly over the tropical ocean (high confidence). {3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.5.2} 
 
*Human-induced greenhouse gas forcing is the main driver of the observed changes in hot and cold 
extremes on the global scale (virtually certain) and on most continents (very likely).* It is likely that human 
influence, in particular due to greenhouse gas forcing, is the main driver of the observed intensification of 
heavy precipitation in global land regions during recent decades. There is high confidence in the ability of 
models to capture the large-scale spatial distribution of precipitation extremes over land. The magnitude and 
frequency of extreme precipitation simulated by CMIP6 models are similar to those simulated by CMIP5 
models (high confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 3.2} 
 
*It is likely that human influence has contributed to the poleward expansion of the zonal mean Hadley 
cell in the Southern Hemisphere since the 1980s.* There is medium confidence that the observed poleward 
expansion of the zonal mean Hadley cell in the Northern Hemisphere is within the range of internal 
variability. The causes of the observed strengthening of the Pacific Walker circulation since the 1980s are 
not well understood, and the observed strengthening trend is outside the range of trends simulated in the 
coupled models (medium confidence). While CMIP6 models capture the general characteristics of the 
tropospheric large-scale circulation (high confidence), systematic biases exist in the mean frequency of 
atmospheric blocking events, especially in the Euro-Atlantic sector, some of which reduce with increasing 
model resolution (medium confidence). {3.3.3} 
 
## Human Influence on the Cryosphere 
 
*It is very likely that anthropogenic forcing, mainly due to greenhouse gas increases, was the main 
driver of Arctic sea ice loss since the late 1970s.* There is new evidence that increases in anthropogenic 
aerosols have offset part of the greenhouse gas-induced Arctic sea ice loss since the 1950s (medium 
confidence). In the Arctic, despite large differences in the mean sea ice state, loss of sea ice extent and 
thickness during recent decades is reproduced in all CMIP5 and CMIP6 models (high confidence). By 
contrast, global climate models do not generally capture the small observed increase in Antarctic sea ice 
extent during the satellite era, and there is low confidence in attributing the causes of this change. {3.4.1} 
 
*It is very likely that human influence contributed to the observed reductions in Northern Hemisphere 
spring snow cover since 1950.* The seasonal cycle in Northern Hemisphere snow cover is better reproduced 
by CMIP6 than by CMIP5 models (high confidence). Human influence was very likely the main driver of the 
recent global, near-universal retreat of glaciers. It is very likely that human influence has contributed to the 
observed surface melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet over the past two decades, and there is medium 
confidence in an anthropogenic contribution to recent overall mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet. 
However, there is only limited evidence, with medium agreement, of human influence on Antarctic Ice Sheet 
mass balance through changes in ice discharge. {3.4.2, 3.4.3} 
 
## Human Influence on the Ocean  
 
*It is extremely likely that human influence was the main driver of the ocean heat content increase 
observed since the 1970s, which extends into the deeper ocean (very high confidence).* Since AR5, there 
is improved consistency between recent observed estimates and model simulations of changes in upper 
(<700 m) ocean heat content, when accounting for both natural and anthropogenic forcings. Updated 
observations and model simulations show that warming extends throughout the entire water column (high 
confidence), with CMIP6 models simulating 58% of industrial-era heat uptake (1850 to 2014) in the upper 
layer (0–700 m), 21% in the intermediate layer (700–2000 m) and 22% in the deep layer (>2000 m). The 
structure and magnitude of multi-model mean ocean temperature biases have not changed substantially 
between CMIP5 and CMIP6 (medium confidence). {3.5.1} 
 
*It is extremely likely that human influence has contributed to observed near-surface and subsurface 
oceanic salinity changes since the mid-20th century.* The associated pattern of change corresponds to fresh 
regions becoming fresher and salty regions becoming saltier (high confidence). Changes to the coincident 
atmospheric water cycle and ocean–atmosphere fluxes (evaporation and precipitation) are the primary 
drivers of the observed basin-scale salinity changes (high confidence). The observed depth-integrated basin-
scale salinity changes have been attributed to human influence, with CMIP5 and CMIP6 models able to 
reproduce these patterns only in simulations that include greenhouse gas increases (medium confidence). The 
basin-scale changes are consistent across models and intensify through the historical period (high 
confidence). The structure of the biases in the multi-model mean has not changed substantially between 
CMIP5 and CMIP6 (medium confidence). {3.5.2} 
 
*Combining the attributable contributions from glaciers, ice sheet surface mass balance and thermal 
expansion, it is very likely that human influence was the main driver of the observed global mean sea 
level rise since at least 1970.* Since the AR5, studies have shown that simulations that exclude 
anthropogenic greenhouse gases are unable to capture the sea level rise due to thermal expansion 
(thermosteric) during the historical period and that model simulations that include all forcings 
(anthropogenic and natural) most closely match observed estimates. It is very likely that human influence 
was the main driver of the observed global mean thermosteric sea level increase since 1970. {3.5.3, 3.5.1, 
3.4.3} 
 
*While observations show that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) has 
weakened from the mid-2000s to the mid-2010s (high confidence) and the Southern Ocean upper 
overturning cell has strengthened since the 1990s (low confidence), observational records are too short 
to determine the relative contributions of internal variability, natural forcing, and anthropogenic 
forcing to these changes (high confidence).* No changes in Antarctic Circumpolar Current transport or 
meridional position have been observed. The mean zonal and overturning circulations of the Southern Ocean 
and the mean overturning circulation of the North Atlantic (AMOC) are broadly reproduced by CMIP5 and 
CMIP6 models. However, biases are apparent in the modelled circulation strengths (high confidence) and 
their variability (medium confidence). {3.5.4} 
 
## Human Influence on the Biosphere  
 
*The main driver of the observed increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 is 
enhanced fertilization of plant growth by the increasing concentration of atmospheric CO2 (medium 
confidence).* However, there is only low confidence that this CO2 fertilization has also been the main driver 
of observed greening because land management is the dominating factor in some regions. Earth system 
models simulate globally averaged land carbon sinks within the range of observation-based estimates (high 
confidence), but global-scale agreement masks large regional disagreements. {3.6.1} 
 
*It is virtually certain that the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 was the main driver of the observed 
acidification of the global ocean.* The observed increase in CO2 concentration in the subtropical and 
equatorial North Atlantic since 2000 is likely associated in part with an increase in ocean temperature, a 
response that is consistent with the expected weakening of the ocean carbon sink with warming. Consistent 
with AR5 there is medium confidence that deoxygenation in the upper ocean is due in part to human 
influence. There is high confidence that Earth system models simulate a realistic time evolution of the global 
mean ocean carbon sink. {3.6.2} 
 
## Human Influence on Modes of Climate Variability  
 
*It is very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed trend towards the positive phase 
of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) since the 1970s and to the associated strengthening and 
southward shift of the Southern Hemispheric extratropical jet in austral summer.* The influence of 
ozone forcing on the SAM trend has been small since the early 2000s compared to earlier decades, 
contributing to a weaker SAM trend observed over 2000–2019 (medium confidence). Climate models 
reproduce the summertime SAM trend well, with CMIP6 models outperforming CMIP5 models (medium 
confidence). By contrast, the cause of the Northern Annular Mode (NAM) trend towards its positive phase 
since the 1960s and associated northward shifts of Northern Hemispheric extratropical jet and storm track in 
boreal winter is not well understood. Models reproduce observed spatial features and variance of the SAM 
and NAM very well (high confidence). {3.3.3, 3.7.1, 3.7.2} 
 
*Human influence has not affected the principal tropical modes of interannual climate variability or 
their associated regional teleconnections beyond the range of internal variability (high confidence).* 
Further assessment since the AR5 confirms that climate and Earth system models are able to reproduce most 
aspects of the spatial structure and variance of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Basin and 
Dipole modes (medium confidence). However, despite a slight improvement in CMIP6, some underlying 
processes are still poorly represented. In the Tropical Atlantic basin, which contains the Atlantic Zonal and 
Meridional modes, major biases in modelled mean state and variability remain. {3.7.3 to 3.7.5} 
 
*There is medium confidence that anthropogenic and volcanic aerosols contributed to observed changes 
in the Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (AMV) index and associated regional teleconnections since 
the 1960s, but there is low confidence in the magnitude of this influence.* There is high confidence that 
internal variability is the main driver of Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV) observed since pre-industrial 
times, despite some modelling evidence for potential human influence. Uncertainties remain in quantification 
of the human influence on AMV and PDV due to brevity of the observational records, limited model 
performance in reproducing related sea surface temperature anomalies despite improvements from CMIP5 to 
CMIP6 (medium confidence), and limited process understanding of their key drivers. {3.7.6, 3.7.7} 
 

# 3.1  Scope and Overview 
 
This chapter assesses the extent to which the climate system has been affected by human influence and to 
what extent climate models are able to simulate observed mean climate, changes and variability. This 
assessment is the basis for understanding what impacts of anthropogenic climate change may already be 
occurring and informs our confidence in climate projections. Moreover, an understanding of the amount of 
human-induced global warming to date is key to assessing our status with respect to the Paris Agreement 
goals of holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and 
pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C (COP21, UNFCCC (2015)). 
 
The evidence of human influence on the climate system has strengthened progressively over the course of 
the previous five IPCC assessments, from the Second Assessment Report that concluded ‘the balance of 
evidence suggests a discernible human influence on climate’ through to the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) 
which concluded that ‘it is extremely likely that human influence caused more than half of the observed 
increase in global mean surface temperature (GMST) from 1951 to 2010’ (see also Sections 1.3.4 and 
3.3.1.1). AR5 concluded that climate models had been developed and improved since the Fourth Assessment 
Report (AR4) and were able to reproduce many features of observed climate. Nonetheless, several 
systematic biases were identified (Flato et al., 2013). This chapter additionally builds on the assessment of 
attribution of global temperatures contained in the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C 
(SR1.5; IPCC, 2018), assessments of attribution of changes in the ocean and cryosphere in the IPCC Special 
Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC; IPCC, 2019), and assessments of 
attribution in changes in the terrestrial carbon cycle in the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land 
(IPCC, 2019a). 
 
This chapter assesses the evidence for human influence on observed large-scale indicators of climate change 
that are described in Cross-Chapter Box 2.2 and assessed in Chapter 2. It takes advantage of the longer 
period of record now available in many observational datasets. The assessment of the human-induced 
contribution to observed climate change requires an estimate of the expected response to human influence, as 
well as an estimate of the expected climate evolution due to natural forcings and an estimate of variability 
internal to the climate system (internal climate variability). For this we need high quality models, primarily 
climate and Earth system models. Since the AR5, a new set of coordinated model results from the World 
Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6; Eyring et 
al.,2016a) has become available. Together with updated observations of large-scale indicators of climate 
change (Chapter 2), CMIP simulations are a key resource for assessing human influences on the climate 
system. Pre-industrial control and historical simulations are of most relevance for model evaluation and 
assessment of internal variability, and these simulations are evaluated to assess fitness-for-purpose for 
attribution, which is the focus of this chapter (see also Section 1.5.4). This chapter provides the primary 
evaluation of large-scale indicators of climate change in this report, and is complemented by other fitness-
for-purpose evaluations in subsequent chapters. CMIP6 also includes an extensive set of idealized and single 
forcing experiments for attribution (Eyring et al., 2016a; Gillett et al., 2016a). In addition to the assessment 
of model performance and human influence on the climate system during the instrumental era up to the 
present-day, this chapter also includes evidence from paleo-observations and simulations over past millennia 
(Kageyama et al., 2018a).  
 
Whereas in previous IPCC Assessment Reports the comparison of simulated and observed climate change 
was done separately in a model evaluation chapter and a chapter on detection and attribution, in AR6 these 
comparisons are integrated together. This has the advantage of allowing a single discussion of the full set of 
explanations for any inconsistency in simulated and observed climate change, including missing forcings, 
errors in the simulated response to forcings, and observational errors, as well as an assessment of the 
application of detection and attribution techniques to model evaluation. Where simulated and observed 
changes are consistent, this can be interpreted both as supporting attribution statements, and as giving 
confidence in simulated future change in the variable concerned (see also Box 4.1). However, if a model’s 
simulation of historical climate change has been tuned to agree with observations, or if the models used in an 
attribution study have been selected or weighted on the basis of the realism of their simulated climate 
response, this information would need to be considered in the assessment and any attribution results 
correspondingly tempered. An integrated discussion of evaluation and attribution supports such a robust and 
transparent assessment. 
 
This chapter starts with a brief description of methods for detection and attribution of observed changes in 
Section 3.2, which builds on the more general introduction to attribution approaches in Cross-Working 
Group Box: Attribution (Chapter 1). In this chapter we assess the detection of anthropogenic influence on 
climate on large spatial scales and long temporal scales, a concept related to, but distinct from, that of 
emergence of anthropogenically-induced climate change from the range of internal variability on local scales 
and shorter timescales (Section 1.4.2.2). The following sections address the climate system component-by-
component, in each case assessing human influence and evaluating climate models’ simulations of the 
relevant aspects of climate and climate change. This chapter assesses the evaluation and attribution of 
continental and ocean basin-scale indicators of climate change in the atmosphere and at the Earth’s surface 
(Section 3.3), cryosphere (Section 3.4), ocean (Section 3.5), and biosphere (Section 3.6), and the evaluation 
and attribution of modes of variability (Section 3.7), the period of slower warming in the early 21st century 
(Cross-Chapter Box 3.1) and large-scale changes in extremes (Cross-Chapter Box 3.2). Model evaluation 
and attribution on sub-continental scales are not covered here, since these are assessed in the Atlas and in 
Chapter 10, and extreme event attribution is not covered since it is assessed in Chapter 11. Section 3.8 
assesses multivariate attribution and integrative measures of model performance based on multiple variables, 
as well as process representation in different classes of models. The chapter structure is summarised in 
Figure 3.1.

# 3.2  Methods 
 
New methods for model evaluation that are used in this chapter are described in Section 1.5.4. These include 
new techniques for process-based evaluation of climate and Earth system models against observations that 
have rapidly advanced since the publication of AR5 (Eyring et al., 2019) as well as newly developed CMIP 
evaluation tools that allow a more rapid and comprehensive evaluation of the models with observations 
(Eyring et al., 2016b, 2016a). 
 
In this chapter, we use the Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool, Eyring et al. (2020); Lauer et 
al. (2020); Righi et al. (2020)) and the NCAR Climate Variability Diagnostic Package (CVDP, Phillips et al., 
2014) that is included in the ESMValTool to produce most of the figures. This ensures traceability of the 
results and provides an additional level of quality control. The ESMValTool code to produce the figures in 
this chapter is released as open source software at the time of the publication of AR6 (see details in the 
Chapter Data Table, Table SM.3.1). Figures in this chapter are produced either using one ensemble member 
from each model, or using all available ensemble members and weighting each simulation by 1/(𝑁𝑁𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖), 

where N is the number of models and Mi is the ensemble size of the ith model, prior to calculating means and 
percentiles. Both approaches ensure that each model used is given equal weight in the figures, and details on 
which approach is used are provided in the figure captions. 
 
An introduction to recent developments in detection and attribution methods in the context of this report is 
provided in Cross-Working Group Box: Attribution (in Chapter 1). Here we discuss new methods and 
improvements applicable to the attribution of changes in large-scale indicators of climate change which are 
used in this chapter. 

## 3.2.1  Methods Based on Regression 
 
Regression-based methods, also known as fingerprinting methods, have been widely used for detection of 
climate change and attribution of the change to different external drivers. Initially, these methods were 
applied to detect changes in global surface temperature, and were then extended to other climate variables at 
different time and spatial scales (e.g., Hegerl et al., 1996; Hasselmann, 1997; Allen and Tett, 1999; Gillett et 
al., 2003b; Zhang et al., 2007; Min et al., 2008a, 2011). These approaches are based on multivariate linear 
regression and assume that the observed change consists of a linear combination of externally forced signals 
plus internal variability, which generally holds for large-scale variables (Hegerl and Zwiers, 2011). The 
regressors are the expected space-time response patterns to different climate forcings (fingerprints), and the 
residuals represent internal variability. Fingerprints are usually estimated from climate model simulations 
following spatial and temporal averaging. A regression coefficient which is significantly different from zero 
implies that a detectable change is identified in the observations. When the confidence interval of the 
regression coefficient includes unity and is inconsistent with zero, the magnitude of the model simulated 
fingerprints is assessed to be consistent with the observations, implying that the observed changes can be 
attributed in part to a particular forcing. Variants of linear regression have been used to address uncertainty 
in the fingerprints due to internal variability (Allen and Stott, 2003) as well as the structural model 
uncertainty (Huntingford et al., 2006). 
 
In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, observations and model-simulated responses are usually 
normalized by an estimate of internal variability derived from climate model simulations. This procedure 
requires an estimate of the inverse covariance matrix of the internal variability, and some approaches have 
been proposed for more reliable estimation of this (Ribes et al., 2009). A signal can be spuriously detected 
due to too small noise, and hence simulated internal variability needs to be evaluated with care. Model-
simulated variability is typically checked through comparing modelled variance from unforced simulations 
with the observed residual variance using a standard residual consistency test (Allen and Tett, 1999b), or an 
improved one (Ribes and Terray, 2013). Imbers et al. (2014) tested the sensitivity of detection and attribution 
results to the different representations of internal variability associated with short-memory and long-memory 
processes. Their results supported the robustness of previous detection and attribution statements for the 
global mean temperature change but they also recommended the use of a wider variety of robustness tests. 
 
Some recent studies focused on the improved estimation of the scaling factor (regression coefficient) and its 
confidence interval. Hannart et al. (2014) describe an inference procedure for scaling factors which avoids 
making the assumption that model error and internal variability have the same covariance structure. An 
integrated approach to optimal fingerprinting was further suggested in which all uncertainty sources (i.e., 
observational error, model error, and internal variability) are treated in one statistical model without a 
preliminary dimension reduction step (Hannart, 2016). Katzfuss et al. (2017) introduced a similar integrated 
approach based on a Bayesian model averaging. On the other hand, DelSole et al. (2019) suggested a 
bootstrap method to better estimate the confidence intervals of scaling factors even in a weak-signal regime. 
It is notable that some studies do not optimise fingerprints, as uncertainty in the covariance introduces a 
further layer of complexity, but results in only a limited improvement in detection (Polson and Hegerl, 
2017).  
 
Another fingerprinting approach uses pattern similarity between observations and fingerprints, in which the 
leading empirical orthogonal function obtained from the time-evolving multi-model forced simulation is 
usually defined as a fingerprint (e.g., Santer et al., 2013; Marvel et al., 2019; Bonfils et al., 2020). 
Observations and model simulations are then projected onto the fingerprint to measure the degree of spatial 
pattern similarity with the expected physical response to a given forcing. This projection provides the signal 
time series, which is in turn tested against internal variability, as estimated from long control simulations. As 
a way to extend this pattern-based approach to a high-dimensional detection variable at daily timescales, 
Sippel et al. (2019, 2020) proposed using the relationship pattern with a global climate change metric as a 
fingerprint. To solve the high-dimensional regression problem which makes regression coefficients not well 
constrained, they incorporated a statistical learning technique based on a regularized linear regression, which 
optimizes a global warming signal by giving lower weight to regions with large internal variability.  

## 3.2.2  Other Probabilistic Approaches 
 
Considering the difficulty in accounting for climate modelling uncertainties in the regression-based 
approaches, Ribes et al. (2017) introduced a new statistical inference framework based on an additivity 
assumption and likelihood maximization, which estimates climate model uncertainty based on an ensemble 
of opportunity and tests whether observations are inconsistent with internal variability and consistent with 
the expected response from climate models. The method was further developed by Ribes et al. (2021), who 
applied it to narrow the uncertainty range in the estimated human-induced warming. Hannart and Naveau 
(2018), on the other hand, extended the application of standard causal theory (Pearl, 2009) to the context of 
detection and attribution by converting a time series into an event, and calculating the probability of 
causation, an approach which maximizes the causal evidence associated with the forcing. On the other hand, 
Schurer et al. (2018) employed a Bayesian framework to explicitly consider climate modelling uncertainty in 
the optimal regression method. Application of these approaches to attribution of large-scale temperature 
changes supports the dominant anthropogenic contribution to the observed global warming. 
 
Climate change signals can vary with time and discriminant analysis has been used to obtain more accurate 
estimates of time-varying signals, and has been applied to different variables such as seasonal temperatures 
(Jia and DelSole, 2012) and the South Asian monsoon (Srivastava and DelSole, 2014). The same approach 
was applied to separate aerosol forcing responses from other forcings (Yan et al., 2016b) and results using 
climate model output indicated that detectability of the aerosol response is maximised by using a 
combination of temperature and precipitation data. Paeth et al. (2017) introduced a detection and attribution 
method applicable for multiple variables based on a discriminant analysis and a Bayesian classification 
method. Finally, a systematic approach has been proposed to translating quantitative analysis into a 
description of confidence in the detection and attribution of a climate response to anthropogenic drivers 
(Stone and Hansen, 2016). 
 
Overall, these new fingerprinting and other probabilistic methods for detection and attribution as well as 
efforts to better incorporate the associated uncertainties have addressed a number of shortcomings in 
previously applied detection and attribution techniques. They further strengthen the confidence in attribution 
of observed large-scale changes to a combination of external forcings as assessed in the following sections. 
 
 
# 3.3  Human Influence on the Atmosphere and Surface 
 
## 3.3.1  Temperature 
 
### 3.3.1.1  Surface Temperature 
 
Surface temperature change is the aspect of climate in which the climate research community has had most 
confidence over past IPCC Assessment Reports. This confidence comes from the availability of longer 
observational records compared to other indicators, a large response to anthropogenic forcing compared to 
variability in the global mean, and a strong theoretical understanding of the key thermodynamics driving its 
changes (Collins et al., 2010; Shepherd, 2014). AR5 assessed that it was extremely likely that human 
activities had caused more than half of the observed increase in global mean surface temperature from 1951 
to 2010, and virtually certain that internal variability alone could not account for the observed global 
warming since 1951 (Bindoff et al., 2013). The AR5 also assessed with very high confidence that climate 
models reproduce the general features of the global-scale annual mean surface temperature increase over 
1850-2011 and with high confidence that models reproduce global and Northern Hemisphere (NH) 
temperature variability on a wide range of time scales (Flato et al., 2013). This section assesses the 
performance of the new generation CMIP6 models (see Table AII.5) in simulating the patterns, trends, and 
variability of surface temperature, and the evidence from detection and attribution studies of human 
influence on large-scale changes in surface temperature. 
 
#### Model evaluation 

To be fit for detecting and attributing human influence on globally-averaged surface temperatures, climate 
models need to represent, based on physical principles, both the response of surface temperature to external 
forcings and the internal variability in surface temperature over various time scales. This section assesses the 
performance of those aspects in the latest generation CMIP6 climate models. See Section 3.8 for evaluation 
at continental scales, Chapter 10 for model evaluation in the context of regional climate information, and the 
Atlas for region-by-region assessments of model performance. 
 
Reconstructions of past temperature from paleoclimate proxies (Cross-Chapter Box 2.1, Section 2.3.1.1) 
have been used to evaluate modelled past climate temperature change patterns. The AR5 found that CMIP5 
(Taylor et al., 2012) models were able to reproduce the large-scale patterns of temperature during the Last 
Glacial Maximum (LGM) (Flato et al., 2013) and simulated a polar amplification broadly consistent with 
reconstructions for warm (Pliocene and Eocene) and cold (LGM) periods (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013a). 
Since AR5, a better understanding of temperature proxies and their uncertainties and in some cases the 
forcing applied to model simulations has led to better agreement between models and reconstructions over a 
wide range of past climates. For the Pliocene and Eocene warm periods, understanding of uncertainties in 
temperature proxies (Hollis et al., 2019; McClymont et al., 2020) and the boundary conditions used in 
climate simulations (Haywood et al., 2016; Lunt et al., 2017) has improved, and some models now agree 
better with temperature proxies for these time periods compared to models assessed in AR5 (Zhu et al., 
2019; Haywood et al., 2020; Lunt et al., 2021) (Sections 7.4.4.1.2; 7.4.4.2.2; Cross-Chapter Box 2.4). For the 
Last Interglacial (LIG), improved temporal resolution of temperature proxies (Capron et al., 2017) and better 
appreciation of the importance of freshwater forcing (Stone et al., 2016) have clarified the reasons behind 
apparent model-data inconsistencies. Regional LIG temperature responses simulated by CMIP6 are within 
the uncertainty ranges of reconstructed temperature responses, except in regions where unresolved changes 
in regional ocean circulation, meltwater, or vegetation changes may cause model mismatches (Otto-Bliesner 
et al., 2021). For the LGM, the CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensembles compare similarly to new sea surface 
temperature (SST) and surface air temperature (SAT) proxy reconstructions (Cleator et al., 2020; Tierney et 
al., 2020b) (Figure 3.2a). The very cold CMIP6 LGM simulation by CESM2.1 is an exception related to the 
high Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) of that model (Section 7.5.6) (Kageyama et al., 2021a; Zhu et 
al., 2021). Figure 3.2a illustrates the wide range of simulated global LGM temperature responses in both 
ensembles. CMIP6 models tend to underestimate the cooling over land, but agree better with oceanic 
reconstructions. For the mid-Holocene, the regional biases found in CMIP5 simulations are similar to those 
in pre-industrial and historical simulations (Harrison et al., 2015; Ackerley et al., 2017), suggesting common 
causes. CMIP5 models underestimate Arctic warming in the mid-Holocene (Yoshimori and Suzuki, 2019). 
CMIP6 models simulate a mid-latitude, subtropical, and tropical cooling compared to pre-industrial, whereas 
temperature proxies indicate a warming (Brierley et al., 2020; Kaufman et al., 2020; see also Section 
2.3.1.1.2), although accounting for seasonal effects in the proxies may reduce the discrepancy (Bova et al., 
2021). Over the past millennium, reconstructed and simulated temperature anomalies, internal variability, 
and forced response agree well over NH continents, but those statistics disagree strongly in the Southern 
Hemisphere (SH), where models seem to overestimate the response (PAGES 2k-PMIP3, 2015). That 
disagreement is partly explained by the lower quality of the reconstructions in the SH, but model and/or 
forcing errors may also contribute (Neukom et al., 2018). Figure 3.2b shows that land/sea warming contrast 
behaves coherently in model simulations across multiple periods, with a slight non-linearity in land warming 
due to a smaller contribution of snow cover to temperature response in warmer climates. A metric-based 
assessment of paleoclimate model simulations is carried out in Section 3.8.2. 
 
<figref>3.2</figref> 
 
For the historical period, AR5 assessed with very high confidence that CMIP5 models reproduced observed 
large-scale mean surface temperature patterns, although errors of several degrees appear in elevated regions, 
like the Himalayas and Antarctica, near the edge of the sea ice in the North Atlantic, and in upwelling 
regions. This assessment is updated here for the CMIP6 simulations. Figure 3.3 shows the annual-mean 
surface air temperature at 2 m for the CMIP5 and CMIP6 multi-model means, both compared to the ERA5 
reanalysis (see Section 1.5.2) for the period 1995-2014. The distribution of biases is similar in CMIP5 and 
CMIP6 models, as already noted by several studies (Crueger et al., 2018; Găinuşă-Bogdan et al., 2018; 
Kuhlbrodt et al., 2018; Lauer et al., 2018). Arctic temperature biases seem more widespread in both 
ensembles than assessed at the time of the AR5. The fundamental causes of temperature biases remain 
elusive, with errors in clouds (Lauer et al., 2018), oceanic circulation (Kuhlbrodt et al., 2018), winds (Lauer 
et al., 2018), and surface energy budget (Hourdin et al., 2015; Séférian et al., 2016; Găinuşă-Bogdan et al., 
2018) being frequently cited candidates. Increasing horizontal resolution shows promise of decreasing long-
standing biases in surface temperature over large regions (Bock et al., 2020). Panels e and f of Figure 3.3 
show that biases in the mean High-Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP, Haarsma et al., 
2016) models (see also Table AII.6) are smaller than those in the mean of the corresponding lower-resolution 
versions of the same models simulating the same period (see also Section 3.8.2.2). However, the bias 
reduction is modest (Palmer and Stevens, 2019). In addition, the biases of the limited number of models 
participating in HighResMIP are not entirely representative of overall CMIP6 biases, especially in the 
Southern Ocean, as indicated by comparing panels b and f of Figure 3.3. 
 
<figref>3.3</figref> 
 
AR5 assessed with very high confidence that models reproduce the general history of the increase in global-
scale annual mean surface temperature since the year 1850, although AR5 also reported that an observed 
reduction in the rate of warming over the period 1998-2012 was not reproduced by the models (Flato et al., 
2013) (see Cross-Chapter Box 3.1). Figure 3.2c and Figure 3.4 show time series of anomalies in annually 
and globally averaged surface temperature simulated by CMIP5 and CMIP6 models for the past millennium 
and the period 1850 to 2020, respectively, with the baseline set to 1850-1900 (see Section 1.4.1). As also 
indicated by Figure 3.4, the spread in simulated absolute temperatures is large (Palmer and Stevens, 2019). 
But the discussion is based on temperature anomaly time series instead of absolute temperatures because our 
focus is on evaluation of the simulation of climate change in these models, and also because anomalies are 
more uniformly distributed and are more easily deseasonalised to isolate long-term trends (see Section 
1.4.1). CMIP6 models broadly reproduce surface temperature variations over the past millennium, including 
the cooling that follows periods of intense volcanism (medium confidence) (Figure 3.2c). Simulated GMST 
anomalies are well within the uncertainty range of temperature reconstructions (medium confidence) since 
about the year 1300, except for some short periods immediately following large volcanic eruptions, for 
which simulations driven by different forcing datasets disagree (Figure 3.2c). Before the year 1300, larger 
disagreements between models and temperature reconstructions can be expected because forcing and 
temperature reconstructions are increasingly uncertain further back in time, but specific causes have not been 
identified conclusively (Ljungqvist et al., 2019; PAGES 2k Consortium, 2019) (medium confidence). For the 
historical period, results for CMIP6 shown in Figure 3.4 suggest that the qualitative history of surface 
temperature increase is well reproduced, including the increase in warming rates beginning in the 1960s and 
the temporary cooling that follows large volcanic eruptions.  
 
Although virtually all CMIP6 modelling groups report improvements in their model’s ability to simulate 
current climate compared to the CMIP5 version (Gettelman et al., 2019; Golaz et al., 2019; Mauritsen et al., 
2019; Swart et al., 2019; Voldoire et al., 2019b; Wu et al., 2019c; Bock et al., 2020; Boucher et al., 2020a; 
Dunne et al., 2020), it does not necessarily follow that the simulation of temperature trends is also improved 
(Bock et al., 2020; Fasullo et al., 2020). The CMIP6 multi-model ensemble encompasses observed warming 
and the multi-model mean tracks those observations within 0.2°C over most of the historical period. 
Figure 3.4 confirms the findings of Papalexiou et al. (2020), who highlighted based on 29 CMIP6 models 
that most models replicate the period of slow warming between 1942 and 1975 and the late twentieth century 
warming (1975–2014). The CMIP6 multi-model mean is cooler over the period 1980-2000 than both 
observations and CMIP5 (Bock et al., 2020; Flynn and Mauritsen, 2020; Gillett et al., 2021; Figure 3.4). 
Biases of several tenths of a degree in some CMIP6 models over that period may be due to an overestimate 
in aerosol radiative forcing (Andrews et al., 2020; Dittus et al., 2020; Flynn and Mauritsen, 2020) (see also 
Section 6.3.5, Figure 6.8, and Section 7.3.3). Papalexiou et al. (2020), Stolpe et al. (2020) and Tokarska et al. 
(2020) all report that CMIP6 models on average overestimate warming from the 1970s or 1980s to the 
2010s, although quantitative conclusions depend on which observational dataset is compared against (see 
also Table 2.4). However, Figure 3.4, which includes a larger number of models than available to those 
studies, indicates that the average CMIP6 model tracks observed warming better than CMIP5 models after 
the year 2000. The CMIP6 multi-model mean GSAT warming between 1850-1900 and 2010-2019 and 
associated 5-95% range is 1.09°C (0.66 to 1.64°C). Cross-Chapter Box 2.3 assessed GSAT warming over the 
same period at 1.06°C (0.88 to 1.21°C). So some CMIP6 models simulate a warming that is smaller than the 
assessed observed range, and other CMIP6 models simulate a warming that is larger. That overestimated 
warming may be an early symptom of overestimated equilibrium climate sensitivities (ECS) in some CMIP6 
models (Meehl et al., 2020; Schlund et al., 2020) (see also Section 7.5.6), and has implications for 
projections of GSAT changes (see Chapter 4) (Liang et al., 2020; Nijsse et al., 2020; Tokarska et al., 2020; 
Ribes et al., 2021). In some models, a large ECS and a strong aerosol forcing lead to too large a mid-20th 
century cooling followed by overestimated warming rates in the late 20th century when aerosol emissions 
decrease (Golaz et al., 2019; Flynn and Mauritsen, 2020). Temperature biases are driven by both model 
physics and prescribed forcing, which is a challenge for model development.  
 
Chylek et al. (2020) argue that CMIP5 models overestimate the temperature response to volcanic eruptions. 
Lehner et al. (2016), Rypdal (2018) and Stolpe et al. (2020) point instead to missed compensating effects on 
surface temperature change associated with the El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) or the Atlantic 
Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). An alternative view sees those ENSO and AMO responses as expressions 
of changes in climate feedbacks driven by the geographical pattern of SST changes (Andrews et al., 2018). 
At least one model is able to reproduce such pattern effects (Gregory and Andrews, 2016). Errors in the 
volcanic forcing prescribed in simulations, including for CMIP6 (Rieger et al., 2020), also introduce 
differences with the observed temperature response, independently of the quality of the model physics. In 
addition, comparisons of the modelled temperature response to large eruptions over the past millennium to 
temperature reconstructions based on tree rings show a much better agreement (Lücke et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 
2020a) than comparisons to the annual, multi-temperature proxy reconstructions shown in Figure 3.2c. These 
considerations, and Figures 3.2c and 3.4, suggest that CMIP6 models do not systematically overestimate the 
cooling that follows large volcanic eruptions (see also Cross-Chapter Box 4.1). 
 
When interpreting model simulations of historical temperature change, it is important to keep in mind that 
some models are tuned towards representing the observed trend in global mean surface temperature over the 
historical period (Hourdin et al., 2017). In Figure 3.4 the CMIP6 models that are documented to be tuned to 
reproduce observed warming, typically by tuning aerosol forcing or factors that influence the model’s ECS, 
are marked with an asterisk. Such tuning of a model can strongly impact its temperature projections 
(Mauritsen and Roeckner, 2020). However, Bock et al. (2020) reported that there is no statistically 
significant difference in multi-model mean GSAT between the models that had been tuned based on 
observed warming compared to those which had not. Moreover, only two of thirteen models used for the 
DAMIP simulations on which CMIP6 attribution studies are based were tuned towards historical warming 
(Bock et al., 2020; Gillett et al., 2021). Further, tuning is done on globally averaged quantities, so does not 
substantially change the spatio-temporal pattern of response on which many regression-based attribution 
studies are based (Bock et al., 2020). Therefore, we assess with high confidence that the tuning of a small 
number of CMIP6 models to observed warming has not substantially influenced attribution results assessed 
in this chapter. 
 
<figref>3.4</figref> 
 
The reliance of detection and attribution studies on climate models (see Section 3.2) requires that those 
models simulate realistic statistics of internal variability on multi-decadal timescales. An incorrect estimate 
of variability in models would affect confidence in the conclusions from detection and attribution. AR5 
found that CMIP5 models simulate realistic variability in global-mean surface temperature on decadal time 
scales, with variability on multi-decadal time scales being more difficult to evaluate because of the short 
observational record (Flato et al., 2013). Since AR5, new work has characterized the contributions of 
variability in different ocean areas to SST variability, with tropical modes of variability like ENSO dominant 
on time scales of 5 to 10 years, while longer time scales see the variance maxima move poleward to the 
North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern oceans (Monselesan et al., 2015). There may, however, be 
sizeable, two-way interdependencies between ENSO and sea surface temperature variability in different 
basins (Kumar et al., 2014; Cai et al., 2019), and ENSO’s influence on global surface temperature variability 
may not be confined only to decadal timescales (Triacca et al., 2014). Studies based on large ensembles of 
20th and 21st century climate change simulations confirm that internal variability has a substantial influence 
on global warming trends over periods shorter than 30-40 years (Kay et al., 2015; Dai and Bloecker, 2019). 
Although the equatorial Pacific seems to be the main source of internal variability on decadal timescales, 
Brown et al. (2016) linked diversity in modelled oceanic convection, sea ice, and energy budget in high-
latitude regions to overall diversity in modelled internal variability. 
 
Interest in internal variability since publication of the AR5 stems in part from its importance in 
understanding the slower global surface temperature warming over the early 21st century (see Cross-Chapter 
Box 3.1). Evidence coming mostly from paleo studies is mixed on whether CMIP5 models underestimate 
decadal and multi-decadal variability in global mean temperature. Schurer et al. (2013) found good 
agreement between internal variability derived from paleo reconstructions, estimated as the fraction of 
variance that is not explained by forced responses, and modelled variability, although the subset of CMIP5 
models they used may have been associated with larger variability than the full CMIP5 ensemble. PAGES 2k 
Consortium (2019) found that the largest 51-year trends in both reconstructions of global mean temperature 
and fully forced climate simulations over the period 850 to 1850 were almost identical. Zhu et al. (2019a) 
showed agreement in the modelled and reconstructed temporal spectrum of global surface temperatures on 
annual to multi-millennial timescales. However, they suggest that decadal-to-centennial variability is partly 
forced by slow orbital changes that predate the last millennium. This is consistent with Gebbie and Huybers 
(2019), who showed that the deep ocean has been out of equilibrium over that period. Laepple and Huybers 
(2014) found good agreement between modelled and proxy-derived decadal ocean temperature variability, 
but underestimates of variance by models by at least a factor of ten at centennial timescales because models 
underestimate the difference between the warm and cold periods of the last millennium. Parsons et al. (2020) 
found that some CMIP6 models exhibit much higher multidecadal variability in GSAT than CMIP5 models, 
with indications that variability in these models is also higher than that from proxy reconstructions. CMIP6 
models may not share the underestimation by CMIP5 models of variability in decadal to multidecadal modes 
of variability, such as Pacific decadal variability (Section 3.7.6) (England et al., 2014; Thompson et al., 
2014; Schurer et al., 2015) and Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV, which may be partly forced, see 
Section 3.7.7) but this assessment is limited by the small number of available studies. For the SH, Hegerl et 
al. (2018) found an instance of internal variability in the early 20th century larger than that modelled, but 
indicated that could be an observational issue. Friedman et al. (2020) found biases in interhemispheric SST 
contrast in some models that may be consistent with underestimated cooling after early-20th century 
eruptions or underestimated Pacific decadal variability, but could also be due to an imperfect separation 
between internal variability and forced signal in the observations. Figure 3.2c, updated from PAGES 2k 
Consortium (2019), compares modelled temperatures to reconstructions over the last millennium. It indicates 
that models reproduce the observed variability well, at least for the timescales between 20 and 50 years that 
paleo reconstructions typically resolve and that the figure represents. In summary, decadal GMST variability 
simulated in CMIP6 models spans the range of residual decadal variability in large-scale reconstructions 
(medium evidence, low agreement). 
 
In addition, new literature suggests that anthropogenic forcing itself may locally increase or decrease 
variability in surface temperatures (Screen et al., 2014; Qian and Zhang, 2015; Brown et al., 2017; Park et 
al., 2018; Santer et al., 2018; Weller et al., 2020). Those studies imply limitations in the use of pre-industrial 
control simulations to quantify the role of unforced variability over the historical period. Some recent 
attribution studies (Gillett et al., 2021; Ribes et al., 2021) have estimated variability from ensembles of 
forced simulations instead, which would be expected to resolve any such changes in variability.  
 
Figure 3.5 shows the standard deviation of zonal-mean surface temperature in CMIP6 pre-industrial control 
simulations and observed temperature datasets. Results are consistent with those based on CMIP5 models, 
which showed the largest model spread where variability is also large, in the tropics and mid- to high-
latitudes (Flato et al., 2013). Modelled variability is within a factor two of observed variability over most of 
the globe. The apparent overestimation of high latitude variability in models compared to observations may 
be due to interpolation and infilling over data sparse high latitude regions in the observational products 
shown here (Jones, 2016). 
 
<figref>3.5</figref> 
 
The previous paragraph took an ensemble-mean view of model performance, but individual models disagree 
on unforced variability. Figure 3.6 illustrates the large differences in GSAT variability in unforced CMIP6 
pre-industrial control simulations, following the method of Parsons et al. (2020). Surface temperatures in 
pre-industrial conditions are especially variable in the ten models highlighted in Figure 3.6a, and some 
models substantially exceed the variability seen in CMIP5 models (Parsons et al., 2020). Figure 3.6b shows 
that the distribution of warming trends simulated by CMIP6 models in historical simulations is clearly 
distinct from that simulated in unforced piControl simulations. Still, the unforced variability of the five most 
variable models approaches half that observed over the historical period under anthropogenically forced 
conditions (Figure 3.6c) (Parsons et al., 2020; Ribes et al., 2021). For the Centre National de la Recherche 
Météorologique (CNRM) models, which are among the most variable, the large, low-frequency variability is 
attributed to strong simulated Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (Séférian et al., 2019; Voldoire et al., 
2019b), which is difficult to disprove because of the short observational record (Cassou et al., 2018; 
Section 3.7.7). But, importantly, patterns of temperature variability simulated by even the most variable 
models differ from the pattern of forced temperature change (Parsons et al., 2020). Taken together, this 
discussion and Figures 3.2, 3.5 and 3.6 indicate that the statistics of internal variability in models compare 
well in most cases to observational estimates and temperature proxy reconstructions, though some CMIP6 
models appear to have higher multidecadal variability than CMIP5 models or proxy reconstructions. When 
used in attribution studies, models with overestimated variability would increase estimated uncertainties and 
make results statistically conservative.  
 
<figref>3.6</figref> 
 
In summary, there is high confidence that CMIP6 models reproduce observed large-scale mean surface 
temperature patterns and internal variability as well as their CMIP5 predecessors, but with little evidence for 
reduced biases. CMIP6 models also reproduce historical GSAT changes similarly to their CMIP5 
counterparts (medium confidence). However, in spite of model imperfections, there is very high confidence 
that biases in surface temperature trends and variability simulated by the CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensembles are 
small enough to support detection and attribution of human-induced warming. 
 
#### Detection and attribution 

Looking at periods preceding the instrumental record, AR5 assessed with high confidence that the 20th 
century annual mean surface temperature warming reversed a 5000-year cooling trend in NH mid-to-high 
latitudes caused by orbital forcing, and attributed the reversal to anthropogenic forcing with high confidence 
(see also Section 2.3.1.1). Since AR5, the combined response to solar, volcanic and greenhouse gas forcing 
was detected in all NH continents (PAGES 2k-PMIP3, 2015) over the period 864 to 1840. In contrast, the 
effect of those forcings was not detectable in the SH (Neukom et al., 2018). Global and NH temperature 
changes from reconstructions over this period have been attributed mostly to volcanic forcing (Schurer et al., 
2014a; McGregor et al., 2015; Otto-Bliesner et al., 2016; PAGES 2k Consortium, 2019; Büntgen et al., 
2020), with a smaller role for changes in greenhouse forcing, and solar forcing playing a minor role (Schurer 
et al., 2014b; PAGES 2k Consortium, 2019). 
 
Focusing now on warming over the historical period, AR5 assessed that it was extremely likely that human 
influence was the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century, and that it was 
virtually certain that warming over the same period cannot be explained by internal variability alone. Since 
AR5 many new attribution studies of changes in global surface temperature have focused on methodological 
advances (see also Section 3.2). Those advances include better accounting for observational and model 
uncertainties, and internal variability (Ribes and Terray, 2013; Hannart, 2016; Ribes et al., 2017; Schurer et 
al., 2018); formulating the attribution problem in a counterfactual framework (Hannart and Naveau, 2018); 
and reducing the dependence of the attribution on uncertainties in climate sensitivity and forcing (Otto et al., 
2015; Haustein et al., 2017, 2019). Studies now account for the uncertainties in the statistics of internal 
variability, either explicitly (Hannart, 2016; Hannart and Naveau, 2018; Ribes et al., 2021) or implicitly 
(Ribes and Terray, 2013; Schurer et al., 2018; Gillett et al., 2021), thus addressing concerns about over-
confident attribution conclusions. Accounting for observational uncertainty increases the range of warming 
attributable to greenhouse gases by only 10 to 30% (Jones and Kennedy, 2017; Schurer et al., 2018). While 
some attribution studies estimate attributable changes in globally-complete GSAT (Schurer et al., 2018; 
Gillett et al., 2021; Ribes et al., 2021), others attribute changes in observational GMST, but this makes little 
difference to attribution conclusions (Schurer et al., 2018). Moreover, based on a synthesis of observational 
and modelling evidence, Cross-Chapter Box 2.3 assesses that the current best estimate of the scaling factor 
between GMST and GSAT is one, and therefore attribution studies of GMST and GSAT are here treated 
together in deriving assessed warming ranges. Studies also increasingly validate their multi-model 
approaches using imperfect model tests (Schurer et al., 2018; Gillett et al., 2021; Ribes et al., 2021). 
Alternative techniques, based purely on statistical or econometric approaches, without the need for climate 
modelling, have also been applied (Estrada et al., 2013; Stern and Kaufmann, 2014; Dergiades et al., 2016) 
and match the results of physically-based methods. The larger range of attribution techniques and 
improvements to those techniques increase confidence in the results compared to AR5. 
 
In contrast, studies published since the AR5 indicate that closely constraining the separate contributions of 
greenhouse gas changes and aerosol changes to observed temperature changes remains challenging. 
Attribution of warming to greenhouse gas forcing is made as early as the end of the 19th century (Schurer et 
al., 2014b; Owens et al., 2017; PAGES 2k Consortium, 2019). Hegerl et al. (2019) found that volcanism 
cooled global temperatures by about 0.1°C between 1870 and 1910, then a lack of volcanic activity warmed 
temperatures by about 0.1°C between 1910 and 1950, with aerosols cooling temperatures throughout the 20th 
century, especially between 1950 and 1980 when the estimated range of aerosol cooling was about 0.1 to 
0.5°C. Jones et al. (2016a) attributed a warming of 0.87 to 1.22°C per century over the period 1906 to 2005 
to greenhouse gases, partially offset by a cooling of −0.54 to −0.22°C per century attributed to aerosols. But 
they also found that detection of the greenhouse gas or the aerosol signal often fails, because of uncertainties 
in modelled patterns of change and internal variability. That point is illustrated by Figure 3.7, which shows 
two- and three-way fingerprinting regression coefficients for 13 CMIP6 models and the corresponding 
attributable warming ranges, derived using HadCRUT4 (Gillett et al., 2021). Regression coefficients with an 
uncertainty range that includes zero mean that detection has failed. Models with regression coefficients 
significantly less than 1 significantly overpredict the temperature response to the corresponding forcing. 
Conversely, models with regression coefficients significantly greater than 1 underpredict the response to 
these forcings. While estimates of warming attributable to anthropogenic influence derived using individual 
models are generally consistent, estimates of warming attributable to greenhouse gases and aerosols 
separately based on individual models are not all consistent, and detection of the aerosol influence fails more 
often than that of greenhouse gases. Hence, results of recent studies emphasize the need to use multi-model 
means to better constrain estimates of GSAT changes attributable to greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing 
(Schurer et al., 2018; Gillett et al., 2021; Ribes et al., 2021).  
 
<figref>3.7</figref> 
 
Figure 3.8 compares attributable trends in globally-complete GSAT for the period 2010-2019 compared to 
1850-1900 from three detection and attribution studies, two of which use CMIP6 multi-model means (Gillett 
et al., 2021; Ribes et al., 2021), and an estimate based on assessed effective radiative forcing and transient 
and equilibrium climate sensitivity (see Section 7.3.5.3). The reference period 1850-1900 is used to assess 
attributable temperature changes because this is when the earliest gridded surface temperature records start, 
this is when the CMIP6 historical simulations start, this is the earliest base period used in attribution 
literature, and this is a reference period used in IPCC SR1.5 and earlier reports. It should however be noted 
that Cross-Chapter Box 1.2 assesses with medium confidence that there was an anthropogenic warming with 
a likely range of 0.0°C-0.2°C between 1750 and 1850-1900. Figure 3.8 also shows the GSAT changes 
directly simulated in response to these forcings in thirteen CMIP6 models. In spite of their different 
methodologies and input datasets, the three attribution approaches yield very similar results, with the 
anthropogenic attributable warming range encompassing observed warming, and the natural attributable 
warming being close to zero. The warming driven by greenhouse gas increases is offset in part by cooling 
due to other anthropogenic forcing agents, mostly aerosols, although uncertainties in these contributions are 
larger than the uncertainty in the net anthropogenic warming, as discussed above. Estimates based on 
physical understanding of forcing and ECS made by Chapter 7 are close to estimates from attribution studies, 
despite being the products of a different approach. This agreement enhances confidence in the magnitude and 
causes of attributable surface temperature warming. 
 
<figref>3.8</figref> 
 
The AR5 found high confidence for a major role for anthropogenic forcing in driving warming over each of 
the inhabited continents, except for Africa where they found only medium confidence because of limited data 
availability (Bindoff et al., 2013). At the hemispheric scale, Friedman et al. (2020) and Bonfils et al. (2020) 
detected an anthropogenically forced response of inter-hemispheric contrast in surface temperature change, 
which has a complex time evolution but showing the NH cooling more than the SH until around 1975 but 
then warming after that. Bonfils et al. (2020) attribute the NH reversal to a combination of reduced aerosol 
forcing and greenhouse gas induced warming of NH land masses. Friedman et al. (2020) found that CMIP5 
models simulate the correct sign of the inter-hemispheric contrast when forced with all forcings but 
underestimate its magnitude. Figure 3.9 shows global surface temperature change in CMIP6 all-forcing and 
natural-only simulations globally, averaged over continents, and separately over land and ocean surfaces. 
All-forcing simulations encompass observed temperature changes for all regions, while natural-only 
simulations fail to do so in recent decades except in Antarctica, based on the annual means shown. As stated 
above, warming results from a partial offset of greenhouse warming by aerosol cooling. That offset is 
stronger over land than ocean. Regionally, models show a large range of possible temperature responses to 
greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing, which complicates single-forcing attribution. A more detailed discussion 
of regional attribution can be found in Section 10.4. Over global land surfaces, Chan and Wu (2015) used 
CMIP5 simulations to attribute a warming trend of 0.3 (2.5%–97.5% confidence interval: 0.2–0.36) °C per 
decade to anthropogenic forcing, with natural forcing only contributing 0.05 (0.02–0.06) °C per decade. 
Accounting for unsampled sources of uncertainty and the availability of only a single study, their result 
suggests that it is very likely that human influence is the main driver of warming over land. 
 
<figref>3.9</figref> 
 
In summary, since the publication of the AR5, new literature has emerged which better accounts for 
methodological and climate model uncertainties in attribution studies (Ribes et al., 2017; Hannart and 
Naveau, 2018) and concluded that anthropogenic warming is approximately equal to observed warming over 
the 1951-2010 period. The IPCC SR1.5 reached the same conclusion for 2017 relative to 1850-1900 based 
on anthropogenic warming and associated uncertainties calculated using the method of Haustein et al. 
(2017). Moreover, the improved understanding of the causes of the apparent slowdown in warming over the 
beginning of the 21st century and the difference in simulated and observed warming trends over this period 
(Cross-Chapter Box 3.1) further improve our confidence in the assessment of the dominant anthropogenic 
contribution to observed warming. In deriving our assessments, these considerations are balanced against 
new literature that raises questions about the ability of some models to simulate variability in surface 
temperatures over a range of time scales (Laepple and Huybers, 2014; Parsons et al., 2017; Friedman et al., 
2020), and the finding that some CMIP6 models exhibit substantially higher multidecadal internal variability 
than that seen in CMIP5, which remains to be fully understood (Parsons et al., 2020; Ribes et al., 2021). 
Further, uncertainties in simulated aerosol-cloud interactions are still large (Section 7.3.3.2.2), resulting in 
very diverse spatial responses of different climate models to aerosol forcing and differences in the historical 
global mean temperature evolution and in diagnosed cooling attributable to aerosol (Figure 3.8). Moreover, 
like previous generations of coupled model simulations, historical and single forcing CMIP6 simulations 
follow a common experimental design (Eyring et al., 2016a; Gillett et al., 2016b) and are thus all driven by 
the same common set of forcings, even though these forcings are uncertain. Hence, forcing uncertainty is not 
directly accounted for in most of the attribution and model evaluation studies assessed here, although this 
limitation can to some extent be addressed by comparing with previous generation multi-model ensembles or 
individual model studies using different sets of forcings. 
 
The IPCC SR1.5 best estimate and likely range of anthropogenic attributable GMST warming was 1.0±0.2°C 
in 2017 with respect to the period 1850-1900. Here, the best estimate is expressed in terms of GSAT and is 
calculated as the average of the three estimates shown in Figure 3.9, yielding a value of 1.07°C. Ranges for 
attributable GSAT warming are derived by finding the smallest ranges with a precision of 0.1°C which span 
all of the 5-95% ranges from the attribution studies shown in Figure 3.9. These ranges are then assessed as 
likely rather than very likely because the studies may underestimate the importance of the structural 
limitations of climate models, which probably do not represent all possible sources of internal variability; use 
too simple climate models, which may underestimate the role of internal variability; or underestimate model 
uncertainty, especially when using model ensembles of limited size and inter-dependent models, for example 
through common errors in forcings across models, as discussed above. This leads to a likely range for 
anthropogenic attributable warming in 2010-2019 relative to 1850-1900 of 0.8 to 1.3°C in terms of GSAT. 
Consequently, that range encompasses the best estimate and very likely range of observed GSAT warming of 
1.06 °C [0.88 to 1.21 °C] over the same period (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3). There is medium confidence that the 
best estimate and likely ranges of attributable warming expressed in terms of GMST are equal to those for 
GSAT (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3). Repeating the process for other time periods leads to the best estimates and 
likely ranges listed in Table 3.1. GSAT change attributable to natural forcings is −0.1 to 0.1°C. The likely 
range of GSAT warming attributable to greenhouse gases is assessed in the same way to be 1.0 to 2.0°C 
while the GSAT change attributable to aerosols, ozone and land-use change is −0.8 to 0.0°C. Progress in 
attribution techniques allows the important advance of attributing observed surface temperature warming 
since 1850-1900, instead of since 1951 as was done in the AR5.  
 
<tableref>3.1</tableref> 
 
The IPCC AR5 assessed the likely range of the contribution of internal variability to GMST warming to be 
−0.1 to 0.1°C over the period 1951-2010. Since then, several studies have downplayed the contribution of 
internal modes of variability to global temperature variability, often by arguing for a forced component to 
those internal modes (Mann et al., 2014; Folland et al., 2018; Haustein et al., 2019; Liguori et al., 2020). 
Haustein et al. (2017) found a 5-95% confidence interval of −0.09 to +0.12 °C for the contribution of internal 
variability to warming between 1850–1879 and 2017. Ribes et al. (2021) imply a contribution of internal 
variability of −0.02 ± 0.16°C to warming between 2010-2019 and 1850-1900, assuming independence 
between errors in the observations and in the estimate of the forced response. Based on these studies, but 
allowing for unsampled sources of error, we assess the likely range of the contribution of internal variability 
to GSAT warming between 2010-2019 and 1850-1900 to be −0.2 to 0.2°C. 
 
The IPCC SR1.5 gave a likely range for the human-induced warming rate of 0.1°C to 0.3°C per decade in 
2017, with a best estimate of 0.2°C per decade (Allen et al., 2018). Table 3.1 lists the estimates of 
attributable anthropogenic warming rate over the period 2010-2019 by the three studies that underpin the 
assessment of GSAT warming (Haustein et al., 2017; Gillett et al., 2021; Ribes et al., 2021). Estimates from 
Haustein et al. (2017), based on observed warming, and Ribes et al. (2021), based on CMIP6 simulations 
constrained by observed warming, are in good agreement. Gillett et al. (2021), also based on CMIP6 models, 
corresponds to a larger anthropogenic attributable warming rate, because of a smaller warming rate attributed 
to natural forcing than in Ribes et al. (2021). This disagreement does not support a decrease in uncertainty 
compared to the SR1.5 assessment. So the range for anthropogenic attributable surface temperature warming 
rate of 0.1°C to 0.3°C per decade is again assessed to be likely, with a best estimate of 0.2°C per decade. 
 
 
### 3.3.1.2  Upper-Air Temperature 
 
Chapter 2 assessed that the troposphere has warmed since at least the 1950s, that it is virtually certain that 
the stratosphere has cooled, and that there is medium confidence that the upper troposphere in the tropics has 
warmed faster than the near-surface since at least 2001 (Section 2.3.1.2). The AR5 assessed that 
anthropogenic forcings, dominated by greenhouse gases, likely contributed to the warming of the troposphere 
since 1961 and that anthropogenic forcings, dominated by the depletion of the ozone layer due to ozone-
depleting substances, very likely contributed to the cooling of the lower stratosphere since 1979. Since the 
AR5, understanding of observational uncertainties in the radiosonde and satellite data has improved with 
more available data and longer coverage, and differences between models and observations in the tropical 
atmosphere have been investigated further. 
 
#### Tropospheric temperature 
The AR5 assessed with low confidence that most, though not all, CMIP3 (Meehl et al., 2007) and CMIP5 
(Taylor et al., 2012) models overestimated the observed warming trend in the tropical troposphere during the 
satellite period 1979-2012, and that a third to a half of this difference was due to an overestimate of the SST 
trend during this period (Flato et al., 2013). Since the AR5, additional studies based on CMIP5 and CMIP6 
models show that this warming bias in tropospheric temperatures remains. Recent studies have investigated 
the role of observational uncertainty, the model response to external forcings, the influence of the time 
period considered, and the role of biases in SST trends in contributing to this bias.  
 
Several studies since AR5 have continued to demonstrate an inconsistency between simulated and observed 
temperature trends in the tropical troposphere, with models simulating more warming than observations 
(Mitchell et al., 2013, 2020, Santer et al., 2017a, 2017b; McKitrick and Christy, 2018; Po-Chedley et al., 
2021). Santer et al. (2017b) used updated and improved satellite retrievals to investigate model performance 
in simulating the tropical mid- to upper-troposphere trends, and removed the influence of stratospheric 
cooling by regression. These factors were found to reduce the size of the discrepancy in mid- to upper-
tropospheric temperature trends between models and observations over the satellite era, but a discrepancy 
remained. Santer et al. (2017a) found that during the late 20th century, the discrepancies between simulated 
and satellite-derived mid- to upper-tropospheric temperature trends were consistent with internal variability, 
while during most of the early 21st century, simulated tropospheric warming is significantly larger than 
observed, which they relate to systematic deficiencies in some of the external forcings used after year 2000 
in the CMIP5 models. However, in CMIP6, differences between simulated and observed upper tropospheric 
temperature trends persist despite updated forcing estimates (Mitchell et al., 2020). Figure 3.10 shows that 
CMIP6 models forced by combined anthropogenic and natural forcings overestimate temperature trends 
compared to radiosonde data (Haimberger et al., 2012) throughout the tropical troposphere (Mitchell et al., 
2020). Over the 1979-2014 period, models are more consistent with observations in the lower troposphere, 
and least consistent in the upper troposphere around 200 hPa, where biases exceed 0.1°C per decade. Several 
studies using CMIP6 models suggest that differences in climate sensitivity may be an important factor 
contributing to the discrepancy between the simulated and observed tropospheric temperature trends 
(McKitrick and Christy, 2020; Po-Chedley et al., 2021), though it is difficult to deconvolve the influence of 
climate sensitivity, changes in aerosol forcing and internal variability in contributing to tropospheric 
warming biases (Po-Chedley et al., 2021). Another study found that the absence of a hypothesized negative 
tropical cloud feedback could explain half of the upper troposphere warming bias in one model (Mauritsen 
and Stevens, 2015).  
 
Mitchell et al. (2013) and Mitchell et al. (2020) found a smaller discrepancy in tropical tropospheric 
temperature trends in models forced with observed SSTs (see also Figure 3.10a), and CMIP5 models and 
observations were found to be consistent below 150 hPa when viewed in terms of the ratio of temperature 
trends aloft to those at the surface (Mitchell et al., 2013). Flannaghan et al. (2014) and Tuel (2019) showed 
that most of the tropospheric temperature difference between CMIP5 models and the satellite-based trend 
over the 1970-2018 period is due to respective differences in SST warming trends in regions of deep 
convection, and Po-Chedley et al. (2021) show that CMIP6 models with a more realistic SST simulation in 
the central and eastern Pacific show a better performance than other models. Though systematic biases still 
remain, this indicates that the bias in tropospheric temperature warming in models is in part linked to surface 
temperature warming biases, especially in the lower troposphere.  
 
In summary, studies continue to find that CMIP5 and CMIP6 model simulations warm more than 
observations in the tropical mid- and upper-troposphere over the 1979-2014 period (Mitchell et al., 2013, 
2020, Santer et al., 2017a, 2017b; Suárez-Gutiérrez et al., 2017; McKitrick and Christy, 2018), and that 
overestimated surface warming is partially responsible (Mitchell et al., 2013; Po-Chedley et al., 2021). Some 
studies point to forcing errors in the CMIP5 simulations in the early 21st century as a possible contributor 
(Mitchell et al., 2013; Sherwood and Nishant, 2015; Santer et al., 2017a), but CMIP6 simulations use 
updated forcing estimates yet generally still warm more than observations. Although accounting for internal 
variability and residual observational errors can reconcile models with observations to some extent (Suárez-
Gutiérrez et al., 2017; Mitchell et al., 2020), some studies suggest that climate sensitivity also plays a role 
(Mauritsen and Stevens, 2015; McKitrick and Christy, 2020; Po-Chedley et al., 2021). Hence, we assess with 
medium confidence that CMIP5 and CMIP6 models continue to overestimate observed warming in the upper 
tropical troposphere over the 1979-2014 period by at least 0.1°C per decade, in part because of an 
overestimate of the tropical SST trend pattern over this period. 
 
<figref>3.10</figref> 
 
The AR5 assessed as likely that anthropogenic forcings, dominated by greenhouse gases, contributed to the 
warming of the troposphere since 1961 (Bindoff et al., 2013). Since then, there has been further progress in 
detecting and attributing tropospheric temperature changes. Mitchell et al. (2020) used CMIP6 models to 
find that the main driver of tropospheric temperature changes are greenhouse gases. Previous detection of the 
anthropogenic influence on tropospheric warming may have overestimated uncertainties: Pallotta and Santer 
(2020) found that CMIP5 climate models overestimate the observed natural variability in global mean 
tropospheric temperature on timescales of 5-20 years. Nevertheless, Santer et al. (2019) found that stochastic 
uncertainty is greater for tropospheric warming (8-15 years) than stratospheric cooling (1-3 years) because of 
larger noise and slower recovery time from the Pinatubo eruption in the troposphere. The detection time of 
the anthropogenic signal in the tropospheric warming can be affected by both the model climate sensitivity 
and the model response to aerosol forcing. Volcanic forcing is also important, as models that do not consider 
the influence of volcanic eruptions in the early 21st century overestimate the observed tropospheric warming 
since 1998 (Santer et al., 2014). Changes in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of tropospheric temperatures 
have also been attributed to human influences. Santer et al. (2018) found that satellite data and climate 
models driven by anthropogenic forcing show consistent amplitude increases at mid-latitudes in both 
hemispheres, amplitude decreases at high latitudes in the SH, and small changes in the tropics. 
  
In summary, these studies confirm the dominant role of human activities in tropospheric temperature trends. 
We therefore assess that it is very likely that anthropogenic forcing, dominated by greenhouse gases, was the 
main driver of the warming of the troposphere since 1979.  
 
#### Stratospheric temperature 
The AR5 concluded that the CMIP5 models simulated a generally realistic evolution of lower stratospheric 
temperatures (Bindoff et al., 2013; Flato et al., 2013), which was better than the CMIP3 models, in part 
because they generally include time-varying ozone concentrations, unlike many of the CMIP3 models. 
Nonetheless, it was noted that there was a tendency for the simulations to underestimate stratospheric 
cooling compared to observations. Bindoff et al. (2013) concluded that it was very likely that anthropogenic 
forcing, dominated by stratospheric ozone depletion by chemical reactions involving trace species known as 
ozone-depleting substances (ODS), had contributed to the cooling of the lower stratosphere since 1979. 
Increased greenhouse gases cause near-surface warming but cooling of stratospheric temperatures.  
 
For the lower stratosphere, a debate has been ongoing since the AR5 between studies finding that models 
underestimate the cooling of stratospheric temperature (Santer et al., 2017b), in part because of 
underestimated stratospheric ozone depletion (Eyring et al., 2013; Young et al., 2013), and studies finding 
that lower stratospheric temperature trends are within the range of observed trends (Young et al., 2013; 
Maycock et al., 2018). Different observational data and different time periods explain the different 
conclusions. Aquila et al. (2016) used forced chemistry-climate models with prescribed SST to investigate 
the influence of different forcings on global stratospheric temperature changes. They found that in the lower 
stratosphere, the simulated cooling trend due to increasing greenhouse gases was roughly constant over the 
satellite era, while changes in ODS concentrations amplified that stratospheric cooling trend during the era of 
increasing ozone depletion up until the mid-1990s, with a flattening of the temperature trend over the 
subsequent period over which stratospheric ozone has stabilised (Section 2.2.5.2). Mitchell et al. (2020) 
showed that while models simulate realistic trends in tropical lower stratospheric temperature over the whole 
1979-2014 period when compared with radiosonde data, they tend to overestimate the cooling trend over the 
ozone depletion era (1979-1997) and underestimate it over the ozone recovery era (1998-2014) (Figure 3.10b 
and 3.10c). They speculate that those disagreements are due to poor representations of stratospheric ozone 
forcing.  
 
Upper stratospheric temperature changes were not assessed in the context of attribution or model evaluation 
in AR5, but this is an area where there has been considerable progress over recent years (see Section 
2.3.1.2.1). Simulated temperature changes in chemistry-climate models show good consistency with the 
reprocessed dataset from NOAA STAR but are less consistent with the revised UK Met Office record 
(Karpechko et al., 2018b). The latter still shows stronger cooling than simulated in chemistry-climate models 
(Maycock et al., 2018). Reanalyses, which assimilate AMSU and SSU datasets, indicate an upper-
stratospheric cooling from 1979 to 2009 of about 3°C at 5 hPa and 4°C at 1 hPa that agrees well with the 
cooling in simulations with prescribed SST and using CMIP5 forcings (Simmons et al., 2014). Mitchell 
(2016) used regularized optimal fingerprinting techniques to carry out an attribution analysis of annual mid 
to upper stratospheric temperature in response to external forcings. They found that anthropogenic forcing 
has caused a cooling of approximately 2-3°C in the upper stratosphere over the period of 1979-2015, with 
greenhouse gases contributing two thirds of this change and ozone depletion contributing one third. They 
find a large upper stratospheric temperature change in response to volcanic forcing (0.4-0.6 °C for Mount 
Pinatubo) but that change is still smaller than the lower-stratospheric signal. Aquila et al. (2016) found that 
the cooling of the middle and upper stratosphere after 1979 is mainly due to changes in greenhouse gas 
concentrations. Volcanic eruptions and the solar cycle were not found to affect long-term stratospheric 
temperature trends but to have short-term influences. 
 
In summary, based on the latest updates to satellite observations of stratospheric temperature, we assess that 
simulated and observed trends in global mean temperature through the depth of the stratosphere are more 
consistent than based on previous datasets, but some differences remain (medium confidence). Studies 
published since the AR5 increase our confidence in the simulated stratospheric temperature response to 
greenhouse gas and ozone changes, and support an assessment that it is extremely likely that stratospheric 
ozone depletion due to ozone-depleting substances was the main driver of the cooling of the lower 
stratosphere between 1979 and the mid-1990s, as expected from physical understanding. Similarly, revised 
observations and new studies support an assessment that it is extremely likely that anthropogenic forcing, 
both from increases in greenhouse gas concentration and depletion of stratospheric ozone due to ozone-
depleting substances, was the main driver of upper stratospheric cooling since 1979.

## 3.3.2  Precipitation, Humidity and Streamflow 
 
### Paleoclimate context 
A fact hindering detection and attribution studies in precipitation and other hydrological variables is the large 
internal variability of these fields relative to the anthropogenic signal. This low signal-to-noise ratio hinders 
the emergence of the anthropogenic signal from natural variability. Moreover, the sign of the change 
depends on location and time of the year. Paleoclimate records provide valuable context for observed trends 
in the 20th and 21st century and assist with the attribution of these trends to human influence (see also Section 
2.3.1.3.1). By nature, hydrological proxy data represent regional conditions, but taken together can represent 
large-scale patterns. As an example of how paleorecords have helped assessing the origin of changes, we 
consider some, mainly subtropical, regions which have experienced systematic drying in recent decades (see 
also Section 8.3.1.3). Paleoclimate simulations of monsoons are assessed in Section 3.3.3.2. 
 
Records of tree ring width have provided evidence that recent prolonged dry spells in the Levant and Chile 
are unprecedented in the last millennium (high confidence) (Cook et al., 2016a; Garreaud et al., 2017). East 
Africa, has also been drying in recent decades (Rowell et al., 2015; Hoell et al., 2017a), a trend that is 
unusual in the context of the sedimentary paleorecord spanning the last millennium (Tierney et al., 2015). 
This may be a signature of anthropogenic forcing but cannot as of yet be distinguished from natural 
variability (Hoell et al., 2017b; Philip et al., 2018). Likewise, tree rings indicate that the 2012-2014 drought 
in the southwestern United States was exceptionally severe in the context of natural variability in the last 
millennium, and may have been exacerbated by the contribution of anthropogenic temperature rise (medium 
confidence) (Griffin and Anchukaitis, 2014; Williams et al., 2015). Furthermore, Williams et al. (2020) used 
a combination of hydrological modelling and tree-ring reconstructions to show that the period from 2000 to 
2018 was the driest 19-year span in southwestern North America since the late 1500s. Nonetheless, tree rings 
also indicate the presence of prolonged megadroughts in western North America throughout the last 
millennium that were more severe than 20th and 21st century events (high confidence) (Cook et al., 2004, 
2010, 2015). These were associated with internal variability (Coats et al., 2016; Cook et al., 2016b) and 
indicate that large-magnitude changes in the water cycle may occur irrespective of anthropogenic influence 
(see also McKitrick and Christy, 2019). 
 
Paleoclimate records also allow for model evaluation under conditions different from present-day. AR5 
concluded that models can successfully reproduce to first-order patterns of past precipitation changes during 
the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and mid-Holocene, though simulated precipitation changes during the 
mid-Holocene tended to be underestimated (Flato et al., 2013). Further analysis of CMIP5 models confirmed 
these results but has also revealed systematic offsets from the paleoclimate record (DiNezio and Tierney, 
2013a; Hargreaves and Annan, 2014; Harrison et al., 2014, 2015; Bartlein et al., 2017; Scheff et al., 2017; 
Tierney et al., 2017a). Harrison et al. (2014) concluded that CMIP5 models do not perform better in 
simulating rainfall during the LGM and mid-Holocene than earlier model versions despite higher resolution 
and complexity. However, prescribing changes in vegetation and dust was found to improve the match to the 
paleoclimate record (Pausata et al., 2016; Tierney et al., 2017b) suggesting that vegetation feedbacks in the 
CMIP5 models may be too weak (low confidence) (Hopcroft et al., 2017). Brierley et al. (2020) compared 
the latitudinal gradient of annual precipitation changes in the European-African sector simulated by CMIP6 
models for the mid-Holocene with pollen-based reconstructions and showed that models generally reproduce 
the direction of changes seen in the reconstructions (Figure 3.11). They do not show a robust signal in area 
averaged rainfall over most European regions where quantitative reconstructions exist, which is not 
incompatible with reconstructions. Over the Sahara/Sahel and West Africa regions, where reconstructions 
suggest positive anomalies during the mid-Holocene, both CMIP5 and CMIP6 models also simulate a 
rainfall increase, but it is much weaker (see also Section 3.3.3.2). Overall, however, large discrepancies 
remain between simulations and reconstructions.  
 
Liu et al. (2018) evaluated the terrestrial moisture changes that occurred during the LGM and concluded that 
the multi-model median from CMIP5 is consistent with available paleo-records in some regions, but not in 
others. CMIP5 models accurately reproduce an increase in moisture in the western United States, related to 
an intensified winter storm track and decreased evaporative demand (Oster et al., 2015; Ibarra et al., 2018; 
Lora, 2018). On the other hand, CMIP5 models show a wide variety of responses in the tropical Indo-Pacific 
region, with only a few matching the pattern of change inferred from the paleoclimate record (DiNezio and 
Tierney, 2013b; DiNezio et al., 2018). The variable response across models is related to the effect of the 
exposure of the tropical shelves during glacial times, which variously intensifies or weakens convection in 
the rising branch of the Walker cell, depending on model parameterization (DiNezio et al., 2011). For the 
Last Interglacial, CMIP6 models reproduce the proxy-based increased precipitation relative to pre-industrial 
in the North African, South Asian and North American regions, but not in Australia (Scussolini et al., 2019).  
 
In  summary,  there  is  medium  confidence  that CMIP5  and  CMIP6  models  can  reproduce  broad  aspects  of 
precipitation changes during paleo reference periods, but large discrepancies remain. Further assessment of 
model performance and comparison between CMIP5 and CMIP6 during past climates can be found in Section 
3.8.2.1.

### 3.3.2.1  Atmospheric Water Vapour 
 
The AR5 concluded that an anthropogenic contribution to increases in specific humidity is found with 
medium confidence at and near the surface. A levelling off of atmospheric water vapour over land in the last 
two decades that needed better understanding, and remaining observational uncertainties, precluded a more 
confident assessment (Bindoff et al., 2013). Sections 4.5.1.3 and 8.3.1.4 show that there have been 
significant advances in the understanding of the processes controlling land surface humidity. In particular, 
there has been a focus on the role of oceanic moisture transport and land-atmosphere feedbacks in explaining 
the observed trends in relative humidity. 
 
Water vapour is the most important natural greenhouse gas and its amount is expected to increase in a global 
warming context leading to further warming. Particularly important are changes in the upper troposphere 
because there water vapour regulates the strength of the water-vapour feedback (Section 7.4.2.2). CMIP5 
models have been shown to have a wet bias in the tropical upper troposphere and a dry bias in the lower 
troposphere, with the former bias and model spread being larger than the latter (Jiang et al., 2012; Tian et al., 
2013). Tian et al. (2013) also showed that in comparison to the AIRS specific humidity, CMIP5 models have 
the well-known double intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) bias in the troposphere from 1000 hPa to 300 
hPa, especially in the tropical Pacific. Water vapour biases in models are dominated by errors in relative 
humidity throughout the troposphere, which are in turn closely related to errors in large scale circulation; 
temperature errors dominate near the tropopause (Takahashi et al., 2016). Section 7.4.2 discusses this topic 
in more detail for CMIP6 models. However, Schroeder et al. (2019) show that the majority of well-
established water vapour records are affected by inhomogeneity issues and thus should be used with caution 
(see also Section 2.3.1.3.3). A comparison of trends in column water vapour path for 1998-2019 in satellite 
data, a reanalysis, CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulations averaged over the near-global ocean reveals that while on 
average model trends are higher than those in observations and reanalysis, the latter lie within the multi-
model range (Figure 3.12). 
 
<figref>3.12</figref> 
 
The detection and attribution of tropospheric water vapour changes can be traced back to Santer et al. (2007), 
who used estimates of the atmospheric water vapour from satellite-based Special Sensor Microwave Imager 
(SSM/I) and from CMIP3 historical climate simulations. They provide evidence of human-induced 
moistening of the troposphere, and the simulated human fingerprint pattern was detectable at the 5% level by 
2002 in water vapour satellite data (from 1988 to 2006). The observed changes matched the historical 
simulations forced by greenhouse gas changes and other anthropogenic forcings, and not those due to natural 
variability alone. Then, Santer et al. (2009) repeated this study with CMIP5 models, and found that the 
detection and attribution conclusions were not sensitive to model quality. These results demonstrate that the 
human fingerprint is governed by robust and basic physical processes, such as the water vapour feedback. 
Finally, Chung et al. (2014) extended this line of research by focusing on the global-mean water vapour 
content in the upper troposphere. Using satellite-based observations and sets of CMIP5 climate simulations 
run under various climate-forcing options, they showed that the observed moistening trend of the upper 
troposphere over the 1979-2005 period could not be explained by internal variability alone, but is attributable 
to a combination of anthropogenic and natural forcings. This increase in water vapour is accompanied by a 
reduction in mid-tropospheric relative humidity and clouds in the subtropics and mid-latitude in both models 
and observations related to changes in the Hadley cell (Lau and Kim, 2015; also Section 3.3.3.1).  
 
Dunn et al. (2017) confirmed earlier findings that global mean surface relative humidity increased during 
1973-2000, followed by a steep decline (also reported in Willet et al., 2014) until 2013, and specific 
humidity correspondingly increased and then remained approximately constant (see also Section 2.3.1.3.2), 
with none of the CMIP5 models capturing this behaviour. They noted biases in the mean state of the CMIP5 
models’ surface relative humidity (and ascribe the failure to the representation of land surface processes and 
their response to CO2 forcing), concluding that these biases preclude any detection and attribution 
assessment. On the other hand, Byrne and O’Gorman (2018) show that the positive trend in specific 
humidity continued in recent years and can be detected over land and ocean from 1979 to 2016. Moreover, 
they provide a theory suggesting that the increase in annual surface temperature and specific humidity as 
well as the decrease in relative humidity observed over land are linked to warming over the neighbouring 
ocean. They also point out that the negative trend in relative humidity over land regions is quite uncertain 
and requires further investigation. A recent study has also identified an anthropogenically-driven decrease in 
relative humidity over the NH midlatitude continents in summer during 1979-2014, which was 
underestimated by CMIP5 models (Douville and Plazzotta, 2017). Furthermore, in a modelling study 
Douville et al. (2020) showed that this decrease in boreal summer relative humidity over midlatitudes is 
related not only to global ocean warming, but also to the physiological effect of CO2 on plants in the land 
surface model. 
 
In summary, we assess that it is likely that human influence has contributed to moistening in the upper 
troposphere since 1979. Also, there is medium confidence that human influence contributed to a global 
increase in annual surface specific humidity, and medium confidence that it contributed to a decrease in 
surface relative humidity over midlatitude NH continents during summertime.  
 
 
### 3.3.2.2  Precipitation 
 
AR5 concluded that there was medium confidence that human influence had contributed to large-scale 
precipitation changes over land since 1950, including an increase in the NH mid to high latitudes. Moreover, 
AR5 concluded that observational uncertainties and challenges in precipitation modelling precluded a more 
confident assessment (Bindoff et al., 2013). Overall, they found that large-scale features of mean 
precipitation in CMIP5 models are in modest agreement with observations, but there are systematic errors in 
the tropics (Flato et al., 2013). 
 
Since AR5, Li et al. (2016b) found that CMIP5 models simulate the large scale patterns of annual mean land 
precipitation and seasonality well, as well as reproducing qualitatively the observed zonal mean land 
precipitation trends for the period 1948-2005: models capture the drying trends in the tropics and at 45°S and 
the wetting trend in the NH mid-to-high latitudes, but the amplitudes of the changes are much smaller than 
observed. Land precipitation was found to show enhanced seasonality in observations (Chou et al., 2013), 
qualitatively consistent with the simulated response to anthropogenic forcing (Dwyer et al., 2014). However, 
models do not appear to reproduce the zonal mean trends of seasonality over the period 1948-2005, nor the 
two-dimensional distributions of trends of annual precipitation and seasonality over land, but differences 
may be explainable by internal variability (Li et al., 2016b). However, observed trends in seasonality depend 
on data set used (Li et al., 2016b; Marvel et al., 2017), and Marvel et al. (2017) found that observed changes 
in the annual cycle phase are consistent with model estimates of forced changes. These phase changes are 
mainly characterized by earlier onset of the wet season on the equatorward flanks of the extratropical storm 
tracks, particularly in the SH. Box 8.2 assesses regional changes in water cycle seasonality. 
 
The CMIP5 models have also been shown to adequately simulate the mean and interannual variability of the 
global monsoon (Section 3.3.3.2), but maintain the double ITCZ bias in the equatorial Pacific (Lee and 
Wang, 2014a; Tian, 2015; Ni and Hsu, 2018). Despite the ITCZ bias, CMIP5 models have been used to 
detect in reanalysis a southward shift in the ITCZ prior to 1975, followed by a northward shift in the ITCZ 
after 1975, in response to forced changes in inter-hemispheric temperature contrast (Bonfils et al., 2020; 
Friedman et al., 2020) (Sections 3.3.1.1 and 8.3.2.1, Figure 8.11). CMIP5 models perform better than CMIP3 
models, in particular regarding the global monsoon domain and intensity (Lee and Wang, 2014b). 
 
In observations at time scales less than a day intermittent rainfall fluctuations dominate variability, but 
CMIP5 models systematically underestimate them (Covey et al., 2018). Moreover, as noted in previous 
generation models, CMIP5 models produce rainfall too early in the day (Covey et al., 2016). Also, models 
overpredict precipitation frequency but have weaker intensity, although comparison with observed data sets 
is complex as the latter present large differences in intensity among them (Herold et al., 2016; Pendergrass 
and Deser, 2017; Trenberth et al., 2017). Regarding trends in precipitation intensity, models have also been 
shown to reproduce the compensation between increasing heavy precipitation and decreasing light to 
moderate rainfall (Thackeray et al., 2018), a characteristic found in the observational record (Gu and Adler, 
2018). Regional performance is further assessed in Chapters 8 and the Atlas, while precipitation extremes are 
considered in Chapter 11. 
 
The simulation of annual mean rainfall patterns in the CMIP6 models reveals minor improvements compared 
to those of CMIP5 models (Figure 3.13). The persistent biases include the double ITCZ in the tropical 
Pacific (seen as bands of excessive rainfall at both sides of the equatorial Pacific in Figure 3.13b,d) and the 
southward-shifted ITCZ in the equatorial Atlantic, which have been linked to the meridional pattern of SST 
bias (Zhou et al., 2020a) and the reduced sensitivity of precipitation to local SST (Good et al., 2021). Tian 
and Dong (2020) also found that all three generations of CMIP models share similar systematic annual mean 
precipitation errors in the tropics, but that the double ITCZ bias is slightly reduced in CMIP6 models in 
comparison to CMIP3 and CMIP5 models. They also found some improvement in the overly intense Indian 
ocean ITCZ and the too dry South American continent except over the Andes. Fiedler et al. (2020) identified 
improvements in the tropical mean spatial correlations and root mean square error of the climatology as well 
as in the day-to-day variability, but found little change across CMIP phases in the double ITCZ bias and 
diurnal cycle. The CMIP6 models reproduce better the domain and intensity of the global monsoon (see 
Section 3.3.3.2). Moreover, CMIP6 models better represent the storm tracks (Priestley et al., 2020; also 
Section 3.3.3.3), thereby reducing the precipitation biases in the North Atlantic and midlatitudes of the SH 
(Figure 3.13b,d). As a result, pattern correlations between simulated and observed annual mean precipitation 
range between 0.80 and 0.92 for CMIP6, compared to a range of 0.79 to 0.88 for CMIP5 (Bock et al., 2020). 
This relative improvement may be related to increased model resolution, as found when comparing biases in 
the mean of the HighResMIP models with the mean of the corresponding lower-resolution versions of the 
same models (see Figure 3.13e,f), particularly in the tropics and extratropical storm tracks. In agreement, a 
recent study using several coupled models showed that increasing the atmospheric resolution leads to a 
strong decrease in the precipitation bias in the tropical Atlantic ITCZ (Vannière et al., 2019) (see further 
discussion in Section 3.8.2.2). Based on these results we assess that despite some improvements, CMIP6 
models still have deficiencies in simulating precipitation patterns, particularly over the tropical ocean (high 
confidence). 
 
<figref>3.13</figref> 
 
Recent studies comparing observations and CMIP5 simulations have shown that tropical volcanic eruptions 
induce a significant reduction in global precipitation, particularly over the wet tropics, including the global 
monsoon regions (Iles and Hegerl, 2014; Paik and Min, 2017; Paik et al., 2020a). Reconstructions and 
modelling studies also suggest a distinct remote influence of volcanic forcing such that large volcanoes 
erupting in one hemisphere can enhance global monsoon precipitation in the other hemisphere (Liu et al., 
2016a; Zuo et al., 2019). The climatic effect of volcanic eruptions is further assessed in Cross-Chapter Box 
4.1. 
 
An intensification of the wet-dry zonal mean patterns, consisting of the wet tropical and mid-latitude bands 
becoming wetter, and the dry subtopics becoming drier is expected in response to greenhouse gas and ozone 
changes (Section 8.2.2.1). However, detecting these changes is complicated by model errors in locating the 
main features of rainfall patterns. To deal with this issue, Marvel and Bonfils (2013) identified in each 
CMIP5 historical simulation the latitudinal peaks and troughs of the rainfall latitudinal patterns, measured 
the amplification and shift of these patterns in a pattern-based fingerprinting study, and found that the 
simultaneous amplification and shift in zonal precipitation patterns are detectable in Global Precipitation 
Climatology Project (GPCP) observations over the 1979-2012 period. Similarly, Bonfils et al. (2020) found 
that the intensification of wet-dry zonal patterns identified in CMIP5 historical simulations is detectable in 
reanalyses over the 1950-2014 period (see also Figure 8.11).  
 
Based on long-term island precipitation records, Polson et al. (2016) identified significant increases in 
precipitation in the tropics and decreases in the subtropics, which are consistent with those simulated by the 
CMIP5 models. Moreover, results from Polson and Hegerl (2017) give support to an intensification of the 
water cycle according to the wet-gets-wetter, dry-gets-drier paradigm over tropical land areas as well. Other 
studies suggest that this paradigm does not necessarily hold over dry regions where moisture is limited 
(Greve et al., 2014; Kumar et al., 2015, see also Section 8.2.2.1). Polson and Hegerl (2017) explained this 
discrepancy by taking into account the seasonal and interannual movement of the regions (Allan, 2014). A 
follow-up study using CMIP6 models also found that the observed strengthening contrast of precipitation 
over wet and dry regions was detectable, although the increase was significantly larger in observations than 
in the multi-model mean. The change was attributed to a combination of anthropogenic and natural forcings, 
with anthropogenic forcings detectable in multi-signal analyses (Figure 3.14; Schurer et al. (2020)).  
 
<figref>3.14</figref> 
 
Global land precipitation has likely increased since the middle of the 20th century (medium confidence), while 
there is low confidence in trends in land data prior to 1950 and over the ocean during the satellite era due to 
disagreement between datasets (Section 2.3.1.3.4). Figure 3.15a shows the time evolution of the global mean 
land precipitation since 1950, as well as the trend during the period. Adler et al. (2017) found no significant 
trend in the global mean precipitation during the satellite era, consistent with model simulations (Wu et al., 
2013) and physical understanding of the energy budget (Section 8.2.1). This has been suggested to be due to 
the negative effect of anthropogenic sulphates that opposed the positive influence of rising global mean 
temperatures due to greenhouse gases (Salzmann, 2016; Richardson et al., 2018). The precipitation change 
expected from ocean warming is also partly offset by the fast atmospheric adjustment to increasing 
greenhouse gases (Section 8.2.1). Over the ocean, the negligible trend may be due to the cancelling effects of 
CO2 and aerosols (Richardson et al., 2018). 
 
A gridpoint based analysis of annual precipitation trends over land regions since 1901 (Knutson and Zeng, 
2018) comparing observed and simulated trends found that detectable anthropogenic increasing trends have 
occurred prominently over many middle to high latitude regions of the NH and subtropics of the SH. The 
observed trends in many cases are significantly stronger than modelled in the CMIP5 historical runs for the 
1901-2010 period (though not for 1951-2010), which may be due to disagreement between observed data 
sets (Section 2.3.1.3.4), and/or suggest possible deficiencies in models. 
 
The observed precipitation increase in the NH high latitudes over the period 1966-2005 was attributed to 
anthropogenic forcing by a study using CMIP5 models (Wan et al., 2015) supporting the AR5 assessment. 
Initial results from CMIP6 also support the role of anthropogenic forcing in the precipitation increase 
observed in NH high latitudes (see Figure 3.15c): the observed positive trend detected for the band 60°N-
90°N can only be reproduced when anthropogenic forcing is included, although models tend to simulate 
overall a larger positive trend. A similar positive trend, but less significant, is also detected between 30°N-
60°N, while in the southern mid-latitudes no trend is simulated (see Figure 3.15d, f).  
 
<figref>3.15</figref> 
 
For the SH extratropics, Solman and Orlanski (2016) found that the observed summertime rainfall increase 
over high latitudes and decrease over mid-latitudes over the period 1979-2010 are quasi-zonally symmetric 
and related to changes in eddy activity. The latter were in turn found to be associated with the poleward shift 
of the westerlies due mostly to ozone depletion. Positive rainfall trends in the subtropics, particularly over 
southeastern South America (see also Section 10.4.2.2) and northern and central Australia, have been also 
attributed to stratospheric ozone depletion (Kang et al., 2011; Gonzalez et al., 2014) and greenhouse gases 
(Vera and Diaz, 2014; Saurral et al., 2019). During austral winter, wetting at high latitudes and drying at 
mid-latitudes are not zonally homogenous, due to both changes in eddy activity and increased lower 
troposphere humidity. Solman and Orlanski (2016) associated these climate changes with increases in 
greenhouse gas concentration levels. Recently, Blazquez and Solman (2017) have shown that CMIP5 models 
represent very well the dynamical forcing and the frequency of frontal precipitation in the SH winter 
extratropics, but the amount of precipitation due to fronts is overestimated. Chapters 10 and 11 validate in 
more detail the simulation of fronts in climate models (Sections 10.3.3.4.4 and 11.7.2.3). 
 
Over the ocean, observations show coherent large-scale patterns of fresh ocean regions becoming fresher and 
salty ocean regions saltier across the globe, which has been related through modelling studies to changes in 
precipitation minus evaporation and is consistent with the wet-gets-wetter, dry-gets-drier paradigm (see 
Sections 3.5.2.2 and 8.2.2.1, Durack et al., 2012, 2013; Skliris et al., 2014; Durack, 2015; Hegerl et al., 2015; 
Levang and Schmitt, 2015; Zika et al., 2015; Grist et al., 2016; Cheng et al., 2020). 
 
Overall, studies published since AR5 provide further evidence of an anthropogenic influence on 
precipitation, and therefore we now assess that it is likely that human influence has contributed to large-scale 
precipitation changes observed since the mid-20th century. New attribution studies strengthen previous 
findings of a detectable increase in mid to high latitude land precipitation over the NH (high confidence). 
There is medium confidence that human influence has contributed to a strengthening of the zonal mean wet 
tropics-dry subtropics contrast, and that tropical rainfall changes follow the wet-gets-wetter, dry-gets-drier 
paradigm. There is also medium confidence that ozone depletion has increased precipitation over the 
southern high latitudes and decreased it over southern midlatitudes during austral summer. Owing to 
observational uncertainties and inconsistent results between studies, we conclude that there is low confidence 
in the attribution of changes in the seasonality of precipitation.  
 
 
### 3.3.2.3  Streamflow 
 
Streamflow is to-date the only variable of the terrestrial water cycle with enough in-situ observations to 
allow for detection and attribution analysis at continental to global scales. Based on evidence from a few 
formal detection and attribution studies, particularly on the timing of peak streamflow, and the qualitative 
evaluation of studies reporting on observed and simulated trends, AR5 concluded that there is medium 
confidence that anthropogenic influence on climate has affected streamflow in some middle and high latitude 
regions. AR5 also noted that observational uncertainties are large and that often only a limited number of 
models were considered. 
 
Section 2.3.1.3.6 assesses that there have not been significant trends in global average streamflow over the 
last century, though regional trends have been observed, driven in part by internal variability. Only a limited 
number of studies have systematically compared observed streamflow trends at continental to global scales 
with changes simulated by global circulation models in a detection and attribution setting. Yang et al. (2017) 
did not find a significant correlation between observed runoff changes and changes simulated in CMIP5 
models in most grid cells, consistent with the assessment that observed changes are dominated by internal 
variability. In a pan-European assessment, Gudmundsson et al. (2017) attribute the spatio-temporal pattern of 
decreasing streamflow in southern Europe and increasing streamflow in northern Europe to anthropogenic 
climate change, but also concluded that additional effects of human water withdrawals could not be 
excluded. Focussing on continental runoff during 1958-2004, Alkama et al. (2013) found a significant 
change only when using reconstructed data over all rivers, and a large uncertainty in the estimate of the 
global streamflow trend due to opposing changes over different continents. Gedney et al. (2014) detected the 
influence of aerosols on streamflow in North America and Europe, with aerosols having driven an increase 
in streamflow due to reduced evaporation (see Section 8.3.1.5 for details on processes). There is also 
evidence for a detectable anthropogenic contribution toward earlier winter-spring streamflows in the north-
central US (Kam et al., 2018) and in western Canada (Najafi et al., 2017). From a model evaluation 
perspective, Sheffield et al. (2013) reported that CMIP5 models reproduce spatial variations in runoff in 
North America well, though they tend to underestimate it. 
 
Recently, Gudmundsson et al. (2021) performed a global detection and attribution study on streamflow and 
found that some regions are drying and others are wetting. Moreover, the simulated streamflow trends are 
consistent with observations only if externally forced climate change is considered, and the simulated effects 
of water and land management cannot reproduce the observed trends. The effects of volcanic eruptions in 
driving reduced streamflow have also been detected in the wet tropics (Iles and Hegerl, 2015; Zuo et al., 
2019).  
 
In summary, there is medium confidence that anthropogenic climate change has altered local and regional 
streamflow in various parts of the world and that the associated global-scale trend pattern is inconsistent with 
internal variability. Moreover, human interventions and water withdrawals, while affecting streamflow, 
cannot explain the observed spatio-temporal trends (medium confidence).

## 3.3.3  Atmospheric Circulation 
 
### 3.3.3.1  The Hadley and Walker Circulations 
 
The tropical tropospheric circulation features meridional and zonal overturning circulations, called Hadley 
and Walker circulations. In the zonal mean, the downwelling branch of the Hadley circulation cell is located 
in the subtropics and is often used as an indicator of the meridional extent of the tropics. In the equatorial 
zonal-vertical section, the major rising branch of the Walker circulation is located over the Maritime 
continent with secondary ascending regions over northern South America and Africa. The zonal component 
of the surface trade winds over most of the equatorial Pacific and Atlantic is associated with the Walker 
circulation. The present section assesses the zonal-mean Hadley cell extent and the Pacific Walker 
circulation strength. Regional and water cycle aspects of these circulations are assessed in more detail in 
Section 8.3.2. 
 
AR5 found medium confidence that the depletion of stratospheric ozone had contributed to Hadley cell 
widening in the SH in austral summer (Bindoff et al., 2013). It also noted that in contrast to a simulated 
weakening in response to greenhouse gas forcing, the Walker circulation had actually strengthened since the 
early 1990s, precluding any detection of human influence. 
 
#### Hadley cell extent 
Grise et al. (2019) found that a metric based on surface zonal winds, which are well constrained by surface 
observations, best compares reanalyses with CMIP5 models. With this method and new reanalysis products, 
the CMIP5 historical simulation ensembles simulate comparable mean states and variability of the 
subtropical edge latitude of the Hadley cells to those observed (Grise et al., 2019).  
 
Chapter 2 assesses that there has been a very likely widening of the Hadley circulation since the 1980s 
(Section 2.3.1.4.1). The CMIP5 (Davis and Birner, 2017; Grise et al., 2018) and CMIP6 (Grise and Davis, 
2020) historical simulation ensembles span the observed trend of the zonal-mean Hadley cell edges since the 
1980s (Figure 3.16a-c). Studies based on CMIP5 models find a contribution from human influence to the 
observed widening trend, especially in the SH (Gerber and Son, 2014a; Staten et al., 2018, 2020; Grise et al., 
2019; Jebri et al., 2020), which is confirmed in CMIP6 (Figure 3.16b-c; Grise and Davis, 2020).  
 
In the annual mean, internal variability, including Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV; Annex IV.2.6), 
contributed to the observed zonal-mean Hadley cell expansion since 1980 comparably with human influence 
(Allen et al., 2014; Allen and Kovilakam, 2017; Mantsis et al., 2017; Amaya et al., 2018; Grise et al., 2018). 
Indeed, the ensemble-mean expansion in historical simulations is significantly weaker than in most of the 
reanalyses shown in Figure 3.16a-c, while the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) 
simulations forced by observed SSTs (Figure 3.16a-c) show stronger trends than historical coupled 
simulations on average (Davis and Birner, 2017; Grise et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2015). The human-induced 
change has not yet clearly emerged out of the internal variability range in the NH expansion (Quan et al., 
2018; Grise et al., 2019), whereas the trend in the annual-mean SH edge is outside the 5-95th percentile range 
of internal variability in CMIP6 in 3 out of the 4 reanalyses (Figure 3.16b). For the SH summer when the 
simulated human influence is strongest, the 1981-2000 trend in 3 out of the 4 reanalyses falls outside the 5-
95th percentile range of internal variability (Grise et al., 2018, 2019; Tao et al., 2016).  
 
In CMIP5 simulations, greenhouse gas increases and, in austral summer, stratospheric ozone depletion, 
contribute to the SH expansion (Gerber and Son, 2014b; Nguyen et al., 2015; Tao et al., 2016a; Kim et al., 
2017b), but the ozone influence is not significant in available CMIP6 simulations (Figure 3.16b-c). Since the 
2000s, the stabilization or slight recovery of stratospheric ozone (Section 2.2.5.2) is consistent with the 
smaller observed trends (Banerjee et al., 2020). While many CMIP5 models underrepresent the magnitude of 
the PDV, implying potential overconfidence on the detection of human influence on the Hadley cell 
expansion, this is less the case for the CMIP6 models (Section 3.7.6). However, the mechanism underlying 
the Hadley Cell expansion remains unclear (Staten et al., 2018, 2020), precluding a process-based validation 
of the simulated human influence. 
 
#### Walker circulation strength 
CMIP5 models reproduce the mean state of the Walker circulation with reasonable fidelity, evidenced by the 
spatial pattern correlations of equatorial zonal mass stream function between models and observations being 
larger than 0.88 (Ma and Zhou, 2016a). CMIP5 historical simulations on average simulate a significant 
weakening of the Pacific Walker circulation over the 20th century (DiNezio et al., 2013; Sandeep et al., 2014; 
Kociuba and Power, 2015), which is also seen in CMIP6 (Figure 3.16d). This weakening is accompanied by 
reduction of convective activity over the Maritime Continent and enhancement over the central equatorial 
Pacific (DiNezio et al., 2013; Sandeep et al., 2014; Kociuba and Power, 2015). In the CMIP6 simulations, 
greenhouse gas forcing induces this weakening (Figure 3.16d), which is consistent with theories based on 
radiative-convective equilibrium (Vecchi et al., 2006; Vecchi and Soden, 2007) and thermodynamic air-sea 
coupling (Xie et al., 2010), but inconsistent with a theory highlighting the ocean dynamical effect which 
suggests a strengthening in response to greenhouse gas increases (Clement et al., 1996; Seager et al., 2019; 
see also Section 7.4.4.2.1). Seager et al. (2019) attributed this inconsistency to equatorial Pacific SST biases 
in the models (Section 3.5.1.2). However, observational and reanalysis data sets disagree on the sign of 
trends in the Walker Circulation strength over the 1901-2010 period (Figure 3.16d,), and Section 2.3.1.4.1 
assesses low confidence in observed long-term Walker Circulation trends. The observational uncertainty 
remains high in the trends since the 1950s (Tokinaga et al., 2012; L’Heureux et al., 2013), though both 
CMIP5 and CMIP6 historical simulations span trends of all but one observational data set (Figure 3.16e). For 
this period, external influence simulated in CMIP6 is insignificant due to a partial compensation of forced 
responses to greenhouse gases and aerosols and large internal decadal variability (Figure 3.16e). It is notable 
that while AMIP simulations on average show strengthening over both the periods, those simulations are 
forced by one reconstruction of SST, which itself is subject to uncertainty before the 1970s (Deser et al., 
2010; Tokinaga et al., 2012). 
 
Observational SST products indicate that the equatorial zonal SST gradient from the western to the eastern 
equatorial Pacific has strengthened since 1870 (Section 7.4.4.2.1). While CMIP5 historical simulations on 
average simulate a weakening, large ensemble simulations span the observed strengthening since the 1950s 
(Watanabe et al., 2021) suggesting an important contribution from internal variability. Coats and Karnauskas 
(2017) also find that the anthropogenic influence on the SST gradient is yet to emerge out of internal 
variability even on centennial timescales. 
 
Trends since the 1980s in in-situ and satellite observations and reanalyses exhibit strengthening of the 
Pacific Walker circulation and SST gradient (L’Heureux et al., 2013; Boisséson et al., 2014; England et al., 
2014; Kociuba and Power, 2015; Ma and Zhou, 2016; Section 2.3.1.4.1; Figure 3.16f). AMIP simulations 
reproduce this strengthening (Boisséson et al., 2014; Ma and Zhou, 2016; Figure 3.16d), indicating a 
dominant role of SST changes. However, all reanalysis trends lie outside the 5-95% range of simulated 
CMIP6 historical Walker circulation trends over this period (Figure 3.16f), consistent with CMIP5 results 
(England et al., 2014; Kociuba and Power, 2015). This may be in part caused by the underestimation of the 
PDV magnitude especially in CMIP5 models (Kociuba and Power, 2015; Chung et al., 2019; Section 3.7.6), 
but also suggests a potential error in simulating the forced changes of the Walker circulation. Specifically, 
anthropogenic and volcanic aerosol changes over this period may have driven a strengthening (DiNezio et 
al., 2013; Takahashi and Watanabe, 2016a; Hua et al., 2018). This aerosol influence may be indirect via 
Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV; Annex IV.2.7) through inter-basin teleconnections (McGregor et 
al., 2014; Li et al., 2015d; Chikamoto et al., 2016; Kucharski et al., 2016; Ruprich-Robert et al., 2017), 
which may be underestimated in models due to SST biases in the equatorial Atlantic (Section 3.5.1.2; 
McGregor et al., 2018). Note also the large uncertainty in aerosol influence on the Walker circulation (Kuntz 
and Schrag, 2016; Hua et al., 2018; Oudar et al., 2018), which is also seen in CMIP6 (Figure 3.16f). 
 
Paleoclimate data from the Pliocene epoch suggest that there was a reduction in the zonal SST gradient in the 
tropical Pacific under a similar CO2 concentration as today (Cross-Chapter Box 2.4; Section 7.4.4.2.2). 
Tierney et al. (2019) found that this weaker gradient compared to pre-industrial, which suggests a weaker 
Walker circulation, is captured by climate models under Pliocene CO2 levels, in agreement with the CMIP6 
response to greenhouse gas forcing (Figure 3.16d), though the magnitude of this effect varies strongly 
between models (Corvec and Fletcher, 2017).  
 
#### Summary 
It is likely that human influence has contributed to the poleward expansion of the zonal mean Hadley cell in 
the SH since the 1980s. This assessment is supported by studies since AR5, which consistently find human 
influence from greenhouse gas increases on the expansion, with additional influence from ozone depletion in 
austral summer. For the strong ozone depletion period of 1981-2000, human influence is detectable in the 
summertime poleward expansion in the SH (medium confidence). By contrast, there is medium confidence 
that the expansion of the zonal mean Hadley cell in the NH is within the range of internal variability, with 
contributions from PDV and other internal variability. The causes of the observed strengthening of the 
Pacific Walker circulation over the 1980-2014 period are not well understood, since the observed 
strengthening trend is outside the range of variability simulated in the coupled models (medium confidence). 
Large observational uncertainty, lack of understanding of the mechanism underlying the poleward Hadley 
cell expansion, and contradicting theories on the greenhouse gas influence and uncertainty in the aerosol 
influence on the Walker circulation strength, limit confidence in these assessments.

### 3.3.3.2  Global Monsoon 
 
Monsoons are seasonal transitions of regimes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation with the annual 
cycle of solar insolation, in association with redistribution of moist static energy (Wang and Ding, 2008; 
Wang et al., 2014b; Biasutti et al., 2018). The global monsoon can be defined to encompasses all monsoon 
systems based on precipitation contrast in the solstice seasons (Wang and Ding, 2008; Figure 3.17). All 
regional monsoons are intimately connected to the global tropical atmospheric overturning by mass 
(Trenberth et al., 2000), momentum and energy budgets (Biasutti et al., 2018; Geen et al., 2020). 
Assessments of regional monsoon changes are made in Section 8.3.2.4 and Sections 10.4.2.1 and 10.6.3. 
 
AR5 assessed that CMIP5 models simulated monsoons better than CMIP3 models but that biases remained 
in domains and intensity (high confidence) (Flato et al., 2013). There were no detection and attribution 
assessment statements on the decreasing trend of global monsoon precipitation over land from the 1950s to 
the 1980s or the increasing trend of global monsoon precipitation afterwards. In the paleoclimate context, it 
was determined with high confidence that orbital forcing produces strong interhemispheric rainfall variability 
evident in multiple types of proxies (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013a). 
 
Paleoclimate proxy evidence shows that the global monsoon has varied with orbital forcing and greenhouse 
gases (Section 2.3.1.4.2; Mohtadi et al., 2016; Seth et al., 2019). These large-magnitude intensifications and 
weakenings in the global monsoon involved in some cases orders-of-magnitude changes in precipitation 
locally (Harrison et al., 2014; Tierney et al., 2017c). Paleoclimate modelling and limited data from past 
climate states with high CO2 suggest that precipitation intensifies in the monsoon domain under elevated 
greenhouse gases, providing context for present and future trends (Passey et al., 2009; Haywood et al., 2013; 
Zhang et al., 2013b). In model simulations of the mid-Pliocene, when globally averaged temperature was 
higher than present day, precipitation was larger in West African and South and East Asian monsoons than 
under pre-industrial conditions, consistent with proxy evidence (Zhang et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2016, 2018; 
Corvec and Fletcher, 2017; Li et al., 2018a). Prescott et al. (2019) and Zhang et al. (2019) find an important 
role for orbital forcing and CO2 in the mid-Pliocene monsoon expansion and intensification. Models are also 
able to capture interhemispherically contrasting monsoon changes in the Last Interglacial in response to 
orbital forcing and greenhouse gases, with wetter West African and Asian monsoons and a drier South 
American monsoon as seen in proxies (Govin et al., 2014; Gierz et al., 2017; Pedersen et al., 2017). In 
overall agreement with proxy evidence, a model with transient forcing simulates wetting and drying 
respectively of the Southern and NH monsoons during the last deglaciation, with an important contribution 
from Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) slowdown (Otto-Bliesner et al., 2014; Mohtadi 
et al., 2016).  
 
During the mid-Holocene, global monsoons were stronger especially in the NH with an expansion of the 
West African monsoon domain in response to orbital forcing (Biasutti et al., 2018; Section 2.3.1.4.2). 
Simulations of the mid-Holocene with CMIP5 and CMIP6 models qualitatively capture the stronger NH 
monsoon (Jiang et al., 2015; Brierley et al., 2020), mainly driven by atmospheric circulation changes 
(D’Agostino et al., 2019). However, the models underestimate the monsoon expansion found in proxy 
reconstructions (Perez-Sanz et al., 2014; Harrison et al., 2015; Tierney et al., 2017d), which may be linked to 
mean biases in the monsoon domain (Brierley et al., 2020) and may be improved by imposing vegetation and 
dust changes (Pausata et al., 2016). The models simulate the weaker SH monsoon during the mid-Holocene 
(D’Agostino et al., 2020), consistent with proxy evidence (Section 2.3.1.4.2). These studies indicate that 
models can qualitatively reproduce past global monsoon changes seen in proxies, though issues remain in 
quantitatively reproducing proxy observations. Studies of last millennium simulations show that simulated 
global monsoon precipitation increases with global mean temperature, while changes in monsoon circulation 
and hemispheric monsoon precipitation depend on forcing sources (Liu et al., 2012; Chai et al., 2018). 
Compared to greenhouse gas and solar variations, volcanic forcing is more effective in changing the global 
monsoon precipitation over the last millennium (Chai et al., 2018). 
 
Reproducing monsoons in terms of domain, precipitation amount, and timings of onset and retreat over the 
historical period also remains difficult. While CMIP5 historical simulations correctly capture global 
monsoon domains and intensity based on summer and winter precipitation differences, they underestimate 
the extent and intensity of East Asian and North American monsoons while overestimating them over the 
tropical western North Pacific (Lee and Wang, 2014b; Yan et al., 2016a). Wang et al. (2020) reported that 
CMIP6 models simulate the global monsoon domain and precipitation better (Figure 3.17a,b), albeit with 
biases in annual mean precipitation and the timings of onset and withdrawal of the SH monsoon. Notable 
inter-model differences were identified in CMIP5, with the multi-model ensemble mean outperforming 
individual models (Lee and Wang, 2014b). Common biases were identified across CMIP5 models in moist 
static energy and upper-tropospheric temperature associated with the South Asian summer monsoon, which 
may arise from overly smoothed model topography (Boos and Hurley, 2012). However, in atmospheric 
models with increasing resolution approaching 20 km, improvements in monsoon precipitation are not 
universal across regions and models, and overall improvements are unclear (Johnson et al., 2016; Ogata et 
al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018b). 
 
In instrumental records, global summer monsoon precipitation intensity (measured by summer precipitation 
averaged over the monsoon domain) decreased from the 1950s to 1980s, followed by an increase (Section 
2.3.1.4.2; Figure 3.17c), arising mainly from variations in Northern Hemispheric land monsoons. A CMIP5 
multi-model study by Zhang et al. (2018b) found that observed 1951-2004 trends of the global and NH 
summer land monsoon precipitation intensity are well captured by historical simulations, and CMIP6 models 
show similar results for global land summer monsoon precipitation (Figure 3.17c). However, the 1960s peak 
in the NH summer monsoon circulation is outside the 5th-95th percentile range of CMIP5 and CMIP6 
historical simulations for two out of three reanalyses (Figure 3.17d). Modelling studies show that greenhouse 
gas increases act to enhance NH summer monsoon precipitation intensity (Liu et al., 2012; Polson et al., 
2014; Chai et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018b). Since the mid-20th century, however, modelling studies show 
that this effect was overwhelmed by the influence of anthropogenic aerosols in CMIP5 (Polson et al., 2014; 
Guo et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2018c; Giannini and Kaplan, 2019) and in CMIP6 (Zhou et al., 2020b). 
Weakening of the monsoon circulation and reduction of moisture availability are important in this aerosol 
influence (Zhou et al., 2020b). Besides these human influences, the global monsoon is sensitive to internal 
variability and natural forcing including ENSO and volcanic aerosols on interannual time scales and PDV 
and AMV on decadal to multidecadal time scales (Wang et al., 2013a, 2018; Liu et al., 2016a; Jiang and 
Zhou, 2019; Zuo et al., 2019); though AMV in the 20th century may have been partly driven by aerosols, see 
Section 3.7.7. Indeed, AMIP simulations better reproduce the observed multidecadal variations of the global 
monsoon precipitation and circulation (Figure 3.17c,d). Zhang et al. (2018b) find that the multi-model 
ensemble mean trend of global land monsoon precipitation in historical simulations, dominated by 
anthropogenic aerosol forcing contributions, emerges out of the 90% range of internally-driven trends in pre-
industrial control simulations. However, it should be noted that CMIP5 models tend to underrepresent the 
PDV magnitude (Section 3.7.6), suggesting potential overconfidence on the detection of the forced signal. 
An observed enhancement in global summer monsoon precipitation since the 1980s is accompanied by an 
intensification of the NH summer monsoon circulation (Figure 3.17c,d). These trends appear to be at the 
extreme of the range of the CMIP6 historical simulation ensemble but well captured by AMIP simulations 
(Figure 3.17c,d). While the precipitation increase is consistent with greenhouse gas forcing, the circulation 
intensification is opposite to the simulated response to greenhouse gas forcing, and these enhancements have 
been attributed to PDV and AMV (Wang et al., 2013b; Kamae et al., 2017).  
 
In summary, while greenhouse gas increases acted to enhance the global land monsoon precipitation over the 
20th century (medium confidence), consistent with projected future enhancement (Section 4.5.1), this 
tendency was overwhelmed by anthropogenic aerosols from the 1950s to the 1980s, which contributed to 
weakening of global land summer monsoon precipitation intensity for this period (medium confidence). 
There is medium confidence that the intensification of global monsoon precipitation and NH summer 
monsoon circulation since the 1980s is dominated by internal variability. These assessments are supported 
respectively by multi-model detection and attribution studies which find an important role for anthropogenic 
aerosols in the weakening trend, and studies that identify a role for AMV and PDV in inducing the NH 
summer monsoon circulation enhancement since the 1980s. Supported by multi-model simulations that are 
qualitatively consistent with proxy evidence, there is high confidence that orbital forcing contributed to 
stronger NH monsoon precipitation in the mid-Pliocene and mid-Holocene than pre-industrial. While CMIP5 
models can capture the domain and precipitation intensity of the global monsoon, biases remain in their 
regional representations, and they are unsuccessful in quantitatively reproducing changes in paleo 
reconstructions (high confidence). CMIP6 models reproduce the domain and precipitation intensity of the 
global monsoon observed over the instrumental period better than CMIP5 models (medium confidence). 
However, CMIP5 and CMIP6 models fail to fully capture the variations of the NH summer monsoon 
circulation (Figure 3.17d), but there is low confidence to this assessment due to a lack of evidence in the 
literature.

### 3.3.3.3  Extratropical Jets, Storm Tracks and Blocking 
 
Extratropical jets are wind maxima in the upper troposphere which are often associated with storms, 
blocking, and weather extremes. Blocking refers to long-lived, stationary high-pressure systems that are 
often associated with a poleward displacement of the jet, causing cold spells in winter and heat waves in 
summer (e.g., Sousa et al., 2018). Sections 2.3.1.4.3, 8.3.2.7, and 11.7.2 discuss these features in more detail. 
 
AR5 concluded that models were able to capture the general characteristics of extratropical cyclones and 
storm tracks, although it also noted that most models underestimated cyclone intensity, that biases in cyclone 
frequency were linked to biases in sea surface temperatures, and that resolution can play a significant role in 
the quality of the simulation of storms (Flato et al., 2013). Similarly, AR5 found with high confidence that 
simulation of blocking was improved due to increases in resolution. AR5 did not specifically assess changes 
in Southern-Hemisphere storm track characteristics or blocking. 
 
Since AR5, new research using CMIP5 and CMIP6 models has confirmed that increasing the model 
resolution improves the simulation of cyclones and blocking in all seasons albeit with some exceptions and 
caveats (Zappa et al., 2013; Davini et al., 2017; Schiemann et al., 2017, 2020; Davini and D’Andrea, 2020; 
Priestley et al., 2020). New research also finds that model performance with respect to the simulation of 
cyclones and that of blocking events are correlated (Zappa et al., 2014), suggesting biases in both are aspects 
of the same underlying problem in models (Figure 3.18). In the North Pacific basin the annual-mean 
blocking frequency is now well simulated compared to earlier evaluations, but substantial errors in the 
blocking frequency remain in the Euro-Atlantic sector (Dunn-Sigouin and Son, 2013; Davini and D’Andrea, 
2016, 2020; Mitchell et al., 2017; Woollings et al., 2018; Figure 3.18). While there is a resolution 
dependence in the size of this bias, even at very high resolution blocking in the Euro-Atlantic sector remains 
underestimated (Schiemann et al., 2017), and there is evidence of a compensation of errors as the resolution 
is increased (Davini et al., 2017). Davini and D’Andrea (2020) show that while the simulation of blocking 
improves with increasing resolution in CMIP3, CMIP5, and CMIP6 models, other factors contribute to 
biases, particularly to the underestimation of Euro-Atlantic blocking (Schiemann et al., 2020). The 
persistence of blocking events, typically underestimated, has not improved from CMIP5 to CMIP6 
(Schiemann et al., 2020). Chapter 10.3.3.3 discusses the implications of the biases discussed here for 
regional climate. 
 
For the North Pacific storm track CMIP6 simulations exhibit large remaining underestimations of cyclone 
frequencies during summer (June to August), which for the low-resolution models have essentially remained 
unchanged versus CMIP5, and there is only a small resolution dependence of this bias (Priestley et al., 
2020). During winter (December to February), both CMIP5 and CMIP6 models tend to place the North 
Pacific storm track too far equatorward (Yang et al., 2018b; Priestley et al., 2020), leading to an 
overestimation of cyclones between 30 and 40°N in the Pacific and an underestimation to the north of this. 
Both low- and high-resolution models show this pattern, but low-resolution models generally simulate fewer 
cyclones throughout the North Pacific (Priestley et al., 2020).  
 
In winter, the North Atlantic storm track remains displaced to the south and east in many models (Harvey et 
al., 2020), leading to underestimations of cyclone frequencies near the North American coast and 
overestimations in the eastern North Atlantic. Higher-resolution CMIP6 models perform slightly better in 
this regard than low-resolution models. In summer (June to August), cyclone frequencies throughout the 
extratropical North Atlantic, which were substantially underestimated in CMIP5, have improved in CMIP6 
high-resolution models. In low-resolution CMIP6 models, the problem is essentially unchanged (Priestley et 
al., 2020); this is associated with generally underestimated variability of sea level pressure in CMIP models 
(Harvey et al., 2020). 
 
For the SH (not considered in AR5), (Priestley et al., 2020) find considerable improvement in the placement 
of the Southern Ocean storm track during summer (December to February) in CMIP6 models versus CMIP5, 
consistent with a more realistic annual mean surface wind maximum latitude in CMIP6 than in CMIP5 
(Goyal et al., 2021). Relative to CMIP5, both low- and high-resolution CMIP6 models have increased track 
densities south of about 55°S and decreases between about 40 and 55°S, in better agreement with 
observations than CMIP5 models (Parsons et al., 2016; Patterson et al., 2019). CMIP5 models and high-
resolution CMIP6 models simulate a storm track that is positioned too far equatorward, although the bias is 
smaller in the high-resolution models. By contrast, the low-resolution CMIP6 models simulate a storm track 
that is slightly too far poleward on average (Priestley et al., 2020). In winter (June to August), the biases 
found in CMIP5 are only slightly improved on in CMIP6, with models continuing to underestimate the broad 
maximum cyclone track density in the south-eastern Indian Ocean and overestimate the minimum in the 
south-western South Pacific (Priestley et al., 2020). 
 
There is only one contiguous blocking region in the SH, with the blocking frequency maximizing in the 
South Pacific and minimizing in the southern Indian Ocean regions (Parsons et al., 2016; Patterson et al., 
2019). CMIP5 simulations agree relatively well with ERA-Interim in this region regarding the distribution of 
blocking events (Parsons et al., 2016). Individual models exhibit considerable biases in the blocking 
frequency; however only in austral summer do Patterson et al. (2019) find a systematic, multi-model 
underestimation of the blocking frequency in and around the Tasman Sea. The blocking frequency is 
anticorrelated with the amplitude of the SAM. Ozone depletion, through stratosphere-troposphere coupling, 
may have caused an increase in the blocking frequency in the South Atlantic sector (Dennison et al., 2016); 
this finding requires confirmation using a multi-model approach.  
 
In addition to inadequate resolution, blocking and storm track biases in both hemispheres also result from 
mean state biases, in particular, biases related to the parameterization of orographic effects and to the 
misrepresentation of the Gulf Stream SST front (Anstey et al., 2013; Berckmans et al., 2013; Davini and 
D’Andrea, 2016b; O’Reilly et al., 2016b; Pithan et al., 2016; Schiemann et al., 2017). Overall SST biases 
have been suggested to have only a weak relevance to blocking (Davini and D’Andrea, 2016b). 
 
Section 2.3.1.4.3 assesses that the total number of extratropical cyclones has likely increased since the 1980s 
in the NH (low confidence), but with fewer deep cyclones particularly in summer. This observed reduction in 
cyclone activity by about 4% per decade in the NH in summer (Chang et al., 2016; Section 2.3.1.4.3) may be 
associated with human-induced warming. CMIP5 historical simulations generally reproduce a reduction but 
underestimate its magnitude (Chang et al., 2016). Furthermore, feedback mechanisms associated with clouds 
may be responsible for substantial inter-model spread (Chang et al., 2016; Voigt and Shaw, 2016). In boreal 
winter, recent studies have suggested a potential influence of the rapid Arctic warming on observed 
intensification of NH storm track activity in the past few decades, while other studies question this 
possibility (Cross-chapter Box 10.1).  
 
Section 2.3.1.4.3 assesses that the extratropical jets and cyclone tracks have likely been shifting poleward in 
both hemispheres since the 1980s with marked seasonality in trends (medium confidence). For the SH, 
studies using CMIP5 and other models imply that both ozone depletion and increasing greenhouse gases 
have caused substantial atmospheric circulation change since the 1960s when concentrations of ozone-
depleting substances started to increase (Eyring et al., 2013; Iglesias-Suarez et al., 2016; Karpechko et al., 
2018b; Son et al., 2018a). In particular, ozone depletion, during austral summer, has been linked to a 
poleward shift of the westerly jet and Southern-Hemisphere circulation zones and a southward expansion of 
the tropics (Kang et al., 2011), which is associated with a strengthening trend of the Southern Annular Mode 
(SAM; Section 3.7.2). This has been well reproduced by climate models with prescribed historical ozone 
concentration or interactive ozone chemistry (Gerber and Son, 2014; Son et al., 2018; Figure 3.19).  
 
In summary, there is low confidence that an observed decrease in the frequency of NH summertime 
extratropical cyclones is linked to anthropogenic influence. In the SH, there is high confidence that human 
influence, in the form of ozone depletion, has contributed to the observed poleward shift of the jet in austral 
summer, while confidence is low for human influence on historical blocking activity. The low confidence 
statements are due to the limited number of studies available. The shift of the SH jet is correlated with 
modulations of the SAM, and justification for the associated high confidence statement on attribution of 
changes in the SAM is provided in Section 3.7.2. There is medium confidence in model performance 
regarding the simulation of the extratropical jets, storm track and blocking activity, with increased resolution 
sometimes corresponding to better performance, but important shortcomings remain, particularly for the 
Euro-Atlantic sector of the NH. Nonetheless, synthesizing across Sections 3.3.3.1-3.3.3.3, there is high 
confidence that CMIP6 models capture the general characteristics of the tropospheric large-scale circulation.

### 3.3.3.4  Sudden Stratospheric Warming Activity 
 
Sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) are stratospheric weather events associated with anomalously high 
temperatures at high latitudes persisting from days to weeks. Section 2.3.1.4.5 discusses the definition and 
observational aspects of SSWs. SSWs are often associated with anomalous weather conditions, e.g. winter 
cold spells, in the lower atmosphere (e.g., Butler et al., 2015a; Baldwin et al., 2021). 
 
Seviour et al. (2016) found that stratosphere-resolving CMIP5 models, on average, reproduce the observed 
frequency of vortex splits (one form of SSWs) but with a wide range of model-specific biases. Models that 
produce a better mean state of the polar vortex also tend to produce a more realistic SSW frequency (Seviour 
et al., 2016). The mean sea level pressure anomalies occurring in CMIP5 model simulations when an SSW is 
underway however differs substantially from those in reanalyses (Seviour et al., 2016). Unlike stratosphere-
resolving models, models with limited stratospheric resolution, which make up more than half of the CMIP5 
ensemble, underestimate the frequency of SSWs (Osprey et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2017a). Taguchi (2017) 
found a general underestimation in CMIP5 models of the frequency of “major” SSWs (which are associated 
with a break-up of the polar vortex), an aspect of an underrepresentation in those models of dynamical 
variability in the stratosphere. Wu and Reichler (2020) found that finer vertical resolution in the stratosphere 
and a model top above the stratopause tend to be associated with a more realistic SSW frequency in CMIP5 
and CMIP6 models.  
 
Some studies find an increase in the frequency of SSWs under increasing greenhouse gases (e.g. Kim et al., 
2017a; Schimanke et al., 2013; Young et al., 2013). However, this behaviour is not robust across ensembles 
of chemistry-climate models (Mitchell et al., 2012; Ayarzagüena et al., 2018; Rao and Garfinkel, 2021). 
There is an absence of studies specifically focusing on simulated trends in SSWs during recent decades, and 
the short record and substantial decadal variability yields low confidence in any observed trends in the 
occurrence of SSW events in the NH winter (Section 2.3.1.4.5). Such an absence of a trend and large 
variability would also be consistent with a recent reconstruction of SSWs extending back to 1850, based on 
sea level pressure observations (Domeisen, 2019), although this time series has limitations as it is not based 
on direct observations of SSWs. 
 
In summary, an anthropogenic influence on the frequency or other aspects of SSWs has not yet been robustly 
detected. There is low confidence in the ability of models to simulate any such trends over the historical 
period because of large natural interannual variability and also due to common substantial biases in the 
simulated mean state affecting the simulated frequency of SSWs.  
 
 
# 3.4  Human Influence on the Cryosphere 
 
## 3.4.1  Sea Ice 
 
### 3.4.1.1  Arctic Sea Ice 
 
The AR5 concluded that “anthropogenic forcings are very likely to have contributed to Arctic sea ice loss 
since 1979” (Bindoff et al., 2013), based on studies showing that models can reproduce the observed decline 
only when including anthropogenic forcings, and formal attribution studies. Since the beginning of the 
modern satellite era in 1979, NH sea ice extent has exhibited significant declines in all months with the 
largest reduction in September (see Figures 3.20 and 3.21 and Section 2.3.2.1.1 for more details on observed 
changes). The recent Arctic sea ice loss during summer is unprecedented since 1850 (high confidence), but 
as in AR5 and SROCC there remains only medium confidence that the recent reduction is unique during at 
least past 1000 years due to sparse observations (Sections 2.3.2.1.1 and 9.3.1.1). CMIP5 models also 
simulate NH sea ice loss over the satellite era but with large differences among models (e.g., Massonnet et 
al., 2012; Stroeve et al., 2012). The envelope of simulated ice loss across model simulations encompasses the 
observed change, although observations fall near the low end of the CMIP5 and CMIP6 distributions of 
trends (Figure 3.20). CMIP6 models on average better capture the observed Arctic sea ice decline, albeit 
with large inter-model spread. Notz et al. (2020) found that CMIP6 models better reproduce the sensitivity of 
Arctic sea ice area to CO2 emissions and global warming than earlier CMIP models although the models’ 
underestimation of this sensitivity remains. Davy and Outten (2020) also found that CMIP6 models can 
simulate the seasonal cycle of Arctic sea ice extent and volume better than CMIP5 models. For the 
assessment of physical processes associated with changes in Arctic sea ice, see Section 9.3.1.1. 
 
Since AR5, there have been several new detection and attribution studies on Arctic sea ice. While the 
attribution literature has mostly used sea ice extent (SIE), it is closely proportional to sea ice area (SIA; Notz, 
2014), which is assessed in Chapters 2 and 9 and shown in Figures 3.20 and 3.21. Kirchmeier-Young et al. 
(2017) compared the observed time series of the September SIE over the period 1979-2012 with those from 
different large ensemble simulations which provide a robust sampling of internal climate variability 
(CanESM2, CESM1, and CMIP5) using an optimal fingerprinting technique. They detected anthropogenic 
signals which were separable from the response to natural forcing due to solar irradiance variations and 
volcanic aerosol, supporting previous findings (Figure 3.21; Kay et al., 2011; Min et al., 2008; Notz and 
Marotzke, 2012; Notz and Stroeve, 2016). Using selected CMIP5 models and three independently derived 
sets of observations, Mueller et al. (2018) detected fingerprints from greenhouse gases, natural, and other 
anthropogenic forcings simultaneously in the September Arctic SIE over the period 1953-2012. They further 
showed that about a quarter of the greenhouse gas induced decrease in SIE has been offset by an increase 
due to other anthropogenic forcing (mainly aerosols). Similarly, Gagné et al. (2017a) suggested that the 
observed increase in Arctic sea ice concentration over the 1950-1975 period was primarily due to the cooling 
contribution of anthropogenic aerosols forcing based on single model simulations. Gagné et al. (2017b) 
identified a detectable increase in Arctic SIE in response to volcanic eruptions using CMIP5 models and four 
observational datasets. Polvani et al. (2020) suggested that ozone depleting substances played a substantial 
role in the Arctic sea ice loss over the 1955-2005 period. 
 
Differences in sea ice loss among the models (Figure 3.20) have been attributed to a number of factors (see 
also Section 9.3.1.1). These factors include the late 20th century simulated sea ice state (Massonnet et al., 
2012), the magnitude of changing ocean heat transport (Mahlstein and Knutti, 2011), and the rate of global 
warming (e.g., Gregory et al., 2002; Mahlstein and Knutti, 2012; Rosenblum and Eisenman, 2017). Sea ice 
thermodynamic considerations indicate that the magnitude of sea ice variability and loss depends on ice 
thickness (Bitz, 2008; Massonnet et al., 2018) and hence the climatology simulated by different models may 
influence their projections of change (medium confidence), as indicated by the regression lines in Figure 
3.20.  
 
An important consideration in comparing Arctic sea ice loss in models and observations is the role of 
internal variability (medium confidence). Using ensemble simulations from a single model, Kay et al. (2012) 
suggested that internal variability could account for about half of the observed September ice loss. More 
recently, large ensemble simulations have been performed with many more ensemble members (Kay et al., 
2015). These enable a more robust characterization of internal variability in the presence of forced 
anthropogenic change. Using such large ensembles, some studies discussed the influence of internal 
variability on Arctic sea ice trends (Swart et al., 2015). Song et al. (2016) also compared the trends in the 
forced and unforced simulations using multiple climate models and found that internal variability explains 
about 40% of the observed September sea ice melting trend, supporting previous studies (Stroeve et al., 
2012). Based on the large ensembles of CESM1 and CanESM2, September Arctic sea ice extent variance 
first increases and then decreases as SIE declines from its pre-industrial value (Kirchmeier-Young et al., 
2017; Mueller et al., 2018) consistent with previous work (Goosse et al., 2009), but neither study found a 
strong sensitivity of detection and attribution results to the change in variability. Further work has indicated 
that internally-driven summer atmospheric circulation trends with enhanced atmospheric ridges over 

Greenland and the Arctic Ocean, which project on the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation 
(Section 3.7.1), play an important role in the observed Arctic sea ice loss (Hanna et al., 2015; Ding et al., 
2017). A fingerprint analysis using the CESM large ensemble suggests that this internal variability accounts 
for 40-50% of the observed September Arctic sea ice decline (Ding et al., 2019; England et al., 2019). 
Internally-generated decadal tropical variability and associated atmospheric teleconnections were suggested 
to have contributed to the changing atmospheric circulation in the Arctic and the associated rapid sea ice 
decline from 2000 to 2014 (Meehl et al., 2018). 
 
Some recent studies evaluated the human contribution to recent record minimum SIE events in the Arctic. 
Analysing CMIP5 simulations, Zhang and Knutson (2013) found that the observed 2012 record low in 
September Arctic SIE is inconsistent with internal climate variability alone. Based on several large 
ensembles, Kirchmeier-Young et al. (2017) concluded that the observed 2012 SIE minimum cannot be 
reproduced in a simulation excluding human influence. Fučkar et al. (2016) showed that climate change 
contributed to the record low March Arctic SIE in 2015, which was accompanied by the record minimum 
SIE in the Sea of Okhotsk (Paik et al., 2017). 
 
Based on the new attribution studies since AR5, we conclude that it is very likely that anthropogenic forcing 
mainly due to greenhouse gas increases was the main driver of Arctic sea ice loss since 1979. Increases in 
anthropogenic aerosols have offset part of the greenhouse gas induced Arctic sea ice loss since the 1950s 
(medium confidence). Despite large differences in the mean sea ice state in the Arctic, Arctic sea ice loss is 
captured by all CMIP5 and CMIP6 models. Nonetheless, large inter-model differences in the Arctic sea ice 
decline remain, limiting our ability to quantify forced changes and internal variability contributions.

### 3.4.1.2  Antarctic Sea Ice  
 
AR5 concluded that “there is low confidence in the attribution of the observed increase in Antarctic SIE 
since 1979” (Bindoff et al., 2013) due to the limited understanding of the external forcing contribution as 
well as the role of internal variability. Based on a difference between the first and last decades, Antarctic sea 
ice cover exhibited a small increase in summer and winter over the 1979-2017 period (Section 2.3.2.1.2; 
Figures 3.20 and 3.21). However, these changes are not statistically significant and starting in late 2016, 
anomalously low sea ice area has been observed (Section 2.3.2.1.2). The mean hemispheric sea ice changes 
result from much larger, but partially compensating, regional changes with increases in the western Ross Sea 
and Weddell Sea and declines in the Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas (Hobbs et al., 2016). Observed 
regional trends have been particularly large in austral autumn (see Section 2.3.2.1.2, and also Section 9.3.2.1 
for more details of regional changes and related physical processes). Starting in austral spring of 2016, the 
ice extent decreased strongly (Turner et al., 2017) and has since remained anomalously low (Figure 3.21). 
This decrease has been associated with anomalous atmospheric conditions associated with teleconnections 
from warming in the eastern Indian Ocean and a negative Southern Annular Mode (Chenoli et al., 2017; 
Stuecker et al., 2017; Schlosser et al., 2018; Meehl et al., 2019; Purich and England, 2019; Wang et al., 
2019a). A decadal-scale warming of the near-surface ocean that resulted from strengthened westerlies may 
also have contributed to and helped to sustain the sea ice loss (Meehl et al., 2019). Before satellites and on 
even longer time scales, very limited observational data and proxy coverage leads to low confidence in all 
aspects of Antarctic sea-ice (Section 2.3.2.1.2; 9.3.2.1). 
 
CMIP5 climate models generally simulate Antarctic sea ice loss over the satellite era since 1979 (Mahlstein 
et al., 2013; Turner et al., 2013) in contrast to the observed change, and CMIP6 models also simulate 
Antarctic ice loss (Roach et al., 2020; Figure 3.20 and 3.21). A number of studies have suggested that this 
discrepancy may be in part due to the role of internal variability in the observed change (Mahlstein et al., 
2013; Polvani and Smith, 2013; Zunz et al., 2013; Meehl et al., 2016a; Turner et al., 2016), including 
teleconnections associated with tropical Pacific variability (Meehl et al., 2016a) and changing surface 
conditions resulting from multi-decadal ocean circulation variations (Singh et al., 2019). However, when the 
spatial pattern is considered, trends in the summer and autumn (from 1979-2005) appear outside the range of 
internal variability (Hobbs et al., 2015). This suggests that the models may exhibit an unrealistic simulation 
of the Antarctic sea ice forced response or the internal variability of the system. Discrepancies among the 
models in simulated sea ice variability (Zunz et al., 2013), the sea ice climatological state (Roach et al., 
2018), upper ocean temperature trends (Schneider and Deser, 2018), SH westerly wind trends (Purich et al., 
2016), or the sea ice response to Southern Annular Mode variations (Ferreira et al., 2014; Holland et al., 
2017; Kostov et al., 2017; Landrum et al., 2017) may all play some role in explaining these differences with 
the observed trends. Increased fresh water fluxes caused by mass loss of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (either by 
melting at the front of ice shelves or via iceberg calving) have been suggested as a possible mechanism 
driving the multidecadal Antarctic sea ice expansion (Bintanja et al., 2015; Pauling et al., 2016) but there is a 
lack of consensus on this mechanism’s impacts (Pauling et al., 2017). A recent study based on decadal 
predictability suggests that initializing the state of the Antarctic bottom water cell can reproduce the observed 
Antarctic sea ice increase (Zhang et al., 2017), consistent with the suggestion that multidecadal variability 
associated with variations in deep convection has contributed to the observed increase in Antarctic sea ice 
since 1979 (Latif et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2017, 2019a) (see also Section 9.3.2.1).  
 
There have been several studies which aimed to identify causes of the observed Antarctic SIE changes. 
Gagné et al. (2015) assessed the consistency of observed and simulated changes in Antarctic SIE for an 
extended period using recovered satellite-based estimates, and found that the observed trends since the mid-
1960s are not inconsistent with model simulated trends. Studies based on the satellite period also indicate 
that the observed trends are largely within the range of simulated internal variability (Hobbs et al., 2016). A 
few distinct factors that led to the weak signal-to-noise ratio in Antarctic SIE trends have been further 
identified, which include large multi-decadal variability (Monselesan et al., 2015), the short observational 
record (e.g., Abram et al., 2013), and the limited model performance at representing the complex Antarctic 
climate system as discussed above (Bintanja et al., 2013; Uotila et al., 2014). The short period of 
comprehensive satellite observations, beginning in 1979, makes it challenging to set the observed increase 
between 1979 and 2015, or the subsequent decrease, in a long-term context, and to assess whether the 
difference in trend between observations and models, which mostly simulate long-term decreases, is 
systematic or a rare expression of internal variability on decadal-to-multidecadal timescales. 
 
In conclusion, the observed small increase in Antarctic sea ice extent during the satellite era is not generally 
captured by global climate models, and there is low confidence in attributing the causes of the change.

## 3.4.2  Snow Cover 
 
Seasonal snow cover is a defining climate feature of the northern continents. It is therefore of considerable 
interest that climate models correctly simulate this feature. It is discussed in more detail in Section 9.5.3, and 
observational aspects of snow cover are assessed in Section 2.3.2.2. 
 
AR5 noted the strong linear correlation between NH snow cover extent (SCE) and annual-mean surface air 
temperature in CMIP5 models. It was assessed as likely that there had been an anthropogenic contribution to 
observed reductions in NH snow cover since 1970 (Bindoff et al., 2013). AR5 assessed that CMIP5 models 
reproduced key features of observed snow cover well, including the seasonal cycle of snow cover over 
northern regions of Eurasia and North America, but had more difficulties in more southern regions with 
intermittent snow cover. AR5 also found that CMIP5 models underestimate the observed reduction in spring 
snow cover over this period (see also Brutel-Vuilmet et al., 2013; Thackeray et al., 2016; Santolaria-Otín and 
Zolina, 2020; Figure 3.22). This behaviour has been linked to how the snow-albedo feedback is represented 
in models (Thackeray et al., 2018). The CMIP5 multi-model ensemble has been shown to represent the 
snow-albedo feedback more realistically than CMIP3, although models from some individual modelling 
centres have not improved or have even got worse (Thackeray et al., 2018). There is still a systematic 
overestimation of the albedo of boreal forest covered in snow (Li et al., 2016c; Thackeray et al., 2015). 
Consequently, the snow albedo feedback might have been overestimated by CMIP5 models (Xiao et al., 
2017; Section 9.5.3). 
 
<figref>3.22</figref> 
 
CMIP6 models improve on CMIP5 models in producing slightly increased SCE versus CMIP5, correcting 
the low bias in CMIP5 mentioned above (Mudryk et al., 2020). The linear relationship noted above between 
GSAT and SCE also exists in CMIP6 (Mudryk et al., 2020). Like CMIP5, the CMIP6 models capture the 
negative trend in spring snow cover that has occurred in recent decades (Figure 3.22). However, the median 
CMIP6 model now produces slightly stronger post-1981 declines in the March-April mean SCE than the 
CMIP5 median (Mudryk et al., 2020). Until about 1980, the models produce a generally stable March-April 
SCE, but after that a substantial decline, reaching a loss of about 2 × 106 km2 in 2012-2017 relative to the 
1971-2000 average. Compared to earlier studies which found that models underestimate observed trends for 
the 1979-2005 period (Brutel-Vuilmet et al., 2013), both CMIP5 and CMIP6 models show improved 
agreement with the observations over the period to 2017 (Figure 3.22). One remaining concern is a failure of 
most CMIP6 models to correctly represent the relationship between snow cover extent and snow mass, 
reflecting too slow seasonal increases and decreases of SCE in the models (Mudryk et al., 2020). 
 
Several CMIP5 and CMIP6 based studies have consistently attributed the observed NH spring SCE changes 
(Section 2.3.2.2) to anthropogenic influences (Rupp et al., 2013; Najafi et al., 2016; Paik and Min, 2020), 
with the observed changes being found to be inconsistent with natural variability alone. Similarly, spring 
snow thickness (Snow Water Equivalent) changes on the scale of the NH have been attributed to greenhouse 
gas forcing (Jeong et al., 2017). Using individual forcing simulations from multiple CMIP6 models, Paik and 
Min (2020) detected greenhouse gas influence in the observed decrease of early spring SCE during 1925-
2019, which was found to be separable from the responses to other forcings.  
 
In summary, it is very likely that anthropogenic influence contributed to the observed reductions in NH 
springtime snow cover since 1950. CMIP6 models better represent the seasonality and geographical 
distribution of snow cover than CMIP5 simulations (high confidence). Both CMIP5 and CMIP6 models 
simulate strong declines in spring-time SCE during recent years, in general agreement with observations, 
causing the multi-model mean decreasing trend in spring-time SCE to now better agree with observations 
than in earlier evaluations. Evidence has yet to emerge that interactions between vegetation and snow, found 
problematic in CMIP5, have indeed improved in CMIP6 models (Section 9.5.3). Such deficiencies in the 
representation of snow in climate models mean there is medium confidence in the simulation of snow cover 
over the northern continents in CMIP6 model simulations. The models consistently link snow extent to 
surface air temperature (Figure 9.24). With warming of near-surface air linked to anthropogenic influence, 
and particularly to greenhouse gas increases (Section 3.3.1), this provides additional evidence that reductions 
in snow cover are also caused by human activity. 
 

## 3.4.3  Glaciers and Ice Sheets 
 
While Chapter 9 (Sections 9.4 and 9.5) discusses process understanding for glaciers and ice sheets, as well as 
evaluation of global and regional-scale glacier and ice sheet models, our focus here is on the attribution of 
large-scale changes in glaciers and ice sheets. Land ice in the form of glaciers has been included in CMIP 
climate and Earth system models as components of the land surface models for many years. However, their 
representation is simplified and is omitted altogether in the less complex modelling systems. In CMIP3 
(Meehl et al., 2007) and CMIP5 (Taylor et al., 2012) land ice area fraction, a component of land surface 
models, was defined as a time-independent quantity, and in most model configurations was preset at the 
simulation initialization as a permanent land feature. In CMIP6 considerable progress has been made in 
improving and evaluating the representation of modelled land ice. For glaciers, an example is the expansion 
of the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) land surface model to enable elevated tiles, and hence 
more accurately simulate the altitudinal atmospheric effects on glaciers (Shannon et al., 2019). Moreover, 
standalone glacier models have now been systematically compared in GlacierMIP (Hock et al., 2019a; 
Marzeion et al., 2020). The Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets were absent in global climate models that 
pre-date CMIP6 (Eyring et al., 2016a), however some preliminary analyses that used results from CMIP5 to 
drive standalone ice sheet models were included in AR5 (Church et al., 2013b). For the first time in CMIP, 
the latest CMIP6 phase includes a coordinated effort to simulate temporally evolving ice sheets within the 
Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project (ISMIP6; Box 9.3; Nowicki et al., 2016). Our understanding of 
aspects of the global water storage contained in glaciers and ice sheets, and their contribution to sea-level 
rise, has improved since the AR5 and SROCC (Hock et al., 2019b; Meredith et al., 2019) both in models and 
observations (see assessment of observations and model evaluation for the Greenland Ice Sheet in Sections 
2.3.2.4.1 and 9.4.1; Antarctica in Sections 2.3.2.4.2 and 9.4.2; and glaciers in Sections 2.3.2.3 and 9.5.1).  
 
 
### 3.4.3.1  Glaciers 

Glaciers are defined as perennial surface land ice masses independent of the Antarctic and Greenland ice 
sheets (Sections 9.5, 2.3.2.3). AR5 assessed that anthropogenic influence had likely contributed to the retreat 
of glaciers observed since the 1960s (Bindoff et al., 2013), based on a high level of scientific understanding 
and robust estimates of observed mass loss, internal variability, and glacier response to climatic drivers. 
SROCC (Hock et al., 2019b) concluded that atmospheric warming was very likely the primary driver of 
glacier recession. 
 
Simulations of glacier mass changes under climate change rely on glacier models driven by climate model 
output, often in collaborative research efforts such as GlacierMIP (Hock et al., 2019a; Marzeion et al., 2020). 
The GlacierMIP project is a systematic coordinated modelling effort designed to further understanding of 
glacier loss using global models. While the low resolution and remaining biases of climate model-derived 
boundary forcing data is a limitation, the release of the Randolph Glacier Inventory (Pfeffer et al., 2014; RGI 
Consortium, 2017) has supported more sophisticated, systematic and comprehensive modelling of glaciers 
worldwide (Hock et al., 2019a). 
 
A regional study considering 85 NH glacier systems concluded that there is a discernible human influence on 
glacier mass balance, with glacier model simulations driven by CMIP5 historical and greenhouse gas-only 
simulations showing a glacier mass loss, whereas those driven by natural-only forced simulations showed a 
net glacier growth (Hirabayashi et al., 2016). In addition, a study of the role of climate change in glacier 
retreat using a simple mass-balance model for 37 glaciers worldwide, concluded that observed length 
changes would not have occurred without anthropogenic climate change, with observed length variations 
exceeding those associated with internal variability by several standard deviations in many cases (Roe et al., 
2017). Roe et al. (2020) used the same model to estimate that at least 85% of cumulative glacier mass loss 
since 1850 is attributable to anthropogenic influence. While Marzeion et al. (2014) found that anthropogenic 
influence contributed only 25 ± 35% of glacier mass loss for the period 1851-2010, their naturally-forced 
simulations exhibited a substantial negative mass balance, which Roe et al. (2020) argued is unrealistic. 
Moreover, Marzeion et al. (2014) estimated that anthropogenic influence contributed 69 ± 24% of glacier 
mass loss for the period 1991 to 2010, consistent with a progressively increasing fraction of mass loss 
attributable to anthropogenic influence found by Roe et al. (2020). 
 
In summary, considering together the SROCC assessment that atmospheric warming was very likely the 
primary driver of glacier recession, the results of Roe et al. (2017, 2020) and our assessment of the dominant 
role of anthropogenic influence in driving atmospheric warming (Section 3.3.1), we conclude that human 
influence is very likely the main driver of the near-universal retreat of glaciers globally since the 1990s.  
 
 
### 3.4.3.2  Ice Sheets 
 
#### Greenland Ice Sheet 
AR5 assessed that it is likely that anthropogenic forcing contributed to the surface melting of the Greenland 
Ice Sheet since 1993 (Bindoff et al., 2013). SROCC did not directly assess the attribution of Greenland Ice 
Sheet change to anthropogenic forcing, but it did assess with medium confidence that summer melting of the 
Greenland Ice Sheet has increased to a level unprecedented over at least the last 350 years, which is two-to-
fivefold the pre-industrial level (see also Trusel et al.; 2018). 
 
Section 2.3.2.4.1 assesses that Greenland ice sheet mass loss began in the latter half of the 19th century and 
the rate of loss has increased substantially since the turn of the 21st century (high confidence), and also notes 
that integration of proxy evidence and modelling indicates that the last time the rate of mass loss was similar 
to the 20th century rate was during the early Holocene. Models of Greenland Ice Sheet evolution are 
evaluated in detail in Section 9.4.1.2, which assesses that there is overall medium confidence in these models. 
Model evaluation of surface mass balance changes over the Greenland Ice Sheet, including regional aspects, 
is also assessed in Atlas.11.2.3. 
 
Detection and attribution studies of change in the Greenland Ice Sheet remain challenging (Kjeldsen et al., 
2015; Bamber et al., 2019). This is in part due to the short observational record (Shepherd et al., 2012, 2018, 
2020; Bamber et al., 2018; Cazenave et al., 2018; Mouginot et al., 2019; Rignot et al., 2019) and the 
challenges this poses to the evaluation of modelling efforts (Section 9.4.1). The latter require not only 
dynamic ice sheet models, but also appropriate atmospheric and oceanic conditions to use as a boundary 
forcing to drive the models (Nowicki and Seroussi, 2018; Barthel et al., 2020). Nonetheless, new literature 
since AR5 finds that ice sheet mass balance calculations using reanalysis-driven regional model simulations 
of surface mass balance, are found to agree well with the observed decrease in ice sheet mass over the past 
twenty years (Fettweis et al., 2020; Sasgen et al., 2020a; Tedesco and Fettweis, 2020a), consistent with 
earlier studies (Flato et al., 2013). These studies also show that the exceptional melt events observed in 2012 
and 2019 were associated with exceptional atmospheric conditions (Sasgen et al., 2020a; Tedesco and 
Fettweis, 2020b). These results support the finding that increased surface melting is associated with 
warming, although atmospheric circulation anomalies, including the summer North Atlantic Oscillation 
(NAO) and variations in snowfall play an important role in driving interannual variations (Sasgen et al., 
2020; Tedesco and Fettweis, 2020; Section 9.4.1.1). Further, a coupled ice-sheet-climate model study found 
emergence of decreased surface mass balance prior to the present day in coastal locations in Greenland, 
which dominate the integrated surface mass balance (Fyke et al., 2014), suggesting that observed variations 
in surface mass balance in these regions might be expected to be distinguishable from internal variability. A 
CMIP6 simulation of the historical period showed stable Greenland surface mass balance up to the 1990s, 
after which it declined due to increased melt and runoff, consistent with a downscaled reanalysis 
(van Kampenhout et al., 2020). Further, all experts surveyed in a structured expert judgement exercise 
examining the causes of the increase in mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet over the last two decades 
(Bamber et al., 2019) concluded that external forcing was responsible for at least 50% of the mass loss. A 
comparison of Greenland Ice Sheet mass loss trends from observations and AR5 model projections for the 
period 2007-2017 found that observed surface mass balance trends were at the top of the AR5 assessed 
range, while mass loss due to changing ice dynamics was near the centre of the AR5 range (Slater et al., 
2020), providing further evidence of consistent anthropogenically-forced mass loss trends in models and 
observations.  
 
Drawing together the evidence from the continued and strengthened observed mass loss, the agreement 
between anthropogenically forced climate simulations and observations, and historical and paleo evidence 
for the unusualness of the observed rate of surface melting and mass loss, we assess that it is very likely that 
human influence has contributed to the observed surface melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet over the past 
two decades, and there is medium confidence in an anthropogenic contribution to recent overall mass loss 
from Greenland.  
 
#### Antarctic Ice Sheet 
AR5 assessed that there was low confidence in attributing the causes of the observed mass loss from the 
Antarctic ice sheet since 1993 (Bindoff et al., 2013). SROCC assessed that there is medium agreement but 
limited evidence of anthropogenic forcing of Antarctic mass balance through both surface mass balance and 
glacier dynamics. It further assessed that Antarctic ice loss is dominated by acceleration, retreat and rapid 
thinning of the major West Antarctic Ice Sheet outlet glaciers (very high confidence), driven by melting of 
ice shelves by warm ocean waters (high confidence). Based on updated observations, Chapter 2 assesses that 
there is very high confidence that the Antarctic Ice Sheet lost mass between 1992 and 2017, and that there is 
medium confidence that this mass loss has accelerated. Models of Antarctic Ice Sheet evolution are evaluated 
in detail in Section 9.4.2.2, which assesses that there is medium confidence in many ice sheet processes 
inAntarctic ice sheet models, but low confidence in the ocean forcing affecting basal melt rates. CMIP5 and 
CMIP6 models perform similarly in their simulation of Antarctic surface mass balance (Section 9.4.2.2, 
Gorte et al., 2020). Model evaluation of surface mass balance over the Antarctic Ice Sheet, including 
regional aspects, is also assessed in Atlas.11.1.3. 
 
Ice discharge around the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is strongly influenced by variability in basal melt (Jenkins 
et al., 2018; Hoffman et al., 2019), in particular at decadal and longer time scales (Snow et al., 2017). Basal 
melt rate variability can be induced by wind-driven ocean current changes, which may partly be of 
anthropogenic origin via greenhouse gas forcing (Holland et al., 2019). Moreover, ice discharge losses from 
the Antarctic Ice Sheet over the 2007-2017 period are close to the centre of the model-based range projected 
in AR5 (Slater et al., 2020). However, expert opinion differs as to whether recent Antarctic ice loss from the 
West Antarctic Ice Sheet has been driven primarily by external forcing or by internal variability, and there is 
no consensus (Bamber et al., 2019). Anthropogenic influence on the Antarctic surface mass balance, which 
is expected to partially compensate for ice discharge losses through increases in snowfall, is currently 
masked by strong natural variability (Previdi and Polvani, 2016; Bodart and Bingham, 2019), and 
observations suggest that it has been close to zero over recent years (Slater et al., 2020) (see further 
discussion in Section 9.4.2.1).  
 
Overall, there is medium agreement but limited evidence of anthropogenic influence on Antarctic mass 
balance through changes in ice discharge. 
  
# 3.5  Human Influence on the Ocean 
 
The global ocean plays an important role in the climate system, as it is responsible for transporting and 
storing large amounts of heat (Sections 3.5.1 and 9.2.2.1), freshwater (Sections 3.5.2 and 9.2.2.2) and carbon 
(Sections 3.6.2 and 5.2.1.3) that are exchanged with the atmosphere. Therefore, accurate ocean simulation in 
climate models is essential for the realistic representation of the climatic response to anthropogenic warming, 
including rates of warming, sea level rise and carbon uptake, and the representation of coupled modes of 
climate variability. 
 
Ocean model development has advanced considerably since AR5 (Section 1.5.3.1). Ongoing model 
developments since AR5 have focused on improving the realism of the simulated ocean in coupled models, 
with horizontal resolutions increasing to 10-100 km (from about 200 km in CMIP5), and increased vertical 
resolutions in many modelling systems of 0-1 m for near-surface levels (from the highest resolution of 10 m 
in CMIP5). These developments are aimed at improving the representation of the diurnal cycle and coupling 
to the atmosphere (e.g. Bernie et al. 2005, 2007, 2008). General improvements to simulated ocean fidelity in 
response to increasing resolution are expected (Hewitt et al., 2017). The effects of model resolution on the 
fidelity of ocean models are discussed in more detail in Sections 9.2.2 and 9.2.4. 
 
In this section we assess the global and basin-scale properties of the simulated ocean, with a focus on 
evaluation of the realism of simulated ocean properties, and the detection and attribution of human-induced 
changes in the ocean over the period of observational coverage. Observed changes to ocean temperature 
(Section 2.3.3.1), salinity (Section 2.3.3.2), sea level (Section 2.3.3.3) and ocean circulation (Section 2.3.3.4) 
are reported in Chapter 2. A more process-based assessment of ocean changes, alongside the assessment of 
variability and changes in ocean properties with spatial scales smaller than ocean basin scales is presented in 
Chapter 9. 
 
 
## 3.5.1  Ocean Temperature 
 
Ocean temperature and ocean heat content are key physical variables considered for climate model 
evaluation and are primary indicators of a changing ocean climate. This section assesses the performance of 
climate models in representing the mean state ocean temperature and heat content (Section 3.5.1.1), with a 
particular focus on the tropical oceans given the importance of air-sea coupling in these areas (Section 
3.5.1.2). This is followed by an assessment of detection and attribution studies of changes in ocean 
temperature and heat content (Section 3.5.1.3). Changes in global surface temperature are assessed in Section 
3.3.1.1. 
 
 
### 3.5.1.1  Sea Surface and Zonal Mean Ocean Temperature Evaluation 
 
In CMIP3 and CMIP5 models, large SST biases were found in the mid and high latitudes (Flato et al., 2013). 
In CMIP6, the NH mid-latitude surface temperature biases appear to be marginally improved in the multi-
model mean when contrasted to CMIP5 despite large biases remaining in a few models (Figure 3.23a, Figure 
3.24). There is a decreased spread of the zonal mean SST error between 50°N and 30°S, relative to CMIP5 
(Figure 3.24a). On the other hand, the Southern Ocean’s warm surface temperature bias remains (Figure 
3.23a; Beadling et al., 2020), and is on average larger in CMIP6 than in CMIP5 models (Figure 3.23a, Figure 
3.24). This warm bias is often associated with persistent overlying atmospheric cloud biases (Hyder et al., 
2018). Several other large biases also appear to remain largely unresolved in CMIP6, particularly warm 
biases in excess of 1°C along the equatorial eastern continental boundaries of the tropical Atlantic and 
Pacific Oceans (Figure 3.23a). 
 
Overall, the simulated and observed trends in SST patterns are generally consistent for the historical period 
(Olonscheck et al., 2020). The CMIP6 models generally represent the observed pattern of trends better than 
the CMIP5 models, and observed trends fall within the range of simulated trends over a larger area for 
CMIP6 models than for CMIP5 models (Olonscheck et al., 2020). 
 
The CMIP5 multi-model mean zonally averaged subsurface ocean temperature showed warm biases between 
200 m and 2000 m (mid-depth) over most latitudes, with exceptions in the Southern Ocean (>60°S, 100-
2000 m) and upper (0-400 m) Arctic Ocean. Cold biases were simulated near the surface (0-200 m) at most 
latitudes (Flato et al., 2013). CMIP6 biases are broadly consistent with those reported in CMIP5 for the near-
surface (<200 m) and mid-depth (200-2000 m) ocean (Voldoire et al., 2019b; Beadling et al., 2020; Zhu et 
al., 2020b). The warm bias begins between 100 and 400 m depth in all three basins, however, it is most 
prominent in the Atlantic Ocean, with a maximum magnitude in the equatorial latitudes, as in CMIP5 (Figure 
3.25). In the Pacific, the large warm biases are mostly seen in the subtropical regions (30-60°N and 30-
60°S). The cool near surface tropical bias is most prominent in the Pacific Ocean and also present in the 
Atlantic, with a smaller magnitude (Figure 3.25). Relative to CMIP5, the most prominent difference is an 
increase to the mid-depth (300-2000 m) warm bias in CMIP6 relative to CMIP5, and a change in sign of the 
bias from cold to warm for the Southern Ocean mid-depth (>60oS) from CMIP5 to CMIP6 (Figure 3.25). 
Compared to CMIP3 and CMIP5, there is improved agreement between most CMIP6 models and 
observations in their representation of the zonal mean temperature of the upper 100 m of the Southern Ocean 
(Beadling et al., 2020). 
 
Focusing on the deep ocean (>2000 m), the CMIP6 ensemble mean shows a prominent and consistent warm 
bias (Figure 3.25), in all basins except the equatorial and northern Pacific, which contrasts to a cold bias seen 
in CMIP5 (Flato et al., 2013). We note that while an updated observational temperature dataset is used in this 
assessment (WOA09 was used in AR5, while WOA18, 1981-2010 is used in AR6), the deep ocean warm 
bias remains and is approaching double the magnitude (~0.5°C) of the equivalent CMIP5 multi-model mean 
bias, a feature which is particularly prominent in the Atlantic and southern Indian Oceans. Increased 
horizontal resolution as well as the choice of the vertical coordinate are reported to partly improve these 
biases in some models (Adcroft et al., 2019; Rackow et al., 2019; Hewitt et al., 2020). 
 
Since AR5, there has been growing evidence that the representation of mean surface and deeper ocean 
temperatures in coupled climate models can be improved by increasing the horizontal resolution both in the 
ocean and the atmosphere (e.g. Small et al., 2014; Hewitt et al., 2016; Iovino et al., 2016; Roberts et al., 
2019). At an ocean resolution of around 1°, which is typical of CMIP6 models, some processes are 
parameterized rather than explicitly resolved, leading to a compromise in their dynamical representation. An 
increase in the model resolution allows for processes to be explicitly resolved, and can for example, enhance 
the simulation of eddies, thus improving simulated vertical eddy transport, and reducing temperature drifts in 
the deeper ocean (Griffies et al., 2015; von Storch et al., 2016). For some models, the mean absolute error in 
ocean temperature below 500 m is smaller in the high resolution version compared to the low resolution 
version, particularly in eddy-active regions such as the North Atlantic (Rackow et al., 2019). Increasing the 
horizontal resolution of individual climate models often leads to an overall decrease in the surface 
temperature biases over regions where they persisted through earlier CMIP generations, such as the central 
and western equatorial Pacific, as well as the North and tropical Atlantic (Figure 3.3e; Roberts et al., 2019; 
Hewitt et al., 2020). Despite this, as a group the four HighResMIP models included in Figures 3.3e and 3.24 
do not on average show smaller SST biases than the CMIP6 multi-model mean, demonstrating the 
importance of factors other than resolution in contributing to SST biases.  
 
In summary, there is little improvement in the multi-model mean sea surface and zonal mean ocean 
temperatures from CMIP5 to CMIP6 (medium confidence). Nevertheless, the CMIP6 models show a 
somewhat more realistic pattern of SST trends (low confidence).

### 3.5.1.2  Tropical Sea Surface Temperature Evaluation 
 
#### Tropical Pacific Ocean 
In CMIP5, mean state biases in the tropical Pacific Ocean including the excessive equatorial cold tongue, 
erroneous mean thermocline depth and slope along the equator remained but were improved relative to 
CMIP3 (Flato et al., 2013). Misrepresentation of the interaction between the atmosphere and ocean via the 
Bjerknes feedback and vertical mixing parameterizations, and a bias in winds were among the suggested 
reasons for the persistent biases (Li et al., 2014; Zhu and Zhang, 2018). Moving to CMIP6, a reduction of the 
cold bias in the equatorial cold tongue in the central Pacific is found on average in the CMIP6 models 
(Figure 3.24b; Grose et al., 2020; Planton et al., 2020), however, this reduced bias is not statistically 
significant when considered across the multi-model ensemble (Planton et al., 2020). It is also noteworthy that 
the longitude of the 28°C isotherm is closer to observed in CMIP6 than in CMIP5, with a coincident 
reduction in the CMIP6 inter-model standard deviation (Grose et al., 2020). The latter result implies that 
there is an improvement in the representation of the tropical Pacific mean state in CMIP6 models. 
Comparison of biases in individual HighResMIP models with biases in lower resolution versions of the same 
models indicates that there is no consistent improvement in SST biases in most of the equatorial Pacific with 
resolution (Figure 3.3e; Bock et al., 2020). 
 
#### Tropical Atlantic Ocean 
Fundamental features such as the mean zonal SST gradient in the tropical Atlantic were not reproduced in 
CMIP5 models. Studies have proposed that weaker than observed alongshore winds, underestimation of 
stratocumulus clouds, coarse model resolution, and insufficient oceanic cooling due to a deeper thermocline 
depth and weak vertical velocities at the base of the mixed layer in the eastern basin, underpinned these 
tropical Atlantic SST gradient biases (Hourdin et al., 2015; Richter, 2015). The SST gradient biases still 
remain in CMIP6. On average the cold bias in the western part of the basin is reduced while the warm bias in 
the eastern part has slightly increased (Figure 3.24 b,c) (Richter and Tokinaga, 2020a). Several CMIP6 
models, however, display large reductions in biases of the zonal SST gradient, such that the eastern 
equatorial Atlantic warm SST bias and associated westerly wind biases are mostly eliminated in these 
models (Richter and Tokinaga, 2020a). The high resolution (HighResMIP) CMIP6 models show a better 
representation of the zonal SST gradient (Figure 3.24 b,c), but some lower resolution models also perform 
well suggesting that resolution is not the only factor responsible for biases in Tropical Atlantic SST (Richter 
and Tokinaga, 2020a). 
 
#### Tropical Indian Ocean 
The tropical Indian Ocean mean state is reasonably well simulated both in CMIP5 and CMIP6 (Figure 3.24 
b,c). However, CMIP5 models show a large spread in the thermocline depth, particularly in the equatorial 
part of the basin (Saji et al., 2006; Fathrio et al., 2017a), which has been linked to the parameterization of the 
vertical mixing and the wind structure, leading to a misrepresentation of the ventilation process in some 
models (Schott et al., 2009; Richter, 2015; Shikha and Valsala, 2018). A common problem with the CMIP5 
models is therefore a warm bias in the subsurface, mainly at depths around the thermocline, which is also 
apparent in the CMIP6 models (Figure 3.25g). 
 
In the CMIP6 multi-model mean, the western tropical Indian Ocean shows a slightly larger warm bias 
compared to CMIP5 (Figure 3.24 b,c), which in part could be related to excessive supply of warm water 
from the Red Sea (Grose et al., 2020; Semmler et al., 2020). The HighResMIP models show decreases in 
SST bias across the Indian Ocean with increasing resolution (Figure 3.3e; Bock et al., 2020), though as a 
group the SST biases in the HighResMIP models are no smaller than those of the full CMIP6 ensemble.  
 
In summary, the structure and magnitude of multi-model mean ocean temperature biases have not changed 
substantially between CMIP5 and CMIP6 (medium confidence). Although biases remain in the latest model 
generation models, the broad consistency between the observed and simulated basin-scale ocean properties 
suggests that CMIP5 and CMIP6 models are appropriate tools for investigating ocean temperature and ocean 
heat content responses to forcing. This also provides high confidence in the utility of CMIP-class models for 
detection and attribution studies, for both ocean heat content (Section 3.5.1.3) and thermosteric sea level 
applications (Section 3.5.3). 
 
 
### 3.5.1.3  Ocean Heat Content Change Attribution 

The ocean plays an important role as the Earth’s primary energy store. The AR5 and SROCC assessed that 
the ocean accounted for more than 90% of the Earth’s energy change since the 1970s (Rhein et al., 2013; 
Bindoff et al., 2019). These assessments are consistent with recent studies assessed in Section 7.2 and Cross-
Chapter Box 9.1, which find that 91% of the observed change in Earth’s total energy from 1971 to 2018 was 
stored in the ocean (von Schuckmann et al., 2020). The AR5 concluded that anthropogenic forcing has very 
likely made a substantial contribution to ocean warming above 700 m, whereas below 700 m, limited 
measurements restricted the assessment of ocean heat content changes in AR5 and prevented a robust 
comparison between observations and models (Bindoff et al., 2013). 
 
With the recent increase in ocean sampling by Argo to 2000 m (Roemmich et al., 2015; Riser et al., 2016; 
von Schuckmann et al., 2016) and the resulting improvements in estimates of ocean heat content (Abraham 
et al., 2013; Balmaseda et al., 2013; Durack et al., 2014a; Cheng et al., 2017; von Schuckmann et al., 2020), 
a more quantitative assessment of the global ocean heat content changes that extends into the intermediate 
ocean (700-2000 m) over the more recent period (from 2005 to the present) (Durack et al., 2018) can be 
performed. Observed ocean heat content changes are discussed in Section 2.3.3.1, where it is reported that it 
is virtually certain that the global upper ocean (0-700 m) and very likely that the global intermediate ocean 
(700-2000 m) warmed substantially from 1971 to the present. Further, ocean layer warming contributions are 
reported as 61% (0-700 m), 31% (700-2000 m) and 8% (>2000 m) for the 1971 to 2018 period (Table 2.7). 
CMIP5 model simulations replicate this partitioning fairly well for the industrial-era (1865 to 2017) 
throughout the upper (0-700 m, 65%), intermediate (700-2000 m, 20%) and deep (>2000 m, 15%) layers 
(Gleckler et al., 2016; Durack et al., 2018). The corresponding warming percentages for the multi-model 
mean of a subset of CMIP6 simulations over the 1850-2014 period are 58% for the upper, 21% for the 
intermediate, and 22% for the deep ocean layers (Figure 3.26). These results are consistent with SROCC 
which assessed that it is virtually certain that both the upper and intermediate ocean warmed from 2004 to 
2016, with an increased rate of warming since 1993 (Bindoff et al., 2019). The spatial distribution of these 
changes for different ocean depths is assessed in Section 9.2.2. 
 
<figref>3.26</figref> 
 
The multi-model means of both CMIP5 and CMIP6 historical simulations forced with time varying natural 
and anthropogenic forcing showsrobust increases in ocean heat content in the upper (0-700 m) and 
intermediate (700-2000 m) ocean (high confidence) (Figure 3.26) (Cheng et al., 2016, 2019; Gleckler et al., 
2016; Bilbao et al., 2019; Tokarska et al., 2019). Temporary (<10 years) surface and subsurface cooling 
during and after large volcanic eruptions are also captured in the upper-ocean, and global mean ocean heat 
content (Balmaseda et al., 2013). The ocean heat content increase is also reflected in the corresponding 
ocean thermal expansion which is a leading contributor to global mean sea level rise (Sections 3.5.3.2 and 
9.2.4; Box 9.1). 
 
For the period 1971-2014, the rate of ocean heat uptake for the global ocean in the CMIP6 models is about 
6.43 [2.08-8.66] ZJ yr-1, with the upper, intermediate and deeper layers respectively accounting for 68%, 
16% and 16% of the full depth global heat uptake (Figure 3.26). Overall, the simulated ocean heat content 
changes are consistent with the updated and improved observational analyses, within the very likely 
uncertainty range defined for each (Domingues et al., 2008; Purkey and Johnson, 2010; Levitus et al., 2012; 
Good et al., 2013; Cheng et al., 2017; Ishii et al., 2017; Zanna et al., 2019) (see also Table 2.7, Section 
2.3.3.1) as well as with the ocean components of total Earth heating assessed in Section 7.2.2.2, Table 7.1. 
Nevertheless, large uncertainties remain, particularly in the deeper layers due to the poor temporal and 
spatial sampling coverage, particularly in the Atlantic, Southern and Indian Oceans (Garry et al., 2019). The 
very likely ranges of the simulated trends for the full ocean depth and below 2000 m fall within the very 
likely range of observed uptake during the last two decades. In the intermediate layer, the multi-model 
ensemble mean mostly stays above (below) the observed 5th-95th percentile range before (after) the year 2000.
For the upper ocean, some individual model realisations show a reduced ocean heat content increase 
during the 1970s and 1980s, which is then compensated by a greater warming than the observations from the 
early 1990s. These discrepancies have been linked with a temporary increase in the Southern Ocean deep 
water formation rate, as well as with the models’ strong aerosol cooling effects and high equilibrium climate 
sensitivity (Andrews et al., 2019, 2020; Golaz et al., 2019; Dunne et al., 2020; Winton et al., 2020) (see also 
Section 7.5.6 and Box 7.2). 
 
Nevertheless, both the observed estimates and simulations show that the rate of ocean heat uptake has 
doubled in the past few decades, when contrasted to the rate over the complete 20th century (Figure 3.26), 
with over a third of the accumulated heat stored below 700 m (Cheng et al., 2016, 2019; Gleckler et al., 
2016; Durack et al., 2018). The Southern Ocean shows the strongest ocean heat uptake that penetrates to 
deeper layers (Section 9.2.3.2), whereas ocean heat content increases in the Pacific and Indian Oceans 
largely occur in the upper layers (Bilbao et al., 2019). 
 
Since AR5, the attribution of ocean heat content increases to anthropogenic forcing has been further 
supported by more detection and attribution studies. These studies have shown that contributions from 
natural forcing alone cannot explain the observed changes in ocean heat content in either the upper or 
intermediate ocean layers, and a response to anthropogenic forcing is clearly detectable in ocean heat content 
(Gleckler et al., 2016; Bilbao et al., 2019; Tokarska et al., 2019). Moreover, a response to greenhouse gas 
forcing is detectable independently of the response to other anthropogenic forcings (Bilbao et al., 2019; 
Tokarska et al., 2019), which has offset part of the greenhouse gas induced warming. Further evidence is 
provided by the agreement between observed and simulated changes in global thermal expansion associated 
with the ocean heat content increase when both natural and anthropogenic forcings are included in the 
simulations (Section 3.5.3), though internal variability plays a larger role in driving basin-scale thermosteric 
sea level trends (Bilbao et al., 2015). Over the Southern Ocean, warming is detectable over the late twentieth 
century and is largely attributable to greenhouse gases (Swart et al., 2018; Hobbs et al., 2021), while other 
anthropogenic forcings such as ozone depletion have been shown to mitigate the warming in some of the 
CMIP5 simulations (Swart et al., 2018; Hobbs et al., 2021). The use of the mean temperature above a fixed 
isotherm rather than fixed depth further strengthens a robust detection of the anthropogenic response in the 
upper ocean (Weller et al., 2016), and better accounting for internal variability in the upper ocean (Rathore et 
al., 2020), helps explain reported hemispheric asymmetry in ocean heat content change (Durack et al., 
2014a). 
 
In summary, there is strong evidence for an improved understanding of the observed global ocean heat 
content increase. It is extremely likely that human influence was the main driver of the ocean heat content 
increase observed since the 1970s, which extends into the deeper ocean (very high confidence). Updated 
observations, like model simulations, show that warming extends throughout the entire water column (high 
confidence).  
 
 
## 3.5.2  Ocean Salinity 
 
While ocean assessments have primarily focused on temperature changes, improved observational salinity 
products since the early 2000s have supported more assessment of long-term ocean salinity change and 
variability from AR4 (Bindoff et al., 2007) to AR5 across both models and observations (Flato et al., 2013; 
Rhein et al., 2013). AR5 assessed that it was very likely that anthropogenic forcings have made a discernible 
contribution to surface and subsurface oceanic salinity changes since the 1960s. The SROCC augmented 
these insights, noting that observed high latitude freshening and warming have very likely made the surface 
ocean less dense with a stratification increase of between 2.18% and 2.42% from 1970 to 2017 (Bindoff et 
al., 2019). A recent observational analysis has expanded on these assessments, suggesting a very marked 
summertime density contrast enhancement across the mixed layer base of 6.2% to 11.6% per decade, driven 
by changes in temperature and salinity, which is more than six times larger than previous estimates (Sallée et 
al., 2021). An idealised ocean modelling study suggests that the enhanced stratification can account for a 
third of the salinity enhancement signal since 1990 (Zika et al., 2018). Thus, there has been an expansion of 
observed global- and basin-scale salinity change assessment literature since AR5, with many new studies 
reproducing the key patterns of long-term salinity change reported in AR5 (Rhein et al., 2013), and linking 
these through modelling studies to coincident changes in evaporation-precipitation patterns at the ocean 
surface (Sections 2.3.1, 3.3.2, 8.2.2.1 and 9.2.2). 
 
Unlike SSTs, simulated sea surface salinity (SSS) does not provide a direct feedback to the atmosphere. 
However, some recent work has identified indirect radiative feedbacks through sea-salt aerosol interactions 
(Ayash et al., 2008; Amiri-Farahani et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019b) that can act to strengthen tropical 
cyclones, and increase precipitation (Balaguru et al., 2012, 2016; Grodsky et al., 2012; Reul et al., 2014; 
Jiang et al., 2019). The absence of a direct feedback is one of the primary reasons why salinity simulation is 
difficult to constrain in ocean modelling systems, and why deviations from the observed near-surface salinity 
mean state between models and observations are often apparent (Durack et al., 2012; Shi et al., 2017). 
 
 
### 3.5.2.1  Sea Surface and Depth-profile Salinity Evaluation 
 
When compared to the routine assessment of simulated SST, simulated SSS has not received the same 
research attention at global- to basin-scales. For CMIP3, there was reasonable agreement between the basin-
scale patterns of salinity, with a comparatively fresher Pacific when contrasted to the salty Atlantic, and 
basin salinity maxima features aligning well with the corresponding atmospheric evaporation minus 
precipitation field (Durack et al., 2012). Similar features are also reproduced in CMIP5 along with realistic 
variability in the upper layers, but less variability than observations at 300 m and deeper, especially in the 
poorly sampled Antarctic region (Pierce et al., 2012). In a regional study, only considering the Indian Ocean, 
CMIP5 SSS was assessed and it was shown that model biases were primarily linked to biases in the 
precipitation field, with ocean circulation biases playing a secondary role (Fathrio et al., 2017b). The sea 
surface salinity bias in CMIP6 models is shown in Figure 3.23b.  
 
For the first time in AR5, alongside global zonal mean temperature, global zonal mean salinity bias with 
depth was assessed for the CMIP5 models. This showed a strong upper ocean (<300 m) negative salinity 
(fresh) bias of order 0.3 PSS-78, with a tendency toward a positive salinity (salty) bias (<0.25 PSS-78) in the 
NH intermediate layers (200-3000 m) (Flato et al., 2013). These biases are also present in CMIP6, albeit 
with slightly smaller magnitudes (Figure 3.25). Here we expand the global zonal mean bias assessment to 
consider the three independent ocean basins individually, which allows for an assessment as to which basin 
biases are dominating the global zonal mean. The basin with the most pronounced biases is the Atlantic, with 
a strong upper ocean (<300 m) fresh bias, of order 0.3 PSS-78 just like the global zonal mean, and a marked 
subsurface salinity bias that exceeds 0.5 PSS-78 in equatorial waters between 400–1000 m.  
 
The Pacific Ocean shares the strongest similarity to the global bias, with a similar upper ocean (<300 m) 
fresh bias, of a smaller magnitude than the Atlantic, with a pronounced off-equator feature at intermediate 
depths (500-1500 m). Lower magnitude positive salinity biases (~0.3 PSS-78) are also present in both 
hemispheres between 200-3000 m, and deeper in the SH (Figure 3.25). The Indian Ocean shows similar 
features to the SH Pacific, with a marked upper ocean (<500 m) fresh bias of order 0.3 PSS-78, and a strong 
near-surface positive bias of order 0.4 PSS-78 associated with the Arabian Sea (Figure 3.25). 
 
For the Southern Ocean in CMIP5, considerable fresh biases exist through the water column, and are most 
pronounced in the ventilated layers representing the subtropical mode and intermediate water masses (Sallée 
et al., 2013). A fresh bias in upper and intermediate layers of comparable magnitude is also seen in CMIP6 
(Figure 3.25). The structure of the biases in the CMIP6 multi-model mean (which averages across many 
simulations with differing subsurface geographies and differing Southern Ocean salinity biases (Beadling et 
al., 2020)) is similar to that evident in the CMIP5 multi-model mean, but with slightly smaller magnitudes. 
The Arctic Ocean also on average exhibits a surface-enhanced fresh bias in the upper ocean (Figure 3.25), 
which is much larger than its SH counterpart. 
 
In summary, the structure of the salinity biases in the multi-model mean has not changed substantially 
between CMIP5 and CMIP6 (medium confidence), though there is limited evidence that the magnitude of 
subsurface biases has been reduced. This provides confidence in the utility of CMIP-class models for 
detection and attribution of ocean salinity. 
 
 
### 3.5.2.2  Salinity Change Attribution 
 
AR5  concluded that it was very likely that anthropogenic forcings had made a discernible contribution to 
surface and subsurface ocean salinity changes since the 1960s (Bindoff et al., 2013; Rhein et al., 2013). They 
highlighted that the spatial patterns of salinity trends, and the mean fields of salinity and evaporation minus 
precipitation are all similar, with an enhancement to Atlantic Ocean salinity and freshening in the Pacific and 
Southern Oceans. Since AR5 all subsequent work on assessing observed and modelled salinity changes has 
confirmed these results. 
 
Considerable changes to observed broad- or basin-scale ocean near-surface salinity fields have been reported 
(see Section 2.3.3.2), and these have been linked to changes in the evaporation minus precipitation patterns 
at the ocean surface through model simulations, typically expressing a pattern of change where 
climatological mean fresh regions become fresher and corresponding salty regions becoming saltier (Durack 
et al., 2012, 2013; Zika et al., 2015; Lago et al., 2016; Skliris et al., 2016, 2018; Cheng et al., 2020), also 
broadly present in the CMIP6 multi-model mean (Figure 3.27). At basin-scales, the depth-integrated effect of 
mean salinity changes as captured in halosteric sea level for the top 0 to 2000 m has also been assessed based 
on observational products, and these results mirror near-surface patterns in the CMIP5 and CMIP6 models, 
with most areas that are becoming fresher at the surface exhibiting increases in halosteric sea level, and areas 
becoming saltier exhibiting decreases (Durack et al., 2014b; Figure 3.28). Further investigations using 
observations and models together have tied the long-term patterns of surface and subsurface salinity changes 
to coincident changes to the evaporation minus precipitation field over the ocean (Durack et al., 2012, 2013; 
Durack, 2015; Levang and Schmitt, 2015; Zika et al., 2015, 2018; Grist et al., 2016; Lago et al., 2016; Cheng 
et al., 2020), however the rate of these changes through time continues to be an active area of active research 
(Skliris et al., 2014; Zika et al., 2015, 2018; Cheng et al., 2020; Sallée et al., 2021). 
 
Climate change detection and attribution assessments have considered salinity, with the first of these 
assessed in AR5 (Bindoff et al., 2013). Since this time, the positive detection conclusions (Stott et al., 2008; 
Pierce et al., 2012; Terray et al., 2012) have been supported by a number of more recent and independent 
assessments which have reproduced the multi-decadal basin-scale patterns of change in observations and 
models (Figures 3.27 and 3.28; Durack, 2015; Durack et al., 2014b; Levang and Schmitt, 2015; Skliris et al., 
2016). Observed depth-integrated basin responses, contrasting the Pacific and Atlantic basins (freshening 
Pacific and enhanced salinity Atlantic) were also shown to be replicated in most historical (natural and 
anthropogenically forced) simulations, with this basin contrast absent in CMIP5 and CMIP6 natural-only 
simulations that exclude anthropogenic forcing (Durack et al., 2014b; Figure 3.28). 
 
While observational sparsity considerably limits quantification of regional changes, a recent study by 
Friedman et al. (2017) assessed salinity changes in the Atlantic Ocean from 1896 to 2013 and confirmed the 
pattern of mid-to-low latitude enhanced salinity and high latitude North Atlantic freshening over this period 
exists even after accounting for the effects of the NAO and AMO. 
 
Considering the bulk of evidence, it is extremely likely that human influence has contributed to observed 
near-surface and subsurface salinity changes across the globe since the mid-20th century. All available multi-
decadal assessments have confirmed that the associated pattern of change corresponds to fresh regions 
becoming fresher and salty regions becoming saltier (high confidence). CMIP5 and CMIP6 models are only 
able to reproduce these patterns in simulations that include greenhouse gas increases (medium confidence). 
Changes to the coincident atmospheric water cycle and ocean-atmosphere fluxes (evaporation and 
precipitation) are the primary drivers of the basin-scale observed salinity changes (high confidence). This 
result is supported by all available observational assessments, along with a growing number of climate 
modelling studies targeted at assessing ocean and water cycle changes. The basin-scale changes are 
consistent across models and intensify on centennial scales from the historical period through to the 
projections of future climate (high confidence).

## 3.5.3  Sea Level 
 
In keeping with the scope of this chapter, this section addresses global and basin-scale sea level changes, 
whereas regional and local sea level changes are assessed in Section 9.6. In the AR5, the observed sea level 
budget was closed by considering all contributing factors including ocean warming, mass contributions from 
terrestrial storage, glaciers, and the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets (Church et al., 2013a). The SROCC 
found that the observed global mean sea level (GMSL) rise is consistent within uncertainties with the sum of 
the estimated observed contributions for 1993–2015 and 2006–2015. 
 
 
### 3.5.3.1  Sea Level Evaluation 
 
The current generation of climate models do not fully resolve many of the components required to close the 
observed sea level budget, such as glaciers, ice sheets and land water storage (see Section 9.6 and Box 9.1). 

Consequently, most CMIP-based analyses of sea level change have focused on thermosteric sea level 
changes (i.e., thermal expansion due to warming) and ocean dynamic sea level change, both of which are 
simulated in the CMIP5-generation of models. The improved agreement between modelled thermal 
expansion and observed estimates during the historical period led the SROCC to assess a high confidence 
level in the simulated thermal expansion using climate models and high confidence in their ability to project 
future thermal expansion. 
 
Since CMIP5 models do not include all necessary components of sea level change, this gap has been bridged 
by using offline models (for glacier melt and ice-sheet surface mass balance) driven by reanalyses and model 
output. Some studies have used offline mass inputs to account for dynamic ice sheet and terrestrial 
contributions. Slangen et al. (2017) and Meyssignac et al. (2017) suggested including corrections to several 
contributions to sea level changes including to the Greenland surface mass balance and glacier contributions, 
based on differences between CMIP5-driven model results and reanalysis-driven results. This helps close the 
gap between models and observations for the 20th century globally, as well as providing better agreement 
with tide gauge observations in terms of interannual and multi-decadal variability at the regional scale. 
 
In CMIP6, ice sheets (see Section 3.4.3.2 and 9.4) are included for the first time in ISMIP6 (Nowicki et al., 
2016). There is also scope for new insights into terrestrial water contributions from land surface (and sub-
surface) modelling in the Land Surface, Snow and Soil moisture Model Intercomparison Project (LS3MIP; 
van den Hurk et al., 2016). In parallel, the GlacierMIP project (Hock et al., 2019a; Marzeion et al., 2020; see 
Section 3.4.3.1 and 9.5) is also underway, and has provided more quantitative guidance and a comprehensive 
assessment of the uncertainties and best estimates of the current and future contributions of glaciers to the 
sea level budget.  
 
 
### 3.5.3.2  Sea Level Change Attribution 
 
The SROCC concluded with high confidence that the dominant cause of global mean sea level rise since 
1970 is anthropogenic forcing. Prior to that, the AR5 had concluded that it is very likely that there has been  a 
substantial contribution from anthropogenic forcings to global mean sea level rise since the 1970s. Since the 
AR5, several studies have identified a human contribution to observed sea level change resulting from a 
warming climate as manifest in thermosteric sea level change and the contribution from melting glaciers and 
ice sheets. 
 
For the global mean thermosteric sea level change, Slangen et al. (2014) showed the importance of 
anthropogenic forcings (combined greenhouse gas and aerosol forcings) for explaining the magnitude of the 
observed changes between 1957-2005, considering the full depth of the ocean and natural forcings in order 
to capture the variability (see also Figure 3.29). Over the 1950-2005 period, Marcos and Amores (2014) 
found that human influence explains 87% of the 0-700 m global thermosteric sea level rise. Both 
thermosteric and regional dynamic patterns of sea level change in individual forcing experiments from 
CMIP5 were considered by Slangen et al. (2015) who showed that responses to anthropogenic forcings are 
significantly different from both internal variability and inter-model differences and that although 
greenhouse gas and anthropogenic aerosol forcings produce opposite global mean sea level responses, there 
are differences in response on regional scales. Based on these studies, we conclude that it is very likely that 
anthropogenic forcing was the main driver of the observed global mean thermosteric sea level change since 1970. 
 
In an attribution study of the sea-level contributions of glaciers, Marzeion et al. (2014) found that between 
1991 and 2010, the anthropogenic fraction of global glacier mass loss was 69 ±24% (see also Section 
3.4.3.1). Slangen et al. (2016) considered all quantifiable components of the global mean sea level budget 
and showed that anthropogenically forced changes account for 69 ± 31% of the observed sea level rise over 
the period 1970 to 2005, whereas natural forcings combined with internal variability have a much smaller 
effect - only contributing 9 ± 18% of the change over the same period. These studies indicate that about 70% 
of the combined change in glaciers, ice sheet surface mass balance and thermal expansion since 1970 can be 
attributed to anthropogenic forcing, and that this percentage has increased over the course of the 20th century. 

Detection studies on GMSL change in the 20th century (Becker et al., 2014; Dangendorf et al., 2015) found 
that observed total GMSL change in the 20th century was inconsistent with internal variability. Dangendorf et 
al. (2015) determined that for 1900 to 2011 at least 45% of GMSL change is human-induced. A study that 
developed a semi-empirical model to link sea-level change to observed GMST change concluded that at least 
41% of the 20th century sea-level rise would not have happened in the absence of the century’s increasing 
GMST and that there was a 95% probability that by 1970 GMSL was higher than that which would have 
occurred in the absence of increasing GMST (Kopp et al., 2016). Richter et al. (2020) compared modelled 
sea level change with the satellite altimeter observations from 1993 to 2015; a period short enough that 
internal variability can dominate the spatial pattern of change. They found that when GMSL is not removed, 
model simulated zonally averaged sea level trends are consistent with altimeter observations globally as well 
as in each ocean basin and much larger than might be expected from internal variability. Using spatial 
correlation, Fasullo and Nerem (2018) showed that the satellite altimeter trend pattern is already detectable. 
 
We note that current detection and attribution studies do not yet include all processes that are important for 
sea-level change (see Section 9.6). However, based on the body of literature available, we conclude that the 
main driver of the observed GMSL rise since at least 1970 is very likely anthropogenic forcing.

## 3.5.4  Ocean Circulation 
 
Circulation of the ocean, whether it be wind or density driven, plays a prominent role in the heat and 
freshwater transport of the Earth system (Buckley and Marshall, 2016). Thus, its accurate representation is 
crucial for the realistic representation of water mass properties, and replication of observed changes driven 
by atmosphere-land-ocean coupling. Here, we assess the ability of CMIP models to reproduce the observed 
large-scale ocean circulation, along with assessment of the detection and attribution of any 
anthropogenically-driven changes. We also note that the process-based understanding of these circulation 
changes and circulation changes occurring at smaller scales are assessed in Section 9.2.3. 
 
 
### 3.5.4.1  Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) 
 
The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) represents a large-scale flow of warm salty water 
northward at the surface and a return flow of colder water southward at depth. As such, its mean state plays 
an important role in transporting heat in the climate system, while its variability can act to redistribute heat 
(see Sections 2.3.3.4.1 and 9.2.3.1 for more details). Paleo-climatic and model evidence suggest that changes 
in AMOC strength have played a prominent role in past transitions between warm and cool climatic phases 
(e.g., Dansgaard et al., 1993; Ritz et al., 2013) 
 
AR5 concluded that while climate models suggested that an AMOC slowdown would occur in response to 
anthropogenic forcing, the short direct observational AMOC record precluded it from being used to support 
this model finding. Chapter 2 reports with high confidence, a weakening of the AMOC was observed in the 
mid-2000s to the mid-2010s, while again also noting that the observational record was too short to determine 
whether this is a significant trend or a manifestation of decadal and multi-decadal variability (Section 
2.3.3.4.1). Indirect evidence of AMOC weakening since at least the 1950s is also presented, but confidence 
in this longer-term decrease was low (Section 2.3.3.4.1). 
 
Despite the additional six years or so of observations since the AR5, the evaluation of the AMOC in models 
continues to be severely hampered by the geographically sparse and temporally short observational record. 
The longest continuous observational estimates of the AMOC are based on measurements taken at 26°N by 
the RAPID-MOCHA array (Smeed et al., 2018). Basic evaluation of the AMOC at 26°N shows that the 
CMIP5 and CMIP6 multi-model mean overturning strength is comparable with RAPID (Reintges et al., 
2017; Weijer et al., 2020), but the model range is large (12-29 Sv for CMIP5, Zhang and Wang (2013); and 
10-31 Sv for CMIP6, Weijer et al. (2020)) (Figure 3.30a). It is noted that deviations of AMOC strength in 
CMIP5 models have been related to global-scale sea surface temperature biases (Wang et al., 2014a). Both 
coupled and ocean-only models also underestimate the depth of the AMOC cell (Danabasoglu et al., 2014; 
Weijer et al., 2020; Figure 3.30a). Paleo-climatic evidence has also raised questions regarding the accuracy 
of the representation of the strength and depth of the modelled AMOC during past periods (Otto-Bliesner et 
al., 2007; Muglia and Schmittner, 2015). Overall, however, both the CMIP5 and CMIP6 model ensembles 
simulate the general features of the AMOC mean state reasonably well, but there is a large spread in the 
latitude and depth of the maximum overturning, and the maximum AMOC strength (Figure 3.30a). 
 
The short length of the observed time-series (RAPID has measured the AMOC since 2004), sparse 
observations, observational uncertainties (Sinha et al., 2018), as well as significant observed variability on 
interannual and longer time scales, makes comparison with modelled AMOC variability challenging. RAPID 
observations show that the overturning at 26°N was 2.9 Sv weaker in the multi-year average of 2008-2012 
relative to 2004-2008 and 2.5 Sv weaker in 2012-2017 relative to 2004-2008 (Smeed et al., 2014, 2018) (see 
also Section 2.3.3.4.1). As expected, this weakening was accompanied by a significant reduction in 
northward heat transport (Bryden et al., 2020). CMIP5 and CMIP6 models produce a forced weakening of 
the AMOC over the 2012-2017 period relative to 2004-2008, but at 26°N the multi-model mean response is 
substantially weaker than the observed AMOC decline over the same period. The discrepancy between the 
modelled multi-model mean (i.e. the forced response) and the RAPID observed AMOC changes has led 
studies to suggest that the observed weakening over 2004-2017 is largely due to internal variability (Yan et 
al., 2018). However, comparison of observed RAPID AMOC variability with modelled variability also 
reveals that most CMIP5 models appear to underestimate the interannual and decadal timescale AMOC 
variability (Roberts et al., 2014; Yan et al., 2018), and, although the overall variance is larger in CMIP6  than 
in CMIP5, similar results are found analysing the CMIP6 models (Figure 3.30b,c). It is currently unknown 
why most models underestimate this AMOC variability, or whether they are underestimating the internal or 
externally forced components. This underestimation of AMOC variability may also have potential 
implications for detection and attribution, the relationship between AMOC and AMV (see Section 3.7.7), 
and near-term predictions. There is also emerging evidence, based on analysis of freshwater transports, that 
the AMOC in CMIP5-era models is too stable, largely due to systematic biases in ocean salinity (Liu et al., 
2017a; Mecking et al., 2017). Such a systematic bias may potentially be linked with the underestimation of 
both simulated AMOC internal variability through eddy-mean flow interactions that are poorly represented 
in standard CMIP-class model resolution (Leroux et al., 2018), and externally forced change. 
 
As reported in Section 2.3.3.4.1, estimates of AMOC since at least 1950, which are generated from observed 
surface temperatures or sea surface height, suggest the AMOC weakened through the 20th century (low 
confidence) (Ezer et al., 2013; Caesar et al., 2018). Over the same period, the CMIP5 multi-model mean 
showed no significant net forced response in AMOC (Cheng et al., 2013). However, a significant forced 
change is simulated in the CMIP6 multi-model mean, where a clear increase of the AMOC is seen over the 
1940-1985 period (Menary et al., 2020) (Figure 3.30e). Although there is general agreement that the 
influence of greenhouse gases acts to a weaken the modelled AMOC (Delworth and Dixon, 2006; Caesar et 
al., 2018), changes in solar, volcanic and anthropogenic aerosol emissions can lead to temporary changes in 
AMOC on decadal-to-multidecadal timescales (Delworth and Dixon, 2006; Menary et al., 2013; Menary and 
Scaife, 2014; Swingedouw et al., 2017; Undorf et al., 2018b). As such, the simulated net forced response in 
AMOC is often a balance between the different forcing factors (Delworth and Dixon, 2006; Menary et al., 
2020) (Section 9.2.3.1). The differing AMOC response of CMIP5 and CMIP6 models during the historical 
period has been associated with stronger aerosol effective radiative forcing in the CMIP6 models (Menary et 
al., 2020), such that the aerosol-induced AMOC increase during the 1940-1985 period overcomes the 
greenhouse gas induced decline (Figure 3.30e). However, models simulate a range of anthropogenic aerosol 
effective radiative forcing and a range of historical AMOC trends in CMIP6 (Menary et al., 2020) and there 
remains considerable uncertainty over the realism of the CMIP6 AMOC response during the 20th century 
(Figure 3.30d-f) due to disagreement among the differing lines of evidence. For example, ocean reanalysis 
(Jackson et al., 2019) and forced ocean model simulations (Robson et al., 2012; Danabasoglu et al., 2016), 
which show AMOC changes that are broadly consistent with the CMIP6 response, appear to disagree with 
observational estimates of AMOC over the historical period (Ezer et al., 2013; Caesar et al., 2018). It is 
noted, however, that the relatively short length of the forced ocean simulations and ocean reanalysis 
precludes a comparable assessment of 20th century trends. Furthermore, despite the similar AMOC evolution 
seen in forced ocean model simulations and the CMIP6 models, it is unclear whether the same underlying 
mechanisms are responsible for the changes. 
 
In summary, models do not support robust assessment of the role of anthropogenic forcing in the observed 
AMOC weakening between the mid-2000s and the mid-2010s, which is assessed to have occurred with high 
confidence in Section 2.3.3.4.1, as the changes are outside of the range of modelled AMOC trends 
(regardless of whether they are forced or internally generated) in most models. Thus, we have low confidence 
that anthropogenic forcing has influenced the observed changes in AMOC strength in the post-2004 period. 
In addition to this, there remains considerable uncertainty over the realism of the CMIP6 AMOC response 
during the 20th century due to disagreement among the differing lines of observational and modelled 
evidence (i.e., historical AMOC estimates, ocean reanalysis, forced ocean simulations and historical CMIP6 
simulations). Thus, we have low confidence that anthropogenic forcing has had a significant influence on 
changes in AMOC strength during the 1860-2014 period.

### 3.5.4.2  Southern Ocean Circulation 
 
The Southern Ocean circulation provides the principal connections between the world’s major ocean basins 
through the circulation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), while also largely controlling the 
connection between the deep and upper layers of the global ocean circulation, through its upper and lower 
overturning cells. 
 
The assessment of observations presented in Sections 2.3.3.4.2 and 9.2.3.2 reports that there is no evidence 
of an ACC transport change, and it is unlikely that the mean meridional position of the ACC has moved 
southward in recent decades (Section 2.3.3.4.2 and 9.2.3.2). This is despite observations of surface wind 
displaying an intensification and southward shift (Section 2.4.1.2). There is low confidence in an observed 
intensification of overturning in the Southern Ocean’s upper ocean and there is medium confidence for a 
slowdown of the Antarctic Bottom Water circulation and commensurate Antarctic Bottom Water volume 
decrease since the 1990s (Section 9.2.3.2). Section 9.2.3.2 presents new evidence, since the SROCC, which 
assessed with medium confidence that the lower cell can episodically increase as a response to climatic 
anomalies, temporally counteracting the forced tendency for reduced bottom water formation. 
 
The modelled strength of the ACC clearly improved from CMIP3, in which the models tended to 
underestimate the strength of the ACC, to CMIP5 (Meijers et al., 2012). This improvement in the realism of 
ACC strength continues from CMIP5 to CMIP6, with the modelled ACC strength converging toward the 
magnitude of observed estimates of net flow through the Drake Passage (Beadling et al., 2020). There is, 
however, a small number of models that still display an ACC that is much weaker than that observed, while 
several models also display much more pronounced ACC decadal variability than that observed (Beadling et 
al., 2020). The increased realism of the ACC was at least partly related to noted improvements in all metrics 
of the Southern Ocean’s surface wind stress forcing (Beadling et al., 2020). The most notable wind stress 
forcing improvements were found in the strength and the latitudinal position of the zonally-averaged 
westerly wind stress maximum (Beadling et al., 2020; Bracegirdle et al., 2020a). While the two-cell structure 
of the overturning circulation appears to be well captured by CMIP5 models (Sallée et al., 2013; Russell et 
al., 2018), they tend to underestimate the intensity of the lower cell overturning, and overestimate the 
intensity of the upper cell overturning (Sallée et al., 2013). As the lower overturning cell is closely related to 
Antarctic Bottom Water formation and deep convection, both fields also display substantial errors in CMIP5 
models (Heuzé et al., 2013, 2015). CMIP6 climate models show clear improvements compared to CMIP5 in 
their representation of Antarctic Bottom Water, which suggests an improved representation of the lower 
overturning cell (Heuzé, 2021). 
 
Despite notable improvements of CMIP6 models compared to CMIP5 models, inherent limitations in the 
representation of important processes at play in the Southern Ocean’s horizontal and vertical circulation 
remain (Section 9.2.3.2). For instance, Southern Ocean mesoscale eddies are largely parameterised in the 
current generation of climate models and despite their small spatial scales, they are a key element for 
establishing the ACC and upper overturning cell, as well as for their future evolution under changing 
atmospheric forcing (Kuhlbrodt et al., 2012; Downes and Hogg, 2013; Gent, 2016; Downes et al., 2018; 
Poulsen et al., 2018). The absence of ice-sheet coupling in the CMIP6 model suite is another important 
limitation, as basal meltwater and calving can influence the circulation, particularly the lower cell of the 
Southern Ocean (Bronselaer et al., 2018; Golledge et al., 2019; Lago and England, 2019; Jeong et al., 2020a; 
Moorman et al., 2020). We note that early development of global climate models with interactive ice-shelves 
cavities has begun and is showing potential to be developed (Jeong et al., 2020b). 
 
In summary, while there have been improvements across successive CMIP phases (from CMIP3 to CMIP6) 
in the representation of the Southern Ocean circulation, such that the mean zonal and overturning 
circulations of the Southern Ocean are now broadly reproduced, substantial observational uncertainty and 
climate model challenges preclude attribution of Southern Ocean circulation changes (high confidence). 
 
 
# 3.6  Human Influence on the Biosphere 
 
## 3.6.1  Terrestrial Carbon Cycle 
 
The AR5 did not make attribution statements on changes in global carbon sinks. The IPCC Special Report on 
Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) assessed with high confidence that global vegetation photosynthetic 
activity has increased over the last 2-3 decades (Jia et al., 2019). That increase was attributed to direct land 
use and management changes, as well as to CO2 fertilisation, nitrogen deposition, increased diffuse radiation 
and climate change (high confidence). The AR5 assessed with high confidence that CMIP5 Earth System 
Models (ESMs) simulate the global mean land and ocean carbon sinks within the range of observation-based 
estimates (Flato et al., 2013). The IPCC SRCCL, however, noted the remaining shortcomings of carbon 
cycle schemes in ESMs (Jia et al., 2019), which for example do not properly incorporate thermal responses 
of respiration and photosynthesis, and frequently omit representations of permafrost thaw (Comyn-Platt et 
al., 2018), the nitrogen cycle (Thomas et al., 2015b) and its influence on vegetation dynamics (Jeffers et al., 
2015), the phosphorus cycle (Fleischer et al., 2019), and accurate implications of carbon store changes for a 
range of land use and land management options (Erb et al., 2018; Harper et al., 2018) (see Sections 5.2.1.4.1 
and 5.4, Figure 5.24 and Table 5.4 for details). 
 
This section considers three main large-scale indicators of climate change relevant to the terrestrial carbon 
cycle: atmospheric CO2 concentration, atmosphere-land CO2 fluxes, and leaf area index. These indicators 
were chosen because they have been the target of attribution studies. Other indicators, like land use and 
management, and wildfires, relate to human influence but are discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter 7 discusses 
energetic consequences of changes in the terrestrial carbon cycle in Section 7.4.2.5.2. CMIP5 and CMIP6 
ESMs are most often run with prescribed observed historical changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration and 
diagnose CO2 emissions consistent with these. Such calculations require that the models simulate realistic 
changes in the terrestrial carbon cycle over the historical period, as changes to land carbon stores will 
influence the size of CO2 emissions consistent with prescribed CO2 pathways, and associated remaining 
carbon budgets (Section 5.5). Such testing of existing models is needed while also recognising there are 
process representations still requiring inclusion. 
 
Since the AR5, atmospheric inversion studies have further tested or constrained models, while new datasets 
have been used to constrain specific parts of the terrestrial carbon cycle such as plant respiration 
(Huntingford et al., 2017). Figure 3.31 compares historical emissions-driven CMIP6 simulations of global 
mean atmospheric CO2 concentration and net ocean and land carbon fluxes to the assessed CO2 
concentration and fluxes from the Global Carbon Project (Friedlingstein et al., 2019). For 2014, the CMIP6 
models simulate a range of CO2 concentrations centred around the observed value of 397 ppmv, with a range 
of 381 to 412 ppmv. GSAT anomalies simulated over the historical period are very similar in models that 
simulate or prescribe changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations (Figure 3.31b and Figure 3.4a). Most 
models simulate realistic temporal evolution of the global net ocean and land carbon fluxes, although model 
spread is larger over land (Figure 3.31c,d, see also Sections 3.6.2 and 5.4.5.2, Figure 5.24). Although 
literature published soon after the AR5 highlighted the importance of representing nitrogen limitation on 
plant growth (Peng and Dan, 2015; Thomas et al., 2015b), more recent studies note that models without 
nitrogen limitation can still be consistent with the latest estimates of historical carbon cycle changes (Arora 
et al., 2020; Meyerholt et al., 2020). Uncertainties in the photosynthetic response to atmospheric CO2 
concentrations at global scales, shifts in carbon allocation and turnover, land-use change (Hoffman et al., 
2014; Wieder et al., 2019), and water limitation are also important influences on land carbon fluxes.  
 
All models and observational estimates agree that interannual variability in net CO2 uptake is much larger 
over land than over the ocean. Studies demonstrate that regional variations in both the trends and the yearly 
strength of the terrestrial carbon sink are considerable. Land carbon uptake is dominated by the extratropical 
northern latitudes (Ciais et al., 2019) (see also Section 5.4.5.3 and Figure 5.25) because the tropics may have 
become a net source of carbon (Baccini et al., 2017). At local to regional scales, the dominant driver of 
yearly sink strength variations is water availability, but at continental to global scales, temperature anomalies 
are the dominant driver (Section 5.2.1.4.2; Jung et al., 2017). The major role of levels of water stored in the 
ground in influencing land-atmosphere CO2 exchange has also been confirmed through simultaneous 
analysis of satellite gravimetry and atmospheric CO2 levels (Humphrey et al., 2018). When considered 
globally, simulated land and ocean carbon sinks fall within the range of observation-based estimates with 
high confidence. But there is also high confidence that that apparent success arises for the wrong reasons, as 
models underestimate the NH carbon sink, as discussed in Section 5.4.5.3. 

<figref>3.31</figref>  
 
The seasonal cycle in atmospheric CO2, which is driven by the drawdown of carbon by photosynthesis on 
land during the summer and release by respiration during the winter, has increased in amplitude since the 
start of systematic monitoring (Figure 3.32, see also Section 2.3.4.1). This trend, which is larger at higher 
latitudes of the NH, was first reported by Keeling et al. (1996) and has continued. Changes in vegetation 
productivity have also been observed, as well as longer growing seasons (Park et al., 2016). However, a 
slowdown of the increasing trend has been noted, linked to a slowdown of both vegetation greening and 
growing-season length increases (Buermann et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018b; Wang et al., 2020b). Figure 3.32 
shows that CMIP6 terrestrial carbon cycle models partially capture the increasing amplitude of the seasonal 
cycle of the land carbon sink, also seen in observational reconstructions. However, the identification of the 
human influence that contributes most strongly to these changes in the seasonal cycle is debated.  
 
Proposed causes of the trend in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of CO2, and its amplification at higher 
latitudes, include increases in the summer productivity and/or increases in the magnitude of winter 
respiration of northern ecosystems (Barichivich et al., 2013; Graven et al., 2013a; Forkel et al., 2016; Wenzel 
et al., 2016), increases in productivity throughout the NH by CO2 fertilisation, and increases in the 
productivity of agricultural crops in northern mid-latitudes (Gray et al., 2014; Zeng et al., 2014). Recent 
studies have attempted to quantify the different contributions by comparing atmospheric CO2 observations 
with ensembles of land surface model simulations. Piao et al. (2017) found that CO2 fertilization of 
photosynthesis is the main driver of the increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 
but noted that climate change drives the latitudinal differences in that increase. North of 40°N, Bastos et al. 
(2019) also found CO2 fertilization to be the most likely driver, with warming at northern high latitudes 
contributing a decrease in amplitude, in contrast to earlier conclusions (Graven et al., 2013b; Forkel et al., 
2016), and agricultural and land use changes making only a small contribution. For temperate regions of the 
NH, Wang et al. (2020b) found that the importance of CO2 fertilisation is decreased by drought stress, but 
also found only a small contribution from agricultural and land use changes. However, many global models 
do not include nitrogen fertilisation, changes to crop cultivars or irrigation effects, with the latter associated 
with deficiencies in simulated terrestrial water cycling (Yang et al., 2018a). All these factors influence the 
capability of models to simulate accurately the seasonal cycle in atmosphere-land CO2 exchanges. Model 
comparisons to the atmospheric CO2 concentration record for Barrow, Alaska, suggest that models 
underestimate current levels of carbon fixation (Winkler et al., 2019) and have deficiencies in their 
phenological representation of greenness levels, particularly for autumn (Li et al., 2018c). Based on these 
studies and noting the uncertainty in the processes ultimately driving changes in atmospheric CO2 seasonal 
cycles (Section 5.2.1.4), we assess with medium confidence that fertilisation by anthropogenic increases in 
atmospheric CO2 concentrations is the main driver of the increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of 
atmospheric CO2. 
 
Detection and attribution methods have been applied to leaf area index, which represents “greenness” and 
general photosynthetic productivity (see Section 2.3.4.3). Nitrogen deposition and land cover change trends 
remain small compared to variability, so attributing changes in leaf area index to those processes is difficult. 

Using three satellite products and ten land models, Zhu et al. (2016) found increases in leaf area index 
(greening) over 25-50% of global vegetated areas, and they attributed 70% of this greening to CO2 
fertilisation, although they found that land use change can dominate regionally. This is consistent with the 
attribution study of observed greening of Mao et al. (2016), and with Mao et al. (2013) who found that CO2 
fertilisation was the dominant cause of enhanced vegetation growth, with latitudinal changes in leaf area 
index explained by the larger land surface warming in the NH. These conclusions are also consistent with 
those of Zhu et al. (2017), who found a dominant role for CO2 fertilisation in driving leaf area index changes 
in an attribution study in which land models were first weighted by performance. However, Chen et al. 
(2019) has challenged these results by showing that greening in India and China was driven by land-use 
change.  
 
Leaf area index increases attributed to CO2 fertilisation are due to a direct raised physiological response. 
However, for drylands, CO2-induced stomatal closure may act to conserve soil moisture and thereby 
indirectly drive higher photosynthesis through higher water use efficiency (Lu et al., 2016). In models with 
nitrogen deposition, there is evidence that this simulated effect also influences leaf area index trends, 
however because of a lack of literature based on large-scale land simulations including both nutrient 
limitation and crop intensification, it is not yet possible to make an attribution statement about their 
individual roles in leaf area index changes. 
 
In summary, Earth system models simulate globally averaged land carbon sinks within the range of 
observation-based estimates (high confidence), but global-scale agreement masks large regional 
disagreements. Based on new studies that attribute changes in atmospheric CO2 seasonal cycle to CO2 
fertilisation, albeit counteracted by other factors, combined with the medium confidence that models 
represent the processes driving changes in the seasonal cycle, we assess that there is medium confidence that 
CO2 fertilisation is the main driver of the increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2. 
Based on available literature, CO2 fertilisation has been the main driver of the observed greening trend, but 
there is only low confidence in this assessment because of ongoing debate about the relative roles of CO2 
fertilisation, high latitude warming, and land management, and the low number of models that represent the 
whole suite of processes involved.

## 3.6.2  Ocean Biogeochemical Variables 
 
Since CMIP5, there has been a general increase in ocean horizontal and vertical grid resolution in ocean 
model components (Arora et al., 2020; Séférian et al., 2020). The latter of these developments is particularly 
significant for projections of ocean stressors as it directly affects the representation of stratification. Updates 
in the representation of ocean biogeochemical processes between CMIP5 and CMIP6 have typically 
involved an increase in model complexity. Specific developments have been the more widespread inclusion 
of micronutrients, such as iron, variable stoichiometric ratios, more detailed representation of lower trophic 
levels including bacteria and the cycling and sinking of organic matter. CMIP6 biogeochemical model 
performance is generally an improvement on that of the parent CMIP5 generation of models (Séférian et al., 
2020). The global representation of present-day air-sea carbon fluxes and surface chlorophyll concentrations 
show moderate improvements between CMIP5 and CMIP6. Similar improvements are seen in the 
representation of subsurface oxygen concentrations in most ocean basins, while the representation of surface 
macronutrient concentrations in CMIP6 is shown to have improved with respect to silicic acid but declined 
slightly with respect to nitrate. Model representation of the micronutrient iron has not improved substantially 
since CMIP5, but many more models are capable of representing iron. In addition, a comparison of the 
carbon concentration and carbon climate feedbacks shows no significant change between CMIP5 and CMIP6 
(Arora et al., 2020).  
 
Since AR5, research has also focused on the detection and attribution of regional patterns in ocean 
biogeochemical change relating to interior de-oxygenation, air-sea CO2 flux, and ocean carbon uptake and 
associated acidification. Characterization of flux variability requires understanding of the suite of physical 
and biological processes including transport, heat fluxes, interior ventilation, biological production and gas 
exchange which can have very different controls on seasonal versus interannual timescales in both the North 
Pacific (Ayers and Lozier, 2012) and North Atlantic (Breeden and McKinley, 2016). In the Southern Ocean, 
models have difficulty reproducing the observed seasonal cycle and interannual variability, making 
attribution particularly challenging (Lovenduski et al., 2016; Mongwe et al., 2016, 2018). 
 
The AR5 concluded that oxygen concentrations have decreased in the open ocean since 1960 and such 
decreases can be attributed in part to human influences with medium confidence. The decrease in ocean 
oxygen content in the upper 1000 m, between 1970-2010, is further confirmed in SROCC (medium 
confidence), with the oxygen minimum zone expanding in volume (see also Section 5.3.3.2). Observed 
oxygen declines over the last several decades (Stendardo and Gruber, 2012; Stramma et al., 2012; Schmidtko 
et al., 2017) match model estimates in the surface ocean (Oschlies et al., 2017) but are much larger than 
model derived estimates in the interior (Bopp et al., 2013; Cocco et al., 2013). Some of this difference has 
been interpreted as due to a lack of representation of coastal eutrophication in these models (Breitburg et al., 
2018), but much of it remains unexplained. This disparity is particularly true in the Eastern Pacific oxygen 
minimum zone, where some CMIP5 models showed increasing trends whereas observations show a strong 
decrease (Cabré et al., 2015). However, proxy reconstructions suggest that over the last century the ocean 
may have in fact undergone increases in oxygen in the most oxygen poor regions (Deutsch et al., 2014). As 
discussed in Section 5.3.1 ocean oxygen went through wide oscillations on multi-centennial timescales 
through the last deglaciation, with abrupt warming resulting in loss of oxygen in subsurface waters of the 
North Pacific (Praetorius et al., 2015). The global upper ocean oxygen inventoryis negatively correlated with 
ocean heat content with a regression coefficient comparable to  that found in ocean models (Ito et al., 2017). 
Variability and trends in the observed upper ocean oxygen concentration are mainly driven by the apparent 
oxygen utilization component with small contributions from oxygen solubility, suggesting that changing 
ocean circulation, mixing, and/or biochemical processes, rather than thermally induced solubility effects may 
be the main drivers of observed de-oxygenation. The spatial distribution of the ocean de-oxygenation in the 
interior of the ocean as well as over coastal areas are further assessed in Section 5.3.  
 
As one of the most commonly observed surface parameters, the partial pressure of CO2 has been the topic of 
considerable detection and attribution work. In North Atlantic subtropical and equatorial biomes, warming 
has been shown to be a significant and persistent contributor to the observed increase in the partial pressure 
of CO2 since the mid‐2000s with long‐term warming leading to a reduction in ocean carbon uptake (Fay and 
McKinley, 2013), and with both the partial pressure of CO2 and associated carbon uptake demonstrating 
strong predictability as a function of interannual to decadal climate state (Li et al., 2016a; Li and Ilyina, 
2018). In the Southern Ocean however, detection and attribution of surface trends in the partial pressure of 
CO2 has proven more elusive and dependent on methodology, with some studies suggesting that Southern 
Ocean carbon uptake slowed from about 1990 to 2006 and subsequently strengthened from 2007 to 2010 
(Lovenduski et al., 2008; Fay et al., 2014; Ritter et al., 2017). Other studies have suggested that poor 
representation of the seasonal cycle in the Southern Ocean may confound models’ ability to represent 
changes in the partial pressure of CO2 in the Southern Ocean (Nevison et al., 2016; Mongwe et al., 2018). 
 
Section 5.2.1.3 assesses that both observational reconstructions based on the partial pressure of CO2 and 
ocean biogeochemical models show a quasi-linear increase in the ocean sink of anthropogenic CO2 from 1.0 
± 0.3 PgC yr-1 to 2.5 ± 0.6 PgC yr-1 between 1960–1969 and 2010–2019 in response to global CO2 emissions 
(high confidence). During the 1990s, the global net flux of CO2 into the ocean is estimated to have weakened 
to 0.8 ± 0.5 PgC yr-1 while in 2000 and thereafter, it is estimated to have strengthened considerably to rates 
of 2.0 ± 0.5 PgC yr-1, associated with changes in SST, the surface concentration of dissolved inorganic 
carbon and alkalinity, and decadal variations in atmospheric forcing (Landschützer et al., 2016, see also 
Section 5.2).  
 
Ocean acidification is one of the most detectible metrics of environmental change and was well covered in 
the AR5, in which it was assessed that the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 had very likely resulted in 
acidification of surface waters (Bindoff et al., 2013). Since then, observations and simulations of 
multidecadal trends in surface carbon chemistry have increased in robustness. The evidence on ocean pH 
decline had further strengthened in SROCC with a good agreement found between CMIP5 models and 
observations and an assessment that the ocean was continuing to acidify in response to ongoing carbon 
uptake (Bindoff et al., 2019). An observed decrease in global ocean pH is assessed in Section 2.3.3.5 to be 
virtually certain to have occurred with a rate of 0.003-0.026 decade-1 at the surface for the past 40 years. The 
ocean acidification has occurred not only in the surface layer but also in the interior of the ocean (Sections 
2.3.3.5 and 5.3.3). Rates have been observed to be nearly as high (between −0.015 and −0.020 decade-1) in 
mode and intermediate waters of the North Atlantic through the combined effect of increased anthropogenic 
and remineralized carbon (Ríos et al., 2015) and acidification has been observed down to 3000 m in the deep 
water formation regions (Perez et al., 2018). There has also been considerable improvement in detection and 
attribution of anthropogenic CO2 versus eutrophication based acidification in coastal waters (Wallace et al., 
2014). 
 
The increased evidence in recent studies supports an assessment that it is virtually certain that the uptake of 
anthropogenic CO2 was the main driver of the observed acidification of the global ocean. The observed 
increase in acidification over the North Atlantic subtropical and equatorial regions since 2000 is likely 
associated in part with an increase in ocean temperature, a response which corresponds to the expected 
weakening of the ocean carbon sink with warming. Due to strong internal variability, systematic changes in 
carbon uptake in response to climate warming have not been observed in most other ocean basins at present. 
We further assess, consistent with AR5 and SROCC, that deoxygenation in the upper ocean is due in part to 
anthropogenic forcing, with medium confidence. There is high confidence that Earth system models simulate 
a realistic time evolution of the global mean ocean carbon sink. 
 
 
# 3.7  Human Influence on Modes of Climate Variability 
 
This section assesses model evaluation and attribution of changes in the modes of climate variability listed in 
Cross-Chapter Box 2.2, Table 2. The structure of the modes is described in Annex IV, observed changes in 
the modes and associated teleconnections are assessed in Sections 2.4, and the role of the modes in shaping 
regional climate is assessed in Section 10.1.3.2.  
 
 
## 3.7.1  North Atlantic Oscillation and Northern Annular Mode 
 
The Northern Annular Mode (NAM; also known as Arctic Oscillation) is an oscillation of atmospheric mass 
between the Arctic and northern mid-latitudes, analogous to the Southern Annular Mode (SAM; Section 
3.7.2). It is the leading mode of variability of sea-level pressure in the northern extratropics but also has a 
clear fingerprint through the troposphere up to the lower stratosphere, with maximum expression in boreal 
winter (Kidston et al., 2015). The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) can be interpreted as the regional 
expression of the NAM and captures most of the related variance in the troposphere over a broad North 
Atlantic/Europe domain. Indices measuring the state of the NAO correlate highly with those of the NAM, 
and teleconnection patterns for both modes are rather similar (Feldstein and Franzke, 2006). A detailed 
description of the NAM and the NAO as well as their associated teleconnection over land is given in Annex 
IV.2.1. 
 
AR5 found that while models simulated correctly most of the spatial properties of the NAM, substantial 
inter-model differences remained in the details of the associated teleconnection patterns over land (Flato et 
al., 2013). AR5 reported that most models did not reproduce the observed positive trend of the NAO/NAM 
indices during the second half of the 20th century. It was unclear to what extent this failure reflected model 
shortcomings and/or if the observed trend could be simply related to pronounced internal climate variability. 
AR5 accordingly did not make an attribution assessment for the NAO/NAM. 
 
New studies since the AR5 continue to find that CMIP5 models reproduce the spatial structure and 
magnitude of the NAM reasonably well (Lee and Black, 2013; Zuo et al., 2013; Davini and Cagnazzo, 2014; 
Ying et al., 2014; Ning and Bradley, 2016; Deser et al., 2017b; Gong et al., 2017) although the North Pacific 
SLP anomalies remain generally too strong (Zuo et al., 2013; Gong et al., 2017) and the subtropical North 
Atlantic lobe of SLP anomalies conversely too weak (Ning and Bradley, 2016) in many models. Such overall 
biases noted in both CMIP3 and CMIP5 (Davini and Cagnazzo, 2014) persist in CMIP6 historical 
simulations, even though the multi-model multi-member ensemble mean spatial correlation between 
modelled and observed NAM is slightly higher (Figure 3.33a,d,g). Regarding the NAO, the majority of 
CMIP5 models very successfully simulate its spatial structure (Lee et al., 2019) and its associations with 
extratropical jet, storm track and blocking variations over a broad North-Atlantic/Europe domain (Davini and 
Cagnazzo, 2014) and over land through teleconnections (Volpi et al., 2020). The good performance of the 
models is confirmed in CMIP6 with a marginal improvement of the averaged observation-model spatial 
correlation (Figure 3.33b,e,h) and better skill based on other evaluation metrics (Fasullo et al., 2020). The 
slight underestimation of the SLP anomalies related to the NAO centres of actions over the Azores and 
Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian Seas remain unchanged compared to CMIP5. 
 
CMIP5 models with a model top within the stratosphere seriously underestimate the amplitude of the 
variability of the wintertime NAM expression in the stratosphere, in contrast to CMIP5 models which extend 
well above the stratopause (Lee and Black, 2015). However, even in the latter models, the stratospheric 
NAM events, and their downward influence on the troposphere, are insufficiently persistent (Charlton-Perez 
et al., 2013; Lee and Black, 2015). Increased vertical resolution does not show any significant added value in 
reproducing the structure and magnitude of the tropospheric NAM (Lee and Black, 2013) nor in the NAO 
predictability as assessed in a seasonal prediction context with a multi-model approach (Butler et al., 2016). 
On the other hand, there is mounting evidence that a correct representation of the Quasi Biennal Oscillation, 
extratropical stratospheric dynamics (the polar vortex and sudden stratospheric warmings), and related 
troposphere-stratosphere coupling, as well as their interplay with ENSO, are important for NAO/NAM 
timing (Scaife et al., 2016; Karpechko et al., 2017; Domeisen, 2019; Domeisen et al., 2019), in spite of 
underestimated troposphere-stratosphere coupling found in models compared to observations (O’Reilly et 
al., 2019a).  
 
The observed trend of the NAM and NAO indices is positive in winter when calculated from the 1960s 
(Section 2.4.1.1) but it includes large multidecadal variability, which means that the nature of the trend 
should be interpreted with caution (Gillett et al., 2013). The multi-model multi-member ensemble mean of 
the trend estimated from historical simulations over that period is very close to zero for both CMIP5 and 
CMIP6 (Figure 3.33j,k and Figure 3.34a). Even if one cannot rule out that 1958-2014 was an exceptional 
period of variability, the observational estimates of the wintertime NAO trend lie outside the 5th-95th 
percentile range of the distribution of trends in the CMIP6 historical simulations, and the observed NAM 
trends over the same period lie above the 90th percentile. There is a tendency for the CMIP5 models to 
systematically underestimate the level of multidecadal versus interannual variability of the winter NAO and 
jet stream compared to observations (Wang et al., 2017c; Bracegirdle et al., 2018; Simpson et al., 2018). 
Results from CMIP6 (Figure 3.33j,k) and over the 1958-2019 period (Figure 3.34a) confirm this conclusion 
and seriously questions the ability of the models to simulate long-term fluctuations of the NAO/NAM, 
independently of its forced or internal origins.  

Dedicated SST-forced stand-alone atmospheric model experiments (AMIP) suggest that ocean forcing 
appears to play a role in decadal variability of the NAO and associated fluctuations in the strength of the jet 
(Woollings et al., 2015). In particular, Atlantic and Indian Ocean SST anomalies (Fletcher and Cassou, 2015; 
Baker et al., 2019; Douville et al., 2019; Dhame et al., 2020) may have contributed to the long-term positive 
trend of the winter NAO/NAM over the 20th century, but there is only low confidence in such a causal 
relationship because of the limitation of the imposed SST approach in AMIP and the uncertainties in 
observed SST trends among datasets used as forcing of the atmospheric model. The representation of the 
NAM and NAO spatial structure is slightly improved in AMIP ensembles (Figure 3.33g,h), which also 
produce slightly larger trends than the historical simulations for the NAO, but not for the NAM. 
 
When calculated over the most recent two decades, the wintertime NAM/NAO trend is weakly negative 
since the mid-1990s (Hanna et al., 2015). Recent studies based on observations (Gastineau and Frankignoul, 
2015) and dedicated modelling experiments (Davini et al., 2015; Peings and Magnusdottir, 2016) suggest 
that the recent dominance of negative NAM/NAO could be partly related to the latest shift of the Atlantic 
Multidecadal Variability (AMV) to a warm phase (Sections 2.4.4 and 3.7.7). Some recent modelling studies 
also find that the Arctic sea ice decline might be partly responsible for more recurrent negative NAM/NAO 
(Peings and Magnusdottir, 2013; Kim et al., 2014a; Nakamura et al., 2015), while other studies do not 
robustly identify such responses in models (see also Cross-chapter Box 10.1). 
 
In contrast to winter, the observed trend of the NAO index over 1958-2014 is overall negative in summer 
and is associated with more recurrent blocking conditions over Greenland, in particular since the mid-1990s, 
thus contributing to the acceleration of melting of the Arctic sea ice (Section 3.4.1.1) and Greenland ice sheet 
(Section 3.4.3.2) (Fettweis et al., 2013; Hanna et al., 2015; Ding et al., 2017b). The origin of the negative 
trend of the summer NAO has not been clearly identified, and is hypothesized to be the result of combined 
influences (Lim et al., 2019), though trends in summertime NAO should also be interpreted with caution 
because of the presence of strong multidecadal variability. The recent observed negative NAO prevalence 
and related blocking over Greenland is not present in any of the CMIP5 models (Hanna et al., 2018).  
 
Regarding the influence of external forcings since pre-industrial time, AR5 noted that CMIP5 models tend to 
show an increase in the NAM in response to greenhouse gas increases (Bindoff et al., 2013). Based on the 
CMIP5 historical ensemble, Gillett and Fyfe (2013) however showed that such a trend is not significant in all 
seasons. A multi-model assessment of eight CMIP5 models found a NAM increase in response to 
greenhouse gases, but no robust influence of aerosol changes (Gillett et al., 2013). As for ozone depletion, 
there is no robust detectable influence on long-term trends of the NAO/NAM (Karpechko et al., 2018a) in 
contrast to the SAM (Section 3.7.2), but there are indications that extreme Arctic ozone depletion events and 
their surface expression are linked to an anomalously strong NAM episodes (Calvo et al., 2015; Ivy et al., 
2017). However, the direction of causality here is not clear. 
  
Conclusions on external forcing influences on the NAM are supported by CMIP6 results based on single 
forcing ensembles (Figure 3.34a). Positive trends are found in historical simulations over 1958-2019 in 
boreal winter and are mainly driven by greenhouse gas increases. No significant trends are simulated in 
response to anthropogenic aerosols, stratospheric ozone or natural forcing. Albeit weak and not statistically 
significant, the sign of the multi-model mean forced response due to natural forcing is consistent with the 
observed reduction of solar activity since the 1980s (Section 2.2.1) whose influence would have favoured the 
negative phase of wintertime NAM/NAO based on the fingerprint of the nearly periodical 11-year solar 
cycle extracted from models (Scaife et al., 2013; Andrews et al., 2015; Thiéblemont et al., 2015) or 
observations (Gray et al., 2016; Lüdecke et al., 2020). But such an NAO response to solar forcing remains 
highly uncertain and controversial, being contradicted by longer proxy records over the last millenium 
(Sjolte et al., 2018) and modelling evidence (Gillett and Fyfe, 2013; Chiodo et al., 2019). For all seasons and 
for all individual forcings, uncertainties remain in the estimation of the forced response in the NAM trend as 
evidenced by considerable model spread (Figure 3.34a) and because the simulated forced component has 
small amplitude compared to internal variability.  
 
Despite new effort since AR5 to reconstruct the NAO beyond the instrumental record, it is still very 
challenging to assess the role of external forcings in the apparent multidecadal-to-centennial variability 
present throughout the last millenium. Large uncertainties remain in the reconstructed NAO index that are 
sensitive to the types of proxies and statistical methods (Trouet et al., 2012; Ortega et al., 2015; Anchukaitis 
et al., 2019; Cook et al., 2019; Hernández et al., 2020; Michel et al., 2020) and reconstructed NAO variations 
are often not reproduced using pseudo-proxy approaches in models (Lehner et al., 2012; Landrum et al., 
2013). At low frequency, it remains challenging to evaluate if the observed or reconstructed signal 
corresponds to an actual change in the NAO intraseasonal to interannual intrinsic properties or rather to a 
change in the mean background atmospheric circulation changes projecting on a specific phase of the mode. 
Consequently, conflicting results emerge in the attribution of reconstructed long-term variations in the NAO 
to solar forcing, whose influence thus remains controversial (Gómez-Navarro and Zorita, 2013; Moffa-
Sánchez et al., 2014; Ortega et al., 2015; Ait Brahim et al., 2018; Sjolte et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2018). 
Influences from major volcanic eruptions appear to be more robust (Ortega et al., 2015; Swingedouw et al., 
2017) even if some modelling experiments question the amplitude of the response, which mostly projects on 
the positive phase of the NAM/NAO (Bittner et al., 2016). The forced response is dependent on the strength, 
seasonal timing and location of the eruption but may also depend on the mean climate background state 
(Zanchettin et al., 2013) and/or the phases of the main modes of decadal variability such as the AMV 
(Section 3.7.7) (Ménégoz et al., 2018).  
 
Finally, there is some evidence of an apparent signal-to-noise problem referred to as “paradox” in seasonal 
and decadal hindcasts of the NAO run over 1979-2018 (Scaife and Smith, 2018), which suggests that the 
NAO response to external forcing, SST or sea ice anomalies could be too weak in models. The weakness of 
the signal has been related to troposphere-stratosphere coupling which is too intermittent (O’Reilly et al., 
2019a) and to chronic model biases in the persistence of NAO/NAM daily regimes, which is critically 
underestimated in coupled models (Strommen and Palmer, 2019; Zhang and Kirtman, 2019), and which does 
not exhibit significant improvement when model resolution is increased (Fabiano et al., 2020). Note however 
that the apparent signal-to-noise problem may be dependent on the period analysed over the 20th century, 
which questions its interpretation as a general characteristic of coupled models (Weisheimer et al., 2020).  
 
In summary, CMIP5 and CMIP6 models are skilful in simulating the spatial features and the variance of the 
NAM/NAO and associated teleconnections (high confidence). There is limited evidence for a significant role 
for anthropogenic forcings in driving the observed multidecadal variations of the NAM/NAO from the mid 
20th century. Confidence in attribution is low (i) because there is a large spread in the modelled forced 
responses which is overwhelmed anyway by internal variability, (ii) because of the apparent signal-to-noise 
problem and (iii) because of the chronic inability of models to produce a range of trends which encompasses 
the observed estimates over the last 60 years.

## 3.7.2  Southern Annular Mode 
 
The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) consists of a meridional redistribution of atmospheric mass around 
Antarctica (Figure 3.33c,f), associated with a meridional shift of the jet and surface westerlies over the 
Southern Ocean. SAM indices are variously defined as the difference in zonal-mean sea level pressure or 
geopotential height between middle and high latitudes or via a principal-component analysis (Annex IV.2.2). 
Observational aspects of the SAM are assessed in Section 2.4.1.2. 
 
AR5 assessed that CMIP5 models have medium performance in reproducing the SAM with biases in pattern 
(Flato et al., 2013). It also concluded that the trend of the SAM toward its positive phase in austral summer 
since the mid-20th century is likely to be due in part to stratospheric ozone depletion, and there was medium 
confidence that greenhouse gases have also played a role (Bindoff et al., 2013). Based on proxy 
reconstructions, AR5 found with medium confidence that the positive SAM trend since 1950 was anomalous 
compared to the last 400 years (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013b).  
 
Additional research has shown that CMIP5 models reproduce the spatial structure of the SAM well, but tend 
to overestimate its variability in austral summer at interannual time scales, albeit within the observational 
uncertainty (Zheng et al. 2013; Schenzinger and Osprey 2015; Figure 3.33c,f,i). This is related to the 
models’ tendency to simulate slightly more persistent SAM anomalies in summer compared to reanalyses 
(Schenzinger and Osprey, 2015; Bracegirdle et al., 2020b). This may be due in part to too weak a negative 
feedback from tropospheric planetary waves (Simpson et al., 2013). CMIP6 models show improved 
performance in reproducing the spatial structure and interannual variance of the SAM in summer based on 
Lee et al. (2019) diagnostics (Figure 3.33i), with a better match of its trend with reanalyses over 1979-2014 
(Figure 3.33l), more realistic persistence and improved positioning of the westerly jet, which in CMIP5 
models on average is located too far equatorward (Bracegirdle et al., 2020a; Grose et al., 2020). In CMIP5, it 
is also found that models which extend above the stratopause tend to simulate stronger summertime trends in 
the late 20th century than their counterparts with tops within the stratosphere (Rea et al., 2018a; Son et al., 
2018b), though other differences between these sets of models, such as additional physical processes 
operating in the stratosphere or interactive ozone chemistry, may have also affected these results (Gillett et 
al., 2003a; Sigmond et al., 2008; Rea et al., 2018b). At the surface, Ogawa et al. (2015) demonstrate with an 
atmospheric model the importance of sharp midlatitude SST gradients for stratospheric ozone depletion to 
affect the SAM in summer. These studies imply that the well resolved stratosphere combined with finer 
ocean horizontal resolution has contributed to the stronger simulated trends in CMIP6 than in CMIP5.  
 
CMIP6 historical simulations capture the observed positive trend of summertime SAM when calculated from 
the 1970s to the 2010s (Figure 3.34b). Thomas et al. (2015) found that the chance for the observed 1980-
2004 trend to occur only due to internal variability is less than 10% in many of the CMIP5 models, and 
results from CMIP6 models suggest that the chance of the 1979-2019 trend being due to internal variability 
could be even lower (Figure 3.34b). Although paleo-reconstructions of the SAM index are uncertain and 
vary in terms of long-term trends (Section 2.4.1.2), new reconstructions show that the 60-year summertime 
SAM trend since the mid-20th century is outside the 5th-95th percentile range of the trends in the pre-
industrial variability, which matches the trend range of CMIP5 pre-industrial control simulations well 
(Dätwyler et al., 2018).  
 
In general agreement with AR5, new research continues to indicate that both stratospheric ozone depletion 
and increasing greenhouse gases have contributed to the trend of the SAM during austral summer toward its 
positive phase in recent decades (Solomon and Polvani, 2016), with the ozone depletion influence 
dominating (Gerber and Son, 2014a; Son et al., 2018a). In CMIP6 historical simulations there are significant 
positive SAM trends over the 1979-2019 period in austral summer, although the contribution from ozone 
forcing evaluated with the four available models is not significant (Figure 3.34b). Three of these models 
share the same standard prescribed ozone forcing and produce significantly positive SAM trends over an 
extended period (1957-2019). The fourth model, MRI-ESM2-0, has the option of interactive ozone 
chemistry. Its ozone-only experiment is forced by prescribed ozone derived from its own historical 
simulations and produces a negative SAM trend associated with weak ozone depletion (Morgenstern et al., 
2020). Morgenstern et al. (2014) and Morgenstern et al. (2020) find an indirect influence of greenhouse 
gases on the SAM via induced ozone changes in coupled chemistry-climate simulations, which differ from 
the prescribed ozone simulations shown in Figure 3.34b. Since ~1997, the effective abundance of ozone-
depleting halogen has been decreasing in the stratosphere (WMO, 2018), leading to a stabilization or even a 
reversal of stratospheric ozone depletion (Sections 2.2.5.2 and 6.3.2.2). The ozone stabilisation and slight 
recovery since ~2000 may have caused a pause in the summertime SAM trend (Figure 3.34c; Saggioro and 
Shepherd, 2019; Banerjee et al., 2020), although some influence from internal variability cannot be ruled out. 
While some studies find an anthropogenic aerosol influence on the summertime SAM (Gillett et al., 2013; 
Rotstayn, 2013), recent studies with larger multi-model ensembles find that this effect is not robust (Steptoe 
et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2019), consistent with CMIP6 single forcing ensembles (Figure 3.34). In the CMIP5 
simulations, volcanic stratospheric aerosol has a significant weakening effect on the SAM in autumn and 
winter (Cross-Chapter Box 4.1; Gillett and Fyfe, 2013), but there is no evidence that this effect leads to a 
significant multidecadal trend since the late 20th century. Beyond external forcing, Fogt et al. (2017) show a 
significant association of tropical SST variability with the summertime SAM trend since the mid-20th century 
in agreement with (Lim et al., 2016) who however demonstrate that such a teleconnection between the 
summertime SAM and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (Annex IV.2.3), found in observations, is missing in 
many CMIP5 models. 
 
On longer time scales, last Millennium experiments from CMIP5 models fail to capture multicentennial 
variability evident in the reconstructions for the pre-industrial era (Abram et al., 2014; Dätwyler et al., 2018), 
which is also the case in those from available CMIP6 models (Figure 3.35). However there is large 
uncertainty among reconstructions (Section 2.4.1.2). It is therefore unclear whether this disagreement reflects 
this observational uncertainty, whether forcings such as variations in the imposed insolation may be too 
weak, whether models are insufficiently sensitive to such variations, or whether internal variability including 
that associated with tropical Pacific variability is underrepresented (Abram et al., 2014). The explanation 
could be a combination of all these factors. However, despite the aforementioned limitations of the 
reconstructions, Section 2.4.1.2 assesses that the recent positive trend in the SAM is likely unprecedented in 
at least the past millenium (medium confidence). CMIP5 and CMIP6 last-millennium simulations only 
capture the present anomalous state during in the final decades of the simulations which are dominated by 
human influence; this state is also outside the range of simulated variability characteristic of pre-industrial 
times. 
 
In summary, it is very likely that anthropogenic forcings have contributed to the observed trend of the 
summer SAM toward its positive phase since the 1970s. This assessment is supported by further model 
studies that confirm the human influence on the summertime SAM with improved models since AR5. While 
ozone depletion contributed to the trend from the 1970s to the 1990s (medium confidence), its influence has 
been small since 2000, leading to a weaker summertime SAM trend over 2000-2019 (medium confidence). 
Climate models reproduce the spatial structure of the summertime SAM observed since the late 1970s well 
(high confidence). CMIP6 models reproduce the spatiotemporal features and recent multidecadal trend of the 
summertime SAM better than CMIP5 models (medium confidence). However, there is a large spread in the 
intensity of the SAM response to ozone and greenhouse gas changes in both CMIP5 and CMIP6 models 
(high confidence), which limits the confidence in the assessment of the ozone contribution to the observed 
trends. CMIP5 and CMIP6 models do not capture multicentennial variability of the SAM found in proxy 
reconstructions (low confidence). This confidence level reflects that it is unclear whether this is due to a 
model or an observational shortcoming.

## 3.7.3  El Niño-Southern Oscillation 
 
The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is generated via seasonally modulated interactions 
between the tropical Pacific ocean and atmosphere, influences severe weather, rainfall, river flow and 
agricultural production over large parts of the world (McPhaden et al., 2006). In fact, the remote climate 
influence of ENSO is so large that knowledge of its current phase and forecasts of its future phase largely 
underpin many seasonal rainfall and temperature forecasts worldwide (Annex IV.2.3). 
 
AR5 noted that there have been clear improvements in the simulation of ENSO through previous generations 
of CMIP models (Flato et al., 2013), such that many CMIP5 models displayed behaviour that was 
qualitatively similar to that of the observed ENSO (Guilyardi et al., 2012). However, systematic errors were 
identified in the models’ representation of the Tropical Pacific mean state and aspects of their interannual 
variability that affect quantitative comparisons. The AR5 assessment of ENSO concluded that the 
considerable observed inter-decadal modulations in ENSO amplitude and spatial pattern were largely 
consistent with unforced model simulations. Thus, there was low confidence in the role of a human-induced 
influence in these (Bindoff et al., 2013).  
 
Observed ENSO amplitude, which is measured by the standard deviation of SST anomalies in a central 
equatorial Pacific region often referred to as the Nino 3.4 region, along with the lifecycle of events, are both 
reasonably well reproduced by most CMIP5 and CMIP6 models (Figure 3.36) (Bellenger et al., 2014; 
Planton et al., 2020). The average CMIP5 model ENSO amplitude is slightly lower than that observed, while 
the average CMIP6 model ENSO amplitude is slightly higher than observed (Figure 3.36). The ENSO 
amplitude of the individual models, however, is highly variable across CMIP5 and CMIP6 models with 
many displaying either more or less variability than observed (Stevenson, 2012; Grose et al., 2020; Planton 
et al., 2020). 

<figref>3.36</figref>
 
ENSO events are often synchronized to the seasonal cycle in the observations, as the associated SST 
anomalies tend to peak in boreal winter (November-January) and be at their weakest in the boreal spring 
(March-April) (Harrison and Larkin, 1998; Larkin and Harrison, 2002). The majority of CMIP5 and CMIP6 
models broadly reproduce the seasonality of ENSO SST variability in the central equatorial Pacific 
(Taschetto et al., 2014a; Abellán et al., 2017; Grose et al., 2020; Planton et al., 2020) (Figure 3.37). 
However, CMIP5 models, while displaying an improvement on CMIP3 models, appear to underrepresent the 
magnitude of the seasonal variance modulation (Bellenger et al., 2014). This under-representation of 
seasonal variance modulation continues in CMIP6 models, which display no statistically significant 
difference in this behaviour when compared to CMIP5 models (Planton et al., 2020) (Figure 3.37). 
 
<figref>3.37</figref> 
 
Observations show strong multi-decadal modulation of ENSO variance throughout the 20th century, with the 
most recent period displaying larger variability while the mid-century displayed relatively low ENSO 
variability (e.g., Li et al., 2013; McGregor et al., 2013; Hope et al., 2017; Figure 2.36). As assessed in 
Section 2.4.2, ENSO amplitude since 1950 is higher than over the pre-industrial period from 1850 as far 
back as 1400 (medium confidence), but there is low confidence that it is higher than the variability over 
periods prior to 1400. This reported variance increase suggests that external forcing plays a role in the ENSO 
variance changes (Hope et al., 2017b). However, large ensembles of single model or multiple model 
simulations do not find strong trends in ENSO variability over the historical period, suggesting that external 
forcing has not yet modulated ENSO variability with a magnitude that exceeds the range of internal 
variability (Hope et al., 2017b; Stevenson et al., 2017; Maher et al., 2018b). This is consistent with the 
Chapter 2 assessment, that there is no clear evidence for a recent sustained shift in ENSO beyond the range 
of variability on decadal to millennial timescales (Section 2.4.2). CMIP5 and CMIP6 models show a 
decrease in ENSO variance in the mid-Holocene (Brown et al., 2020), though not to the extent seen in paleo-
proxy records (Emile-Geay et al., 2016). This suggests that both modelled and observed ENSO respond to 
changes in external forcing, but not necessarily in the same manner. 
 
Most CMIP5 and CMIP6 models are found to represent the general structure of observed SST anomalies 
during ENSO events well (Kim and Yu, 2012; Taschetto et al., 2014b; Brown et al., 2020; Grose et al., 
2020). However, the majority of CMIP5 models display SST anomalies that: i) extend too far to the west 
(Taschetto et al., 2014b; Capotondi et al., 2015); and ii) have meridional widths that are too narrow (Zhang 
and Jin, 2012) compared to the observations. CMIP6 models display a statistically significant improvement 
in the longitudinal representation of ENSO SST anomalies relative to CMIP5 models (Planton et al., 2020), 
however, systematic biases in the zonal extent and meridional width remain in CMIP6 models (Fasullo et al., 
2020; Planton et al., 2020). The ENSO phase asymmetry, where observed strong El Niño events are larger 
and have a shorter duration than strong La Niña events (Ohba and Ueda, 2009; Frauen and Dommenget, 
2010), is also underrepresented in both CMIP5 and CMIP6 models (Zhang and Sun, 2014; Planton et al., 
2020). In this instance, both CMIP5 and CMIP6 models typically display El Niño events that have a longer 
duration than those observed, La Niña events that have a similar duration to those observed, and there is very 
little asymmetry in the duration of El Niño and La Niña phases (Figure 3.36). Roberts et al. (2018) find an 
improvement in amplitude asymmetry in a HighResMIP model, but the underrepresentation remains. 
 
The continuum of El Niño events are typically stratified into two types (often termed “flavours”), Central 
Pacific and East Pacific, where the name denotes the location of the events’ largest SST anomalies (Annex 
IV.2.3; Capotondi et al., 2015). As discussed in Section 2.4.2, the different types of events tend to produce 
distinct teleconnections and climatic impacts (e.g., Taschetto et al., 2020). The characteristics of El Niño 
events of these two flavours in CMIP5 were generally comparable to the observations (Taschetto et al., 
2014b). CMIP6 models, however, display a statistically significant improvement in the representation of this 
ENSO event-to-event SST anomaly diversity when compared with CMIP5 models (Planton et al., 2020). In 
addition to this ENSO event diversity, the short observational record also displays an increase in the number 
of the Central Pacific-type events in recent decades (Ashok et al., 2007; McPhaden et al., 2011), which has 
also been identified as unusual in the context of the last 500-800 years based on recent paleo-climatic 
reconstructions (Section 2.4.2; Liu et al., 2017; Freund et al., 2019). However, the short observational record 
combined with observational (L’Heureux et al., 2013) and paleo-climatic reconstruction uncertainties 
preclude firm conclusions being made about the long-term changes in the occurrence of different El Niño 
event types. Initial analysis with a selected number of CMIP3 models suggested that there may be a forced 
component to this recent prominence of Central Pacific-type events (Yeh et al., 2009), but analysis since 
then suggests that this behaviour is i) consistent with that expected from internal variability (Newman et al., 
2011); and ii) not apparent across the full CMIP5 ensemble of historical simulations (Taschetto et al., 
2014b). Analysis of single-model large ensembles suggests that changes to ENSO event type in response to 
historical radiative forcing are not significant (e.g., Stevenson et al., 2017). These same results, however, 
also suggest that multiple forcings can have significant influences on ENSO type and that the net response 
will depend on the accurate representation of the balance of these forcings (Stevenson et al., 2017). 
 
The climatic effects of ENSO outside the tropical Pacific largely arise through atmospheric teleconnections 
that are induced by ENSO-driven changes in deep tropical atmospheric convection and heating (Yeh et al., 
2018). The teleconnections to higher latitudes are forced by waves that propagate into the extratropics 
(Hoskins and Karoly, 1981) and respectively excite the Pacific-North American pattern (Horel and Wallace, 
1981) and Pacific-South American pattern (Karoly, 1989; Irving and Simmonds, 2016) in the Northern and 
Southern Hemispheres. Given the influence of these teleconnections on climate and extremes around the 
globe, it is important to understand how well they are reproduced in CMIP models. What has also become 
clear is that spatial correlations of ENSO’s teleconnections calculated over relatively short periods (< 100 
years) may not be the most effective way to assess these relationships (Langenbrunner and Neelin, 2013; 
Perry et al., 2019). This is because the spatial patterns are significantly affected by internal atmospheric 
variability on relatively short time scales (< 100 years) (Batehup et al., 2015; Perry et al., 2019). However, 
looking at simplified metrics like the agreement in the sign of the teleconnections (Langenbrunner and 
Neelin, 2013), regional average teleconnection strength over land (Perry et al., 2019), or a combination of 
both (Power and Delage, 2018a) provides a more robust depiction of the teleconnection representation. 
Examining sign agreement for the teleconnection patterns, ensembles of CMIP5 AMIP simulations display 
broad spatial regions with high sign agreement with the observations, suggesting that the model ensemble is 
producing useful information regarding the teleconnected precipitation signal (Langenbrunner and Neelin, 
2013). Looking at regional averages of CMIP5 historical simulations, Power and Delage (2018) show that 
the average coupled model teleconnection pattern reproduces the sign of the observed teleconnections in the 
majority of the 25 regions analysed. The sign agreement between the observed teleconnection and the multi-
model mean teleconnection remains strong in CMIP6 (18 out of 20 displayed regions) (Figure 3.38), and the 
observed DJF teleconnection strength falls within the modelled range in all of the displayed regions for 
temperature and precipitation. It is noted, however, that while there is broad agreement in ENSO 
teleconnections between CMIP6 models and observations during DJF (e.g., Fasullo et al., 2020), there are 
regions and seasons where the modelled teleconnection strength is outside the observed range (Chen et al., 
2020). 
 
<figref>3.38</figref> 
 
Most CMIP5 and CMIP6 models exhibit ENSO behaviour during the historical period that, to first order, is 
qualitatively similar to that of the observed ENSO. Many studies are now delving deeper into the models to 
understand if they are accurately producing the dynamics driving ENSO and its initiation (Jin et al., 2006; 
Bellenger et al., 2014; Vijayeta and Dommenget, 2017a; Bayr et al., 2019; Planton et al., 2020). For both 
CMIP3 and CMIP5, diagnostics of ENSO event growth appear to show that the models, while producing 
ENSO variability that is qualitatively similar to that observed, do not represent the balance of the underlying 
dynamics well. The atmospheric Bjerknes feedback is too weak in the majority of models, while the surface 
heat flux feedback is also too weak in the majority of models. The former restricts event growth, while the 
latter restricts event damping, which when combined allow most models to produce variability in a range 
that is consistent with the observations (Bellenger et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2014b; Vijayeta and Dommenget, 
2017b; Bayr et al., 2019). Analysis of ENSO representation in a subset of CMIP6 models by Planton et al. 
(2020) suggests that these issues remain.  
 
To conclude, ENSO representation in CMIP5 models displayed a significant improvement from the 
representation of ENSO variability in CMIP3 models, which displayed much more intermodel spread in 
standard deviation, and stronger biennial periodicity (Guilyardi et al., 2012; Flato et al., 2013). In general, 
there has been no large step change in the representation of ENSO between CMIP5 and CMIP6, however, 
CMIP6 models appear to better represent some key ENSO characteristics (e.g., Brown et al., 2020; Planton 
et al., 2020). The instrumental record and paleo-proxy evidence through the Holocene all suggest that ENSO 
can display considerable modulations in amplitude, pattern and period (see also Section 2.4.2). For the 
period since 1850, there is also no clear evidence for a sustained shift in ENSO beyond the range of internal 
variability (Section 2.4.2). However, paleo-proxy evidence indicates with medium confidence that ENSO 
variability since 1950 is greater than at any time between 1400 and 1850 (Section 2.4.2). Coupled models 
display large changes of ENSO behaviour in the absence of external forcing changes, and little-to-no 
variance sensitivity to historical anthropogenic forcing. Thus, there is low confidence that anthropogenic 
forcing has led to the changes of ENSO variability inferred from paleo-proxy evidence.  
 
Chapter 2 reports low confidence that the apparent change from East Pacific- to Central Pacific-type El Niño 
events that occurred in the last 20-30 years was representative of a long term change. While some climate 
models do suggest external forcing may affect the El Niño event type, most climate models suggest that what 
has been observed is well within the range of natural variability. Thus, there is low confidence that 
anthropogenic forcing has had an influence on the observed changes in El Niño event type.  
 
 
## 3.7.4 Indian Ocean Basin and Dipole Modes
 
The Indian Ocean Basin (IOB) and Dipole (IOD) modes are the two leading modes of interannual SST 
variability over the tropical Indian Ocean, featuring basin-wide warming/cooling and an east-west dipole of 
SST anomalies, respectively (Annex IV.2.4). The IOD mode is anchored to boreal summer to autumn by the 
air-sea feedback, and often develops in concert with ENSO. Driven by matured ENSO events, the IOB mode 
peaks in boreal spring and often persists into the subsequent summer. Similar patterns of Indian Ocean SST 
variability also dominate its decadal and longer time scale variability (Han et al., 2014b). 
 
AR5 concluded that models show high and medium performance in reproducing the IOB and IOD modes, 
respectively (medium confidence), with difficulty in reproducing the persistence of the IOB and the pattern 
and magnitude of the IOD (Flato et al., 2013). There was low confidence that changes in the IOD were 
detectable or attributable to human influence (Bindoff et al., 2013).  
 
Since the AR5, CMIP5 model representation of these modes has been analysed in detail, finding that most of 
the models qualitatively reproduce the spatial and seasonal features of the IOB and IOD modes (Chu et al., 
2014; Liu et al., 2014; Tao et al., 2016b). Improvements in simulating the IOB mode since CMIP3 have been 
identified in reduced multi-model mean bias and inter-model spread (Tao et al., 2016b). CMIP5 models 
overall capture the transition from the IOD to IOB modes during an ENSO event (Tao et al., 2016b). The 
IOB mode is forced in part through a cross-equatorial wind-evaporation-SST feedback triggered by ENSO-
forced anomalous ocean Rossby waves that propagate to the shallow climatological thermocline dome in the 
tropical southwestern Indian Ocean (Du et al., 2009). Consistently, models with a deeper climatological 
thermocline dome produce a weaker and less persistent IOB mode (Li et al., 2015b; Zheng et al., 2016). The 
deep thermocline bias remains in the ensemble mean of CMIP5 models due to a common surface easterly 
wind bias over the equatorial Indian Ocean (Lee et al., 2013) associated with weaker South Asian summer 
monsoon circulation (Li et al., 2015c). However, the influence of this systematic bias may be compensated 
by other biases, resulting in a realistic IOB magnitude (Tao et al., 2016b). Halder et al. (2020) found that 
CMIP6 models reproduce the IOB mode reasonably well, but did not evaluate the progress since CMIP5. 
 
By contrast, the IOD magnitude is overestimated by CMIP5 models on average, though with noticeable 
improvements from CMIP3 models (Liu et al., 2014). The overestimation of the IOD magnitude remains in 
most of 34 CMIP6 models examined in McKenna et al. (2020) with worsening on average in July and 
August. A too steep climatological thermocline slope along the equator due to the surface easterly wind bias 
in boreal summer and autumn contributes to this IOD magnitude bias through an excessively strong Bjerknes 
feedback in CMIP5 (Liu et al., 2014; Li et al., 2015c; Hirons and Turner, 2018). The surface easterly bias 
and associated east-west SST gradient bias are not improved in CMIP6 (Long et al., 2020), suggesting that 
the thermocline bias also remains. McKenna et al. (2020) additionally find degradation in the positive-
negative asymmetry of the IOD but an improvement in IOD frequency in a subset of CMIP6 models 
compared to CMIP5. In terms of teleconnections, the equatorial surface easterly wind bias also affects the 
IOD-associated moisture transport anomalies toward tropical eastern Africa (Hirons and Turner, 2018) 
where the IOD is associated with strong precipitation anomalies in boreal autumn (Annex IV.2.4). CMIP5 
and CMIP6 models capture the IOD teleconnection to Southern and Central Australian precipitation 
although it is weaker on average than observed, with no clear improvements from CMIP5 to CMIP6 (Grose 
et al., 2020). Strong IOD events could also influence the NH extratropical circulation in winter and in 
particular the NAM (Section 3.7.1), based on interference between forced Rossby waves emerging from the 
Indian Ocean and climatological stationary waves (Fletcher and Cassou, 2015). The record positive phase of 
the NAO/NAM in winter 2019-2020 assessed over the instrumental era has been accordingly linked to the 
record IOD event of autumn 2019 (Hardiman et al., 2020), which has been associated with the devastating 
record fire season in Australia (Wang and Cai, 2020).  
 
The observed Indian Ocean basin-average SST increase on multidecadal and centennial time scales is well 
represented by CMIP5 historical simulations, and has been attributed to the effects of greenhouse gases 
offset in part by the effects of anthropogenic aerosols mainly through aerosol-cloud interactions (Dong and 
Zhou, 2014; Dong et al., 2014b). The observed SST trend is larger in the western than eastern tropical Indian 
Ocean, which leads to an apparent upward trend of the IOD index, but this trend is statistically insignificant 
(Section 2.4.3). CMIP5 models capture this warming pattern, which may be associated with Walker 
circulation weakening over the Indian Ocean due to greenhouse gas forcing (Dong and Zhou, 2014). 
However, strong internal decadal IOD-like variability and observational uncertainty preclude attribution (Cai 
et al., 2013; Han et al., 2014c; Gopika et al., 2020). Such a positive IOD-like change in equatorial zonal SST 
gradient suggests an increase in the frequency of extreme positive events (Cai et al., 2014) and skewness 
(Cowan et al., 2015) of the IOD mode. While there is some evidence of an increase in frequency of positive 
IOD events during the second half of the 20th century, the current level of IOD variability is not 
unprecedented in a proxy reconstruction for the last millenium (Section 2.4.3, Abram et al., 2020). Besides, 
the IOD magnitude in the late 20th century is not significantly different between CMIP5 simulations forced 
by historical and natural-only forcings, though this conclusion is based on only five selected ensemble 
members that realistically reproduce statistical features of the IOD (Blau and Ha, 2020). While selected 
CMIP5 models show weakening (Thielke and Mölg, 2019) and seasonality changes (Blau and Ha, 2020) in 
IOD-induced rainfall anomalies in tropical eastern Africa, no comparison with observational records has 
been made. Likewise, while a strengthening tendency of the ENSO-IOB mode correlation and resultant 
intensification of the IOB mode are found in historical or future simulations in selected CMIP5 models (Hu 
et al., 2014; Tao et al., 2015), such a change has not been detected in observational records. 
 
After linear detrending, Pacific decadal variability (PDV; Annex IV.2.6; Section 3.7.6) has been suggested 
as a driver of decadal-to-multidecadal variations in the IOB mode (Dong et al., 2016). However, correlation 
between the PDV and a decadal IOB index, defined from linearly detrended SST, changed from positive to 
negative during the 1980s (Han et al., 2014a). The increase in anthropogenic forcing and recovery from the 
eruptions of El Chichón in 1982 and Pinatubo in 1991 may have overwhelmed the PDV influence, and 
explain this change (Dong and McPhaden, 2017; Zhang et al., 2018a). However, the low statistical degrees 
of freedom hamper clear detection of human influence in this correlation change. 
 
To summarize, there is medium confidence that changes in the interannual IOD variability in the late 20th 
century inferred from observations and proxy records are within the range of internal variability. There is no 
evidence of anthropogenic influence on the interannual IOB. On decadal-to-multidecadal time scales, there is 
low confidence that human influence has caused a reversal of the correlation between PDV and decadal 
variations in the IOB mode. The low confidence in this assessment is due to the short observational record, 
limited number of models used for the attribution, lack of model evaluation of the decadal IOB mode, and 
uncertainty in the contribution from volcanic aerosols. Nevertheless, CMIP5 models have medium overall 
performance in reproducing both the interannual IOB and IOD modes, with an apparently good performance 
in reproducing the IOB magnitude arising from compensation of biases in the formation process, and overly 
high IOD magnitude due to the mean state bias (high confidence). There is no clear improvement in the 
simulation of the IOD from CMIP5 to CMIP6 models, though there is only medium confidence in this 
assessment, since only a subset of CMIP6 models have been examined. There is no evidence for 
performance changes in simulating the IOB from CMIP5 to CMIP6 models. 
 
 
## 3.7.5  Atlantic Meridional and Zonal Modes 
 
The Atlantic Zonal Mode (AZM), often referred to as the Atlantic Equatorial Mode or Atlantic Niño, and the 
Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM) are the two leading basin wide patterns of interannual-to-decadal 
variability in the tropical Atlantic. Akin to ENSO in the Pacific, the term Atlantic Niño is broadly used to 
refer to years when the SSTs in the tropical eastern Atlantic basin along the cold tongue are significantly 
warmer than the climatological average. The AMM is characterized by anomalous cross-equatorial gradients 
in SST. Both modes are associated with altered strength of the ITCZ and/or latitudinal shifts in the ITCZ, 
which locally affect African and American monsoon systems and remotely affect Tropical Pacific and Indian 
Ocean variability through inter-basins teleconnections. A detailed description of both AZM and AMM, as 
well as their associated teleconnection over land, is given in Annex IV.2.5 
 
AR5 mentioned the considerable difficulty in simulating both Atlantic Niño and AMM despite some 
improvements in CMIP5 for some models (Flato et al., 2013). Severe biases in mean state and variance for 
both SST and atmospheric dynamics including rainfall (e.g. a double ITCZ) as well as teleconnections were 
reported. AR5 highlighted the complexity of the Tropical Atlantic biases, which were explained by multiple 
factors both in the ocean and atmosphere. 
 
Since AR5, further analysis of the major persistent biases in models has been reported (Xu et al., 2014; 
Jouanno et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017b; Dippe et al., 2018; Lübbecke et al., 2018; Voldoire et al., 2019a). 
Errors in equatorial and basin wide trade winds, cloud cover and ocean vertical mixing and dynamics both 
locally and in remote subtropical upwelling regions, key thermodynamic ocean-atmosphere feedbacks, and 
tropical land-atmosphere interaction have been shown to be detrimental to the representation of both the 
Atlantic Niño and AMM leading to poor teleconnectivity over land (Rodríguez-Fonseca et al., 2015; 
Wainwright et al., 2019) and between tropical basins (Ott et al., 2015).  
 
Despite some improvements (Richter et al., 2014; Nnamchi et al., 2015), biases in the mean state are so large 
that the mean east-west temperature gradient at the equator along the thermocline remains opposite to 
observed in two thirds of the CMIP5 models (Section 3.5.1.2), which clearly affects the simulation of the 
Atlantic Niño and associated dynamics (Muñoz et al., 2012; Ding et al., 2015; Deppenmeier et al., 2016). 
The interhemispheric SST gradient is also systematically underestimated in models with a too cold mean 
state in the northern part of the Tropical Atlantic ocean and too warm conditions in the Southern Atlantic 
basin. The seasonality is poorly reproduced and the wind-SST coupling is weaker than observed so that 
altogether, and despite AMM-like variability in 20th century climate simulations, AMM is not the dominant 
Atlantic mode in all CMIP5 models (Liu et al., 2013; Amaya et al., 2017). These biases in mean state 
translate into biases in modelling the mean ITCZ (Flato et al., 2013). Similar biases were found in 
experiments using CMIP5 models but with different climate background states, such as Last Glacial 
Maximum, Mid-Holocene and future scenario simulations (Brierley and Wainer, 2018)⁠. Analyses from 
CMIP6 show encouraging results in the representation of Atlantic Niño and AMM modes of variability in 
terms of amplitude and seasonality. Some models now display reduced biases in the spatial structure of the 
modes and related explained variance but persistent errors still remain on average in the timing of the modes 
and in the coupled nature of the modes, i.e. the strength of the link between ocean (SST, mixed layer depth) 
and atmospheric (wind) anomalies (Richter and Tokinaga, 2020b), as well as in the Indian Ocean equatorial 
east-west temperature gradient (Section 3.5.1.2, Figure 3.24).  
 
There are some recent indications that increasing model resolution both vertically and horizontally, in the 
ocean and atmospheric component (Richter, 2015; Small et al., 2015; Harlaß et al., 2018), could partly 
alleviate some tropical Atlantic biases in mean state (Section 3.5.1.2), seasonality, interannual-to-decadal 
variability and associated teleconnectivity over land, such as with the West African monsoon (Steinig et al., 
2018). Results from CMIP6 tend to confirm that increasing resolution is not the unique way to address the 
biases in the Tropical Atlantic (Richter and Tokinaga, 2020b). For instance, the inclusion of a stochastic 
physics scheme has a nearly equivalent effect in the improvement of the mean number and the strength 
distribution of tropical Atlantic cyclones (Vidale et al., 2021). 
 
Section 2.4.4 assess that there is low confidence in any sustained changes to the AZM and AMM variability 
in instrumental observations. Moreover any attribution of possible human influence on the Atlantic Modes 
and associated teleconnections is limited by the poor fidelity of CMIP5 and CMIP6 models in reproducing 
the mean tropical Atlantic climate, its seasonality and variability, despite hints of some improvement in 
CMIP6, as well as other sources of uncertainties related to limited process understanding in the observations 
(Foltz et al., 2019), the response of the tropical Atlantic climate to anthropogenic aerosol forcing (Booth et 
al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013a) and the presence of strong multidecadal fluctuations related to AMV (Section 
3.7.7) and cross-tropical basin interactions (Martín-Rey et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2019). The fact that most 
models poorly represent the climatology and variability of the tropical Atlantic combined with the short 
observational record makes it difficult to place the recent observed changes in the context of internal multi-
annual variability versus anthropogenic forcing.  
 
In summary, based on CMIP5 and CMIP6 results, there is no robust evidence that the observed changes in 
either the Atlantic Niño or AMM modes and associated teleconnections over the second half of the 20th 
century are beyond the range of internal variability or have been influenced by natural or anthropogenic 
forcing. Considering the physical processes responsible for model biases in these modes, increasing 
resolution in both ocean and atmosphere components may be an opportunity for progress in the simulation of 
the tropical Atlantic changes as evidenced by some individual model studies (Roberts et al., 2018), but this 
needs confirmation from a multi-model perspective.  
 
 
## 3.7.6  Pacific Decadal Variability 
 
Pacific decadal variability (PDV) is the generic term for the modes of variability in the Pacific Ocean that 
vary on decadal to interdecadal timescales. PDV and its related teleconnections encompass the Pacific 
Decadal Oscillation (PDO; Mantua et al. 1997; Mantua and Hare 2002; Zhang et al. 1997), and an 
anomalous SST pattern in the North Pacific, as well as a broader structure associated with Pacific-wide SSTs 
termed the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO; Power et al. 1999; Folland et al. 2002; Henley et al. 2015). 
Since the PDO and IPO indices are highly correlated, this section assesses them together as the PDV (Annex 
IV.2.6). 
 
AR5 mentioned an overall limited level of evidence for both CMIP3 and CMIP5 evaluation of the Pacific 
modes at interdecadal timescales, leading to low confidence statements about the models’ performance in 
reproducing PDV (Flato et al., 2013) and similarly low confidence in the attribution of observed PDV 
changes to human influence (Bindoff et al., 2013). 
 
The implication of PDV in the observed slowdown of the GMST warming rate in the early 2000s (Cross-
Chapter Box 3.1) has triggered considerable research on decadal climate variability and predictability since 
the AR5 (Meehl et al., 2013, 2016b; England et al., 2014; Dai et al., 2015; Steinman et al., 2015; Kosaka and 
Xie, 2016; Cassou et al., 2018). Many studies find that the broad spatial characteristics of PDV are 
reasonably well represented in unforced climate models (Henley 2017; Newman et al. 2016) and in historical 
simulations in CMIP5 and CMIP6 (Figure 3.39), although there is sensitivity to methodology used to remove 
the externally-forced component of the SST (Bonfils and Santer, 2011; Xu and Hu, 2018). Compared with 
CMIP3 models, CMIP5 models exhibit overall slightly better performance in reproducing PDV and 
associated teleconnections (Polade et al., 2013; Joshi and Kucharski, 2017), and also smaller inter-model 
spread (Lyu et al., 2016). CMIP6 models on average show slightly improved reproduction of the PDV spatial 
structure than CMIP5 models (Figure 3.39a-c; Fasullo et al., 2020). SST anomalies in the subtropical South 
Pacific lobe are however too weak relative to the equatorial and North Pacific lobes in CMIP5 pre-industrial 
control and historical simulations (Henley et al., 2017), a bias that remains in CMIP6 (Figure 3.39b). 
 
Biases in the PDV temporal properties and amplitude are present in CMIP5 (Cheung et al., 2017; Henley, 
2017). While model evaluation is severely hampered by short observational records and incomplete 
observational coverage before satellite measurements started, the duration of PDV phases appears to be 
shorter in coupled models than in observations, and correspondingly the ratio of decadal to interannual 
variance is underestimated (Henley et al. 2017; Figure 3.39e,f). This apparent bias may be associated with 
overly biennial behaviour of Pacific trade wind variability and related ENSO activity, leaving too weak 
variability on decadal timescales (Kociuba and Power, 2015). ENSO influence on the extratropical North 
Pacific Ocean at decadal timescales is also very diverse among both CMIP3 and CMIP5 models, being 
controlled by multiple factors (Nidheesh et al., 2017). In terms of amplitude, the variance of the PDV index 
after decadal filtering is significantly weaker in the concatenated CMIP5 ensemble than the three 
observational estimates used in Figure 3.39e (p < 0.1 with an F-test). Consequently, the observed PDV 
fluctuations over the historical period often lie in the tails of the model distributions (Figure 3.39e,f). Even if 
one cannot rule out that the observed PDV over the instrumental era represents an exceptional period of 
variability, it is plausible that the tendency of the CMIP5 models to systematically underestimate the low 
frequency variance is due to an incomplete representation of decadal-scale mechanisms in these models. This 
situation is slightly improved in CMIP6 historical simulations but remains a concern (Fasullo et al., 2020). 
The results of McGregor et al. (2018) suggest that the underrepresentation of the magnitude stems from 
Atlantic mean SST bias (Section 3.5.1.2) through inter-basin coupling. 
 
While PDV is primarily understood as an internal mode of variability (Si and Hu, 2017), there are some 
indications that anthropogenically induced SST changes project onto PDV and have contributed to its past 
evolution (Bonfils and Santer, 2011; Dong et al., 2014a; Boo et al., 2015; Xu and Hu, 2018). However, the 
level of evidence is limited because of the difficulty in correctly separating internal versus externally forced 
components in the observed SST variations, and because it is unclear whether the dynamics of the PDV are 
operative in this forced SST change pattern. Over the last two to three decades which encompass the period 
of slower GMST increase (Cross-Chapter Box 3.1), Smith et al. (2016) found that anthropogenic aerosols 
have driven part of the PDV change toward its negative phase. A similar result is shown in Takahashi and 
Watanabe (2016) who found intensification of the Pacific Walker circulation in response to aerosol forcing 
(Section 3.3.3.1). Indeed, CMIP6 models simulate a negative PDV trend since the 1980s (Figure 3.39f), 
which is much weaker than internal variability. However, a response to anthropogenic aerosols is not 
robustly identified in a large ensemble of a model (Oudar et al., 2018), across CMIP5 models (Hua et al., 
2018), or in idealized model simulations (Kuntz and Schrag, 2016). Alternatively, inter-basin teleconnections 
associated with the warming of the North Atlantic Ocean related to the mid-1990s phase shift of the AMV 
(McGregor et al., 2014; Li et al., 2015d; Chikamoto et al., 2016; Kucharski et al., 2016; Ruprich-Robert et 
al., 2017), and also in the Indian Ocean (Luo et al., 2012; Mochizuki et al., 2016), could have favoured a 
delayed PDV transition to its negative phase in the 2000s. Considering the possible influence of external 
forcing on Indian Ocean decadal variability (Section 3.7.4) and AMV (Section 3.7.7), any such human 
influence on PDV would be indirect through changes in these ocean basins, and then imported to the Pacific 
via inter-basin coupling. However, this human influence on AMV, and how consistently the inter-basin 
processes affect PDV phase shifts, are uncertain. Other modelling studies find that anthropogenic aerosols 
can influence the PDV (Verma et al., 2019; Amiri-Farahani et al., 2020; Dow et al., 2020). It is however 
unclear whether and how much those forcings contributed to the observed variations of PDV. In CMIP6 
models, the temporal correlation of the multi-model ensemble mean PDV index with its observational 
counterpart is insignificant and negligible (Figure 3.39f), suggesting that any externally-driven component in 
historical PDV variations was weak. Lastly, the multi-model ensemble mean computed from CMIP6 
historical simulations shows slightly stronger variation than the CMIP5 counterpart, suggesting a greater 
simulated influence from external forcings in CMIP6. Still, the fraction of the forced signal to the total PDV 
is very low (Figure 3.39f), in contrast to AMV (Section 3.7.7). Consistently, Liguori et al. (2020) estimate 
that the variance fraction of the externally-driven to total PDV is up to only 15% in a multi-model large 
ensemble of historical simulations. These findings support an assessment that PDV is mostly driven by 
internal variability since the pre-industrial era. The sensitivity of ensemble-mean PDV trends to the 
ensemble size (Oudar et al., 2018), and the dominance of the ensemble spread over the ensemble mean in the 
60-year trend of the equatorial Pacific zonal SST gradient in large ensemble simulations (Watanabe et al., 
2021), also support this statement. 
 
In CMIP5 last millennium simulations, there is no consistency in temporal variations of PDV across the 
ensemble (Fleming and Anchukaitis, 2016). This supports the notion that PDV is internal in nature. 
However, this issue remains difficult to firmly conclude because paleoclimate reconstructions of PDV have 
too poor a level of agreement for a rigorous model evaluation in past millennia (Henley, 2017). 
 
To conclude, there is high confidence that internal variability has been the main driver of the PDV since pre-
industrial times, despite some modelling evidence for potential external influence. This assessment is 
supported by studies based on large ensemble simulations that found the dominance of internally-driven 
PDV, and the CMIP6-based assessment (Figure 3.39). As such, PDV is an important driver of decadal 
internal climate variability which limits detection of human influence on various aspects of decadal climate 
change on global to regional scales (high confidence). Model evaluation of PDV is hampered by short 
observational records, spatial incompleteness of observations before the satellite observation era, and poor 
agreement among paleoclimate reconstructions. Despite the limitations of these model-observation 
comparisons, CMIP5 models, on average, simulate broadly realistic spatial structures of the PDV, but with a 
clear bias in the South Pacific (medium confidence). CMIP5 models also very likely underestimate PDV 
magnitude. CMIP6 models tend to show better overall performance in spatial structure and magnitude of 
PDV, but there is low confidence in this assessment due to the lack of literature.

## 3.7.7  Atlantic Multidecadal Variability 
 
Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV) refers to a climate mode representing basin-wide multidecadal 
fluctuations in surface temperatures in the North Atlantic (Figure 3.40a,f), with teleconnections particularly 
pronounced over the adjacent continents and the Arctic. The AMV phenomenon is usually assessed through 
SST anomalies averaged over the entire North Atlantic basin, hereafter the AMV index, but it is associated 
with many physical processes including three-dimensional ocean circulation, such as AMOC fluctuations 
(Section 3.5.4), gyre adjustments, and salt and heat transport in the entire North Atlantic and subarctic 
basins. The AMV, together with the PDV, has been shown to have modulated GSAT on multi-decadal 
timescales since pre-industrial time (Cross Chapter-Box 3.1, Wu et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020). A detailed 
description of the AMV as well as its associated teleconnection over land is given in Annex IV.2.7. 

In AR5, climate models suggested that the AMV was primarily internally-driven alongside some 
contribution from external forcings (mainly anthropogenic aerosols) over the late 20th century. But AR5 also 
concluded that models show medium performance in reproducing the observed AMV, with difficulties in 
simulating the timescale, the spatial structure and the coherency between all the physical processes involved.  
 
Climate models analyzed since AR5 continue to simulate AMV-like variability as part of their internal 
variability. This statement is mostly based on CMIP5 pre-industrial control and historical simulations 
(Wouters et al., 2012; Schmith et al., 2014; Menary et al., 2015; Ruprich-Robert and Cassou, 2015; Brown et 
al., 2016b; Chen et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2018b) and is also true for the CMIP6 models (Menary et al., 2018; 
Voldoire et al., 2019b). Models also continue to support links to a wide array of remote climate influences 
through atmospheric teleconnections (Martin et al., 2013; Ruprich-Robert et al., 2017, 2018; Monerie et al., 
2019; Qasmi et al., 2020; Ruggieri et al., 2020). Even if debate remains (Clement et al., 2015; Cane et al., 
2017; Mann et al., 2020), there is now stronger evidence for a crucial role of oceanic dynamics in internal 
AMV that is primarily linked to the AMOC and its interplay with the NAO (Zhang et al., 2013a; Müller et 
al., 2015; O’Reilly et al., 2016a, 2019b; Delworth et al., 2017; Zhang, 2017; Kim et al., 2019; Sun et al., 
2019). However, considerable diversity in the spatio-temporal properties of the simulated AMV is found in 
both pre-industrial control and historical CMIP5 experiments (Zhang and Wang, 2013; Wills et al., 2019). 
Such model diversity is presumably associated with the wide range of coupled processes associated with 
AMV (Baker et al., 2017; Woollings et al., 2018a) including large-scale atmospheric teleconnections and 
regional feedbacks relating to tropical clouds, Arctic sea ice in the subarctic basins and Saharan dust, whose 
relative importance and interactions across timescales are specific to each model (Brown et al., 2016; Martin 
et al, 2014). 
 
Additional studies since AR5 corroborate that CMIP5-era models tend to underestimate many aspects of 
observed AMV and its SST fingerprint. On average, the duration of the modelled AMV episodes is too short, 
its magnitude is too weak and its basin-wide SST spatial structure is limited by the poor representation of the 
link between the tropical North Atlantic and the subpolar North Atlantic/Nordic seas (Martin et al., 2013; 
Qasmi et al., 2017). Such mismatches between observed and simulated AMV (Figure 3.40c-e) have been 
associated with intrinsic model biases in both mean state (Menary et al., 2015; Drews and Greatbatch, 2016) 
and variability in the ocean and overlying atmosphere. For instance, compared to available observational 
data CMIP5 models underestimate the ratio of decadal to interannual variability of the main drivers of AMV, 
namely the AMOC, NAO and related North Atlantic jet variations (Bracegirdle et al., 2018; Kim et al., 
2018a; Simpson et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2018) (Section 3.7.1), which has strong implications for the 
simulated temporal statistics of AMV, AMV-induced teleconnections (Ault et al., 2012; Menary et al., 2015) 
and AMV predictability.  
 
The increase of AMV variance in CMIP6 models (stronger magnitude and longer duration) seems to be 
explained by the enhanced variability in the subpolar North Atlantic SST (Figure 3.40b,c), which is 
particularly pronounced in some models, associated with greater variability in the AMOC (Voldoire et al., 
2019a; Boucher et al., 2020; Section 3.5.4) and greater GMST multidecadal variability (Voldoire et al., 
2019b; Parsons et al., 2020; Section 3.3.1) (Figure 3.40c-f). The decadal variance in SST in the subpolar 
North Atlantic seems now to be slightly overestimated in CMIP6 compared to observational estimates, while 
the AMV-related tropical SST anomalies remains weaker in line with CMIP5 (Figure 3.40b). The 
mechanisms producing the tropical-extratropical relationship at decadal timescales remain poorly understood 
despite stronger evidence since AR5 for the importance of the subpolar gyre SST anomalies in generating 
tropical changes through atmospheric teleconnection (Caron et al., 2015; Ruprich-Robert et al., 2017; Kim et 
al., 2020). Significant discrepancies remain in the simulated AMV spatial pattern when historical simulations 
are compared to multivariate observations (Yan et al., 2018; Robson et al., 2020).  
 
There is additional evidence since AR5 that external forcing has been playing an important role in shaping 
the timing and intensity of the observed AMV since pre-industrial times (Bellomo et al., 2018; Andrews et 
al., 2020). The time synchronisation between observed and multi-model mean AMV SST indices is 
significant in both CMIP5 and CMIP6 historical simulations, while the explained variance of the forced 
response in CMIP6 appears stronger (Figure 3.40d-f). The competition between greenhouse gas warming 
and anthropogenic sulphate aerosol cooling has been proposed to be particularly important over the latter 
half of the 20th century (Booth et al., 2012; Steinman et al., 2015; Murphy et al., 2017; Undorf et al., 2018a; 
Haustein et al., 2019). The latest observed AMV shift from the cold to the warm phase in the mid-1990s at 
the surface ocean is well captured in the CMIP6 forced component and may be associated with the lagged 
response to increased AMOC due to strong anthropogenic aerosol forcing over 1955-1985 (Menary et al., 
2020) in combination with the rapid response through surface flux processes to declining aerosol forcing and 
increasing greenhouse gas influence since then. However, natural forcings may have also played a significant 
role. For instance, volcanic forcing has been shown to contribute in part to the cold phases of the AMV-
related SST anomalies observed in the 20th century (Terray, 2012; Bellucci et al., 2017; Swingedouw et al., 
2017; Birkel et al., 2018). Over the last millenium, natural forcings including major volcanic eruptions and 
fluctuations in solar activity are thought to have driven a larger fraction of the multidecadal variations in the 
AMV, with some interplay with internal processes (Otterå et al., 2010; Knudsen et al., 2014; Moffa-Sánchez 
et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2017b; Malik et al., 2018; Mann et al., 2021), but other studies question the role of 
natural forcings over this period (Zanchettin et al., 2014; Lapointe et al., 2020).  
 
Model evaluation of the AMV phenomenon remains difficult because of short observational records 
(especially of detailed process-based observations), the lack of stationarity in the variance, spatial patterns 
and frequency of the AMV assessed from modelled SST (Qasmi et al., 2017), difficulties in estimating the 
forced signals in both historical simulations and observations (Tandon and Kushner, 2015), and because of 
probable interplay between internally and externally-driven processes (Watanabe and Tatebe, 2019). 
Furthermore, models simulate a large range of historical anthropogenic aerosol forcing (Smith et al., 2020) 
and questions often referred to as signal-to-noise paradox have been raised concerning the models’ ability to 
correctly simulate the magnitude of the response of AMV-related atmospheric circulation phenomena, such 
as the NAO (Section 3.7.1), to both internally and externally generated changes (Scaife and Smith, 2018). 
Related methodological and epistemological uncertainties also call into question the relevance of the 
traditional basin-average SST index to assessing the AMV phenomenon (Zanchettin et al., 2014; Frajka-
Williams et al., 2017; Haustein et al., 2019; Wills et al., 2019).  
 
To summarize, results from CMIP5 and CMIP6 models together with new statistical techniques to evaluate 
the forced component of modelled and observed AMV, provide robust evidence that external forcings have 
modulated AMV over the historical period. In particular, anthropogenic and volcanic aerosols are thought to 
have played a role in the timing and intensity of the negative (cold) phase of AMV recorded from the mid-
1960s to mid-1990s and subsequent warming (medium confidence). However, there is low confidence in the 
estimated magnitude of the human influence. The limited level of confidence is primarily explained by 
difficulties in accurately evaluating model performance in simulating AMV. The evaluation is severely 
hampered by short instrumental records but also, equally importantly, by the lack of detailed and coherent 
long-term process-based observations (for example of the AMOC, aerosol optical depth, surface fluxes and 
cloud changes), which limit our process understanding. In addition, studies often rely solely on simplistic 
SST indices that may be hard to interpret (Zhang et al., 2016) and may mask critical physical inconsistencies 
in simulations of the AMV compared to observations (Zhang, 2017).

# 3.8  Synthesis across Earth System Components 
 
## 3.8.1  Multivariate Attribution of Climate Change 
 
AR5 concluded that human influence on the climate system is clear (IPCC, 2013), based on observed 
increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, positive radiative forcing, observed warming, 
and physical understanding of the climate system. AR5 also assessed that it was virtually certain that internal 
variability alone could not account for observed warming since 1951 (Bindoff et al., 2013). Evidence has 
grown since AR5 that observed changes since the 1950s in many parts of the climate system are attributable 
to anthropogenic influence. So far, this chapter has focused on examining individual aspects of the climate 
system in separate sections. The results presented in Sections 3.3 to 3.7 substantially strengthen our 
assessment of the role of human influence on climate since pre-industrial times. In this section we look 
across the whole climate system to assess to what extent a physically consistent picture of human induced 
change emerges across the climate system (Figure 3.41). 
 
The observed global surface air temperature warming of 0.9-1.2°C in 2010-2019 is much greater than can be 
explained by internal variability (likely -0.2°C-0.2°C) or natural forcings (likely -0.1°C-0.1°C) alone, but 
consistent with the assessed anthropogenic warming (likely 0.8°C-1.3°C) (Section 3.3.1.1). Moreover it is 
very likely that human-induced greenhouse gas increases were the main driver of tropospheric warming since 
1979 (Section 3.3.1.2) and virtually certain that greenhouse gas forcing was the main driver of the observed 
changes in hot and cold extremes on the global scale (Cross-Chapter Box 3.2). 
 
As might be expected from a warming atmosphere, moisture in the troposphere has increased and 
precipitation patterns have changed. Human influence has likely contributed to the observed changes in 
humidity and precipitation (Section 3.3.2). It is likely that human influence, in particular due to greenhouse 
gas forcing, is the main driver of the observed intensification of heavy precipitation in global land regions 
during recent decades (Cross-Chapter Box 3.2). The pattern of ocean salinity changes indicate that fresh 
regions are becoming fresher and that salty regions are becoming saltier as a result of changes in ocean-
atmosphere fluxes through evaporation and precipitation (high confidence) making it extremely likely that 
human influence has contributed to observed near-surface and subsurface salinity changes since the mid-20th 
century (Section 3.5.2.2). Taken together this evidence indicates a human influence on the water cycle. 
 
It is very likely that human influence was the main driver of Arctic sea ice loss since the late 1970s (3.4.1), 
and very likely that it contributed to the observed reductions in Northern Hemisphere springtime snow cover 
since 1950 (3.4.2). Human influence was very likely the main driver of the recent global, near-universal 
retreat of glaciers and it is very likely that it contributed to the observed surface melting of the Greenland Ice 
Sheet over the past two decades (Sections 3.4.3). It is extremely likely that human influence was the main 
driver of the ocean heat content increase observed since the 1970s (Section 3.5.1), and very likely that human 
influence was the main driver of the observed global mean sea level rise since at least 1970 (Section 3.5.3). 
 
Combining the evidence from across the climate system (Sections 3.3-3.7) increases the level of confidence 
in the attribution of observed climate change to human influence and reduces the uncertainties associated 
with assessments based on a single variable. From this combined evidence, it is unequivocal that human 
influence has warmed the global climate system.

## 3.8.2  Multivariate Model Evaluation 
 
Similar to the assessment of multivariate attribution of climate change in the previous section, this section 
covers the performance of the models across different variables (Sections 3.8.2.1) and different classes of 
models (Section 3.8.2.2). Here the focus is on a system-wide assessment using integrative measures of model 
performance that characterize model performance using multiple diagnostic fields derived from multi-model 
ensembles. 
 
 
### 3.8.2.1 Integrative Measures of Model Performance
 
The purpose of this section is to use multivariate analyses to address how well models simulate present-day 
and historical climate. For every diagnostic field considered, model performance is compared to one or 
multiple observational references, and the quality of the simulation is expressed as a single number, for 
example a correlation coefficient or a root mean square difference versus the observational reference. By 
simultaneously assessing different performance indices, model improvements can be quantified, similarities 
in behaviour between different models become apparent, and dependencies between various indices become 
evident (Gleckler et al., 2008; Waugh and Eyring, 2008).  
 
AR5 found significant differences between models in the simulation of mean climate in the CMIP5 ensemble 
when measured against meteorological reanalyses and observations (Flato et al., 2013), see also Stouffer et 
al. (2017). AR5 determined that for the diagnostic fields analysed, the models usually compared similarly 
against two different reference datasets, suggesting that model errors were generally larger than 
observational uncertainties or other differences between the observational references. In agreement with 
previous assessments, the CMIP5 multi-model mean generally performed better than individual models 
(Annan and Hargreaves, 2011; Rougier, 2016). AR5 considered 13 atmospheric fields in its assessment for 
the instrumental period but did not assess multi-variate model performance in other climate domains (e.g., 
ocean, land, and sea ice). AR5 found only modest improvement regarding the simulation of climate for two 
periods of the Earth’s history (the Last Glacial Maximum and the mid-Holocene) between CMIP5 and 
previous paleoclimate simulations. Similarly, for the modern period only modest, incremental progress was 
found between CMIP3 and CMIP5 regarding the simulation of precipitation and radiation. The 
representation of clouds also showed improvement, but remained a key challenge in climate modelling (Flato 
et al., 2013). 
 
The type of multi-variate analysis of models presented in AR5 remains critical to building confidence for 
example in projections of climate change. It is expanded here to the previous-generation CMIP3 and present-
generation CMIP6 models and also to more variables and more climate domains, covering land and ocean as 
well as sea ice. The multi-variate evaluation of these three generations of models is performed relative to the 
observational datasets listed in Annex I, Table AI.1. For many of these datasets, a rigorous characterization 
of the observational uncertainty is not available, see discussion in Chapter 2. Here, as much as possible, 
multiple independent observational datasets are used. Disagreements among them would cause differences in 
model scoring, indicating that observational uncertainties may be substantial compared to model errors. 
Conversely, similar scores against different observational datasets would suggest model biases may be larger 
than the observational uncertainty.  
 
An analysis of a basket of 16 atmospheric variables (Figure 3.42a) assessed across CMIP3, CMIP5, and 
CMIP6 models but excluding high-resolution models participating in HighResMIP, reveals the progress 
made between these three generations of models (Bock et al., 2020). Progress is evidenced by the increasing 
prevalence of blue colours (indicating a performance better than the median) for the more recent model 
versions. Additionally, a few CMIP6 models outperform the best-performing CMIP5 models. Progress is 
evident across all 16 variables. As noted in AR5, the models typically score similarly against both 
observational reference datasets, indicating that indeed uncertainties in these references are smaller than 
model biases. Several models and model families perform better compared to observational references than 
the median, across a majority of the climate variables assessed, and conversely some other models or model 
families compare more poorly against these reference datasets. Such a good correspondence across a range 
of diagnostic fields probing different aspects of climate enhances confidence that the improved performances 
reflect progress in the physical realism of these simulations. An alternative explanation, that progress is due 
to a cancellation of errors achieved by model tuning, appears improbable given the large number of 
diagnostic fields involved here. However, several instances of poor model performance (red colours in 
Figure 3.42) still exist in the CMIP6 ensemble. Family relationships (i.e. various degrees of shared 
formulations; Knutti et al., 2013) between the models are apparent, for example, the GISS, GFDL, CESM, 
CNRM, and HadGEM/UKESM1/ACCESS families score similarly across all atmospheric variables, both for 
the CMIP5 and CMIP6 generations. In the cases of CESM2 / CESM2(WACCM), CNRM-CM6-1 / CNRM-
ESM2-1, NorCPM1 / NorESM2-LM, and HadGEM3-GC31-LL / UKESM1-0-LL, the high-complexity 
model scores as well or better than its lower-complexity counterpart, indicating that increasing complexity 
by adding Earth system features, which by removing constraints could be expected to degrade a model’s 
performance, does not necessarily do so. Several high climate-sensitivity models (Section 7.5; Meehl et al., 
2020), in particular CanESM5, CESM2, CESM2-WACCM, HadGEM3-GC31-LL, and UKESM1-0-LL, 
score well against the benchmarks. In accordance with AR5 and earlier assessments, the multi-model mean, 
with some notable exceptions, is better than any individual model (Annan and Hargreaves, 2011; Rougier, 
2016).  
 
Regarding model performance for the ocean and the cryosphere (Figure 3.42b), it is apparent that for many 
models there are substantial differences between the scores for Arctic and Antarctic sea ice concentration. 
This might suggest that it is not sea ice physics directly that is driving such differences in performance but 
rather other influences, such as differences in geography, the role of large ice shelves (which are absent in 
the Arctic), or large-scale ocean dynamics. As for atmospheric variables, progress is evident also across all 4 
ocean and 10 land variables from CMIP5 to CMIP6. 
 
In summary, CMIP6 models perform generally better for a basket of variables covering mean historical 
climate across the atmosphere, ocean, and land domains than previous-generation and older models (high 
confidence). Earth System models characterized by additional biogeochemical feedbacks often perform at 
least as well as related more constrained, lower-complexity models lacking these feedbacks (medium 
confidence). In many cases, the models score similarly against both observational references, indicating that 
model errors are usually larger than observational uncertainties (high confidence). Moreover, synthesizing 
across Sections 3.3-3.7, we assess that the CMIP6 multi-model mean captures most aspects of observed 
climate change well (high confidence). 
 
<figref>3.42</figref> 
 
Using centred pattern correlations (quantifying pattern similarity on a scale of -1 to 1, with 1 expressing 
perfect similarity and 0 no relationship) for selected fields, the AR5 documented improvements between 
CMIP3 and CMIP5 in surface air temperature, outgoing longwave radiation, and precipitation (Figure 9.6 of 
Flato et al., 2013). Little further progress between CMIP3 and CMIP5 was found for fields that were already 
quite well simulated in CMIP3 (such as surface air temperature and outgoing longwave). For precipitation, 
the spread reduced because the worst-performing models improved. The short-wave cloud radiative effect 
remained relatively poorly simulated with significant inter-model spread (e.g., Calisto et al., 2014). This 
comparison of centred pattern correlations is designed to help determine the quality of simulation of different 
diagnostics relative to each other, and also to examine progress between generations of models. Figure 3.43 
shows the centred pattern correlations for 16 variables for CMIP3, CMIP5 and CMIP6 models. In the 
ensemble averages, CMIP6 performs better than CMIP5 and CMIP3 for near-surface temperature, 
precipitation, mean sea-level pressure, and many other variables. For the variables shown, the uncertainties 
in observational datasets, in particular for precipitation and northward wind at 850 hPa, remain substantial 
relative to mean model errors (see grey dots in Figure 3.43). 
 
<figref>3.43</figref> 
 
In addition to the multivariate assessments of simulations of the recent historical period, simulations of 
selected periods of the Earth’s more distant history can be used to benchmark climate models by exposing 
them to climate forcings that are radically different from the present and recent past (Harrison et al., 2015, 
2016; Kageyama et al., 2018b; Tierney et al., 2020a). These time periods provide an out-of-sample test of 
models because they are not in general used in the process of model development. They encompass a range 
of climate drivers, such as volcanic and solar forcing for the Last Millennium, orbital forcing for the mid-
Holocene and Last Interglacial, and changes in greenhouse gases and ice sheets for the LGM, mid-Pliocene 
Warm Period, and early Eocene (Sections 2.2 and 2.3). These drivers led to climate changes, including in 
surface temperature (Section 2.3.1.1) and the hydrological cycle (Section 2.3.1.3.1), which are described by 
paleoclimate proxies that have been synthesised to support evaluations of models on a global and regional 
scale. However, the more sparse, indirect, and regionally incomplete climate information available from 
paleo-archives motivates a different form for the multivariate analysis of simulations available covering 
these periods versus the equivalent for the historical period, as described below.  
 
AR5 found that reconstructions and simulations of past climates both show similar responses in terms of 
large-scale patterns of climate change, such as polar amplification (Flato et al., 2013). However, for several 
regional signals (e.g., the north-south temperature gradient in Europe and regional precipitation changes), the 
magnitude of change seen in the proxies relative to the pre-industrial period was underestimated by the 
models. When benchmarking CMIP5/PMIP3 models against reconstructions of the mid-Holocene and LGM, 
AR5 found only a slight improvement compared with earlier model versions across a range of variables. For 
the Last Interglacial, it was noted that the magnitude of observed annual mean warming in the NH was only 
reached in summer in the models. For the mid-Pliocene Warm Period, it was noted that both proxies and 
models showed a polar amplification of temperature compared with the pre-industrial period, but a formal 
model evaluation was not carried out.  
 
Since AR5, new simulation protocols have been developed in the framework of PMIP4 (Kageyama et al., 
2018b) which is further described for the mid-Holocene and the Last Interglacial by Otto-Bliesner et al. 
(2017), for the LGM by Kageyama et al. (2017), for the Pliocene by Haywood et al. (2016), and for the early 
Eocene by Lunt et al. (2017). These have resulted in new model simulations for these time periods (Brierley 
et al., 2020; Haywood et al., 2020; Kageyama et al., 2021a; Lunt et al., 2021; Otto-Bliesner et al., 2021). 
These time periods span an assessed temperature range of 20°C (Section 2.3.1.1), and for all periods the 
PMIP4 model ensemble mean is within 0.5°C of the assessed range of GSAT (Figure 3.44a). Those time 
periods for which the model ensemble mean is outside the assessed range of GSAT, the mid-Holocene and 
the Last Interglacial, are primarily forced by orbital changes not greenhouse gas forcing, and as a result the 
forcing, as well as the assessed and modelled response, are relatively close to zero in the global annual mean. 
During these periods, climate change therefore is a consequence of more poorly understood Earth System 
feedbacks acting on the response to orbital differences versus the present-day, affecting the seasonality of 
insolation. 
 
Polar amplification in the LGM, mid-Pliocene Warm Period, and Early Eocene climatic optimum (EECO) 
simulations are assessed in Section 7.4.4. Here we focus on the mid-Holocene and the LGM, which have 
been a part of AMIP or CMIP through several assessment cycles, and as such serve as a reference to quantify 
regional model-data agreement from one IPCC assessment to another. We compare the results from 15 
CMIP6 models using the PMIP4 protocol (CMIP6-PMIP4), with non-CMIP6 models using the PMIP4 
protocol, with PMIP3 models, and with regional temperature and precipitation changes from proxies for the 
mid-Holocene (Figure 3.44b). For 6 out of 7 variables shown, the CMIP6 multi-model mean captures the 
correct sign of the change. For 5 out of 7 of them the CMIP6 ensemble mean is within the reconstructed 
range. For the other two variables (changes in the mean temperature of the warmest month over North 
America and in the mean annual precipitation over West Africa) nearly all PMIP4 and PMIP3 models are 
outside the reconstructed range. CMIP6 models show regional patterns of temperature changes similar to the 
PMIP3 ensemble (Brierley et al., 2020), but the slight mid-Holocene cooling in PMIP4 compared with 
PMIP3, probably associated with lower imposed mid-Holocene carbon dioxide concentrations (Otto-Bliesner 
et al., 2017), improves the regional model performance for summer and winter temperatures (Figure 3.44b). 
However, this cooling also results in a CMIP6 mid-Holocene GSAT that lies further from the assessed range 
(Figure 3.44a). All models show an expansion of the monsoon areas from the pre-industrial to the mid-
Holocene simulations in the NH, but this expansion in some cases is only large enough to cancel out the bias 
in the pre-industrial control simulations (Brierley et al., 2020; Section 3.3.3.2). There is a slight improvement 
in representing the northward expansion of the West African monsoon region in PMIP4 compared with 
PMIP3 (Figure 3.11, Figure 3.44b).  

Fourteen simulations of the LGM climate have been produced following the CMIP6-PMIP4 protocol using 
11 models, 5 of which are from the latest CMIP6 generation. The multi-model-mean global cooling 
simulated by these models is close to that simulated by the CMIP5-PMIP3 ensemble, but the range of results 
is larger. The increase in the range is largely due to the inclusion of CESM2 which simulates a much larger 
cooling than the other PMIP4 models (Figure 3.44a). This is consistent with its larger climate sensitivity 
(Zhu et al., 2021) (see also Section 3.3.1.1). The other models on average also simulate slightly larger 
cooling, possibly a consequence of the lower ice sheet assumed in PMIP4 versus PMIP3 (Kageyama et al., 
2017, 2021a). The PMIP4 multi-model mean is within the range of reconstructed regional averages for 4 out 
of 7 regional variables; this is unchanged from PMIP3 but for different variables (Figure 3.44c). For all 
fields, the results of many individual models are outside the reconstructed range. For 2 variables out of 7 
(changes in the mean temperature of the warmest month and mean annual precipitation over Western 
Europe) no model is within the range of the reconstructions. This analysis is strengthened compared with the 
equivalent analysis in AR5 because it is based on larger and improved reconstructions (Cleator et al., 2020). 
Most CMIP6-PMIP4 models simulate slightly stronger AMOC, but no strong deepening of the AMOC 
(Kageyama et al., 2021a), while most other PMIP4 models simulate a strengthening and strong deepening of 
the AMOC, as was the case for the PMIP3 models (Muglia and Schmittner, 2015; Sherriff-Tadano et al., 
2018). Only one model (CESM1.2) shows a shoaling of LGM AMOC which is consistent with 
reconstructions (Marzocchi and Jansen, 2017; Sherriff-Tadano et al., 2018).  
 
17 PMIP4 models completed Last Interglacial simulations (Otto-Bliesner et al., 2021). The comparison to 
reconstructions is generally good, except for some discrepancies, such as for upwelling systems such as in 
the South East Atlantic or resulting from local melting of remnant ice sheets absent in the Last Interglacial 
simulation protocol. All models simulate a decrease in Arctic sea ice in summer, commensurate with 
increased summer insolation, while some models even simulate a large or complete loss (Guarino et al., 
2020; Kageyama et al., 2021b). Sea ice reconstructions for the Central Arctic are however too uncertain to 
evaluate this behaviour. The Last Interglacial simulations indicate a clear relationship between simulated sea 
ice loss and model responses to increased greenhouse gas forcing (Kageyama et al., 2021b; Otto-Bliesner et 
al., 2021). 
 
Overall, the PMIP multi-model means agree very well (within 0.5°C of the assessed range) with GSAT 
reconstructed from proxies across multiple time periods, spanning a range from 6°C colder than pre-
industrial (Last Glacial Maximum) to 14°C warmer than pre-industrial (Early Eocene Climate Optimum) 
(high confidence). During the orbitally-forced mid-Holocene, the CMIP6 multi-model mean captures the 
sign of the regional changes in temperature and precipitation in most regions assessed, and there have been 
some regional improvements compared to AR5 (medium confidence). The limited number of CMIP6 
simulations of the LGM hinders model evaluation of the multi-model mean, but for both LGM and mid-
Holocene, models tend to underestimate the magnitude of large changes (high confidence). Some long-
standing model-data discrepancies, such as a dry bias in North Africa in the mid-Holocene, have not 
improved in CMIP6 compared with PMIP3 (high confidence).

### 3.8.2.2  Process Representation in Different Classes of Models 
 
Based on new scientific insights and newly available observations, many improvements have been made to 
models from CMIP5 to CMIP6, including changes in the representation of physics of the atmosphere, ocean, 
sea ice, and land surface. In many cases, changes in the detailed representation of cloud and aerosol 
processes have been implemented. The new generation of CMIP6 climate models also features increases in 
spatial resolution, as well as inclusion of additional Earth system processes and new components (see further 
details in Section 1.5.3.1 and in Tables AII.5 and AII.6). Such changes to model physics and resolution are 
often designed to improve the fitness-for-purpose of a model such as projecting regional aspects of climate 
(Section 10.3) or to more fully represent feedbacks to make the models more fit for long-term climate 
projections affected for example by carbon cycle feedbacks (see also Section 1.5.3.1). 
 
Factors affecting model performance include resolution, the type of dynamical core (spectral,. finite 
difference or finite volume), physics parameters and parameterisations, model structure (e.g. many of the 
coupled HighResMIP models (Haarsma et al., 2016) use the NEMO ocean model, affecting model diversity), 
and the range and degree of process realism (e.g. for aerosols, atmospheric chemistry and other Earth System 
components). This section particularly explores the influence of model resolution and of complexity on 
model performance (see also Section 8.5.1). 
 
A key advance in CMIP6 compared to CMIP5 is the presence of high-resolution models that have 
participated in HighResMIP. Resolution alone can significantly affect a model’s performance, with some 
effects propagating to the global scale. Recent studies have shown that enhancing the horizontal resolution of 
models is seen to significantly affect aspects of large-scale circulation as well as improve the simulation of 
small-scale processes and extremes when compared to CMIP3 and CMIP5 models (Haarsma et al., 2016; see 
also Section 11.4.3), with some models approaching 10 km resolution in the atmosphere (Kodama et al., 
2021) or ocean (Caldwell et al., 2019; Gutjahr et al., 2019; Roberts et al., 2019; Chang et al., 2020; Semmler 
et al., 2020). 
 
As discussed in Section 3.3, CMIP6 models reproduce observed large-scale mean surface temperature 
patterns as well as their CMIP5 predecessors, but biases in surface temperature in the mean of HighResMIP 
models are smaller than those in the mean of the corresponding standard resolution CMIP6 configurations of 
the same models (Figure 3.3; Section 3.3.1.1). The extent and causes of improvements due to increased 
horizontal resolutions in the atmosphere and ocean domains depend on the model (Kuhlbrodt et al., 2018; 
Roberts et al., 2018, 2019; Sidorenko et al., 2019), although they typically involve better process 
representation (for example of ocean currents and atmospheric storms) which can lead to reduced biases in 
top of atmosphere radiation and cloudiness. Precipitation has likewise improved in CMIP6 versus CMIP5 
models, but biases remain. The high resolution (< 25 km) class of models participating in HighResMIP 
compares regionally better against observations than the standard resolution CMIP6 models (of order 100 
km, Figure 3.13; Section 3.3.2.2), partly because of an improved representation of orographic (mountain-
induced) precipitation which constitutes a major fraction of precipitation on land, but other processes also 
play an important role (Vannière et al., 2019). However, there are also large parts of the tropical ocean where 
precipitation in high-resolution models is not improved compared to standard resolution CMIP6 models 
(Vannière et al., 2019). 
 
Additionally, the representation of surface and deeper ocean mean temperature is improved in models with 
higher horizontal resolution (Sections 3.5.1.1 and 3.5.1.2) with systematic improvements in coupled tropical 
Atlantic sea surface temperature and precipitation biases at higher resolutions (Roberts et al., 2019, single 
model; Vannière et al., 2019), the North Atlantic cold bias (Bock et al., 2020, multi-model; Roberts et al., 
2018, 2019; Caldwell et al., 2019; all single models) as well as deep ocean biases (Small et al., 2014; Griffies 
et al., 2015; Caldwell et al., 2019; Gutjahr et al., 2019; Roberts et al., 2019; Chang et al., 2020, all single 
model studies). Atlantic ocean transports (heat and volume) are also generally improved compared to 
observations (Grist et al., 2018; Caldwell et al., 2019; Docquier et al., 2019; Roberts et al., 2019, 2020c; 
Chang et al., 2020), as well as some aspects of air-sea interactions (Wu et al., 2019a, single model; Bellucci 
et al., 2021, multi-model). However, warm-biased sea surface temperatures in the Southern Ocean got worse 
in comparison to standard resolution CMIP6 models (Bock et al., 2020). AR5 noted problems with the 
simulation of clouds in this region which were later attributed to a lack of supercooled liquid clouds (Bodas-
Salcedo et al., 2016). Mesoscale ocean processes are critical to maintaining the Southern Ocean stratification 
and response to wind forcing (Marshall and Radko, 2003; Hallberg and Gnanadesikan, 2006), and their 
explicit representation requires even higher ocean resolution (Hallberg, 2013). Similarly, atmospheric 
convection remains unresolved even in the highest-resolution climate models participating in HighResMIP. 
However, there is also evidence of improvements in the frequency, distribution and interannual variability of 
tropical cyclones (Roberts et al., 2020a, 2020b), particularly in the NH (see further discussion in Section 
11.7.1.3), moisture budget (Vannière et al., 2019), and interaction with the ocean (Scoccimarro et al., 2017, 
single model). At higher resolution the track density of tropical cyclones is increased practically everywhere 
where tropical cyclones occur. Modelling of some climate extremes is shown to be improved in explosively 
developing extra-tropical cyclones (Vries et al., 2019; Jiaxiang et al., 2020), blocking (Fabiano et al., 2020; 
Schiemann et al., 2020; Section 3.3.3.3) and European extreme precipitation due to a better representation of 
the North Atlantic storm track (Van Haren et al., 2015) and orographic boundary conditions (Schiemann et 
al., 2018). 
 
In CMIP6 a number of Earth system models have increased the realism by which key biogeochemical 
aspects of the coupled Earth system are represented, affecting for example the carbon and nitrogen cycles, 
aerosols, and atmospheric chemistry (e.g., Cao et al., 2018; Gettelman et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2019; 
Mauritsen et al., 2019; Séférian et al., 2019; Sellar et al., 2019; Sidorenko et al., 2019; Swart et al., 2019; 
Dunne et al., 2020; Seland et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Ziehn et al., 2020). In addition to increased process 
realism, the level of coupling between the physical climate and biogeochemical components of the Earth 
system has also been enhanced in some models (Mulcahy et al., 2020) as well as across different 
biogeochemical components (see Section 5.4 for a discussion and Table 5.4 for an overview). For example, 
the nitrogen cycle is now simulated in several ESMs (Zaehle et al., 2015; Davies-Barnard et al., 2020). This 
advance accounts for the fertilization effect nitrogen availability has on vegetation and carbon uptake, 
reducing uncertainties in the simulations of the carbon uptake responses to physical climate change (Section 
3.6.1) and to CO2 increases (Arora et al., 2020), thus improving confidence in the simulated airborne fraction 
of CO2 emissions (Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020) and better constraining remaining carbon budgets (Section 
5.5). Such advances also allow investigation of land-based climate mitigation options (e.g. through changes 
in land management and associated terrestrial carbon uptake (Mahowald et al., 2017; Pongratz et al., 2018) 
or interactions between different facets of the managed Earth system, such as interactions between mitigation 
efforts targeting climate warming and air quality (West et al., 2013)). A number of developments also 
explicitly target improved simulation of the past.  
 
Further such ESM developments include: (i) Apart from the nitrogen cycle, extending terrestrial carbon 
cycle models to simulate interactions between the carbon cycle and other nutrient cycles, such as 
phosphorous, that are known to play an important role in limiting future plant uptake of CO2 (Zaehle et al., 
2015). (ii) Introducing explicit coupling between interactive atmospheric chemistry and aerosol schemes 
(Gettelman et al., 2019; Sellar et al., 2019), which has been shown to affect estimates of historical aerosol 
radiative forcing (Karset et al., 2018). Furthermore, interactive treatment of atmospheric chemistry in a full 
ESM supports investigation of interactions between climate and air quality mitigation efforts, such as in 
AerChemMIP (Collins et al., 2017) as well as interactions between stratospheric ozone recovery and global 
warming (Morgenstern et al., 2018). (iii) Couplings between components of Earth system models have been 
extended to increase their utility for studying future interactions across the full Earth system, such as 
between ocean biogeochemistry and cloud-aerosol processes (Mulcahy et al., 2020), vegetation and impacts 
on dust production (Kok et al., 2018), production of secondary organic aerosols (SOA, Zhao et al., 2017) and 
Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) whereby enhanced CO2 fertilization of land vegetation causes 
changes in regional surface albedo (Andrews et al., 2019). Increased coupling between physical climate and 
biogeochemical processes in a single ESM, along with an increased number of interactively represented 
processes, such as permafrost thaw, vegetation, wildfires and continental ice sheets increases our ability to 
investigate the potential for abrupt and interactive changes in the Earth system (see Sections 4.7.3 and 5.4.9 
and Box 5.1). Table 5.4 provides an overview of recent advances with representing the carbon cycle in 
ESMs. 
 
In summary, both high-resolution and high-complexity models have been evaluated as part of CMIP6. In 
comparison with standard resolution CMIP6 models, higher resolution probed under the HighResMIP 
activity (Haarsma et al., 2016) improves aspects of the simulation of climate (particularly concerning sea 
surface temperature) but discrepancies remain and there are some regions, such as parts of the Southern 
Ocean, where currently attainable resolution produces inferior performance (high confidence). Such model 
behaviour can indicate deficiencies in model physics that are not simply associated with resolution. In 
several cases, high-complexity ESMs that include additional interactions and thus have potential for 
additional associated model errors nevertheless perform as well as their low-complexity counterparts, 
illustrating that interactively simulating these Earth System components as part of the climate system is now 
well established.
