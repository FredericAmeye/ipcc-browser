# <goto>Atlas.es</goto> Executive summary 
 
This Atlas chapter assesses changes in mean climate at regional scales, in particular observed trends and 
their attribution and projected future changes. The main focus is on changes in temperature and precipitation 
(including snow and derived variables in polar regions) over land regions, though other variables, including 
for oceanic regions, are also discussed. Projected changes are presented both as relative to levels of global 
warming and for future time periods under a range of emissions scenarios. In order to facilitate summarizing 
assessment findings, a new set of WGI reference regions is used within the chapter which were derived 
following broad consultation and peer review. These are used in other chapters for summarizing regional 
information. This includes the assessment of climatic impact-driver changes in Chapter 12, which 
incorporates the changes in mean climate assessed in the Atlas. Another important new development since 
AR5 is the AR6 WGI Interactive Atlas, which is described in this chapter and is used to generate results both 
for the Atlas and other regional chapters. It is also a resource allowing exploration of datasets underpinning 
assessment findings in other chapters of the report.  
 
## Observed trends and projections in regional climate 
 
*Most land areas have warmed faster than the global average (high confidence) and very likely by at 
least 0.1℃ per decade since 1960. A surface temperature change signal has likely emerged over all 
land areas. Many areas very likely warmed faster since the 1980s, including areas of northern, eastern 
and south-western Africa, Australia, Central America, Amazonia and West Antarctica (0.2°C–0.3°C 
per decade), the Arabian Peninsula, Central and East Asia and Europe (0.3°C–0.5°C per decade) and 
Arctic and near-Arctic land regions (up to 1°C per decade, or more in a few areas).* {Figure Atlas.11, 
Interactive Atlas, Sections Atlas.3.1, Atlas.4.2, Atlas.5.1.2, Atlas.5.2.2, Atlas.5.3.2, Atlas.5.4.2, Atlas.5.5.2, 
Atlas.6.1.2, Atlas.6.2.2, Atlas.7.2, Atlas.8.2, Atlas.9.2, Atlas.10.2, Atlas.11.1.2, Atlas.11.2.2} 
 
*Significant positive trends in precipitation have been observed in most of North Asia, parts of West 
Central Asia, South-eastern South America, Northern Europe, Eastern North America, Western 
Antarctica and the Arctic (medium confidence). Significant negative trends have been observed in the 
Horn of Africa and southwest Western Australia (high confidence), parts of the Russian Far East, 
some parts of the Mediterranean and of the Caribbean, Southeast and Northeast Brazil and southern 
Africa (medium confidence), with the last attributed to anthropogenic warming of the Indian Ocean.* In 
the many other land areas there are no significant trends in annual precipitation over the period 1960–2015 
though increases in average precipitation intensity have been observed in the Sahel and Southeast Asia 
(medium confidence). {Figure Atlas.11, Interactive Atlas, Sections Atlas.3.1, Atlas.4.2, Atlas.5.1.2, 
Atlas.5.2.2, Atlas.5.3.2, Atlas.5.4.2, Atlas.5.5.2, Atlas.6.1.2, Atlas.6.2.2, Atlas.7.2, Atlas.8.2, Atlas.9.2, 
Atlas.10.2, Atlas.11.1.2, Atlas.11.2.2}.  
 
*The observed warming trends are projected to continue over the 21st century (high confidence) and 
over most land regions at a rate higher than the global average. At a global warming level of 4°C (i.e. 
relative to an 1850-1900 baseline) it is likely that most land areas will experience a further warming 
(from a 1995–2014 baseline) of at least 3°C and in some areas significantly more, including increases of 
4°C–6°C in the Sahara/Sahel, Southwest, Central and Northern Asia; Northern South America and 
Amazonia, West Central and Eastern Europe; and Western, Central and Eastern North America, and 
up to 8°C or more in some Arctic regions.* Across each of the continents, higher warming is likely to occur 
in northern Africa, the central interior of southern and Western Africa; in northern Asia; in Central Australia; 
in Amazonia; in northern Europe and northern North America (high confidence). Ranges of regional 
warming for global warming levels of 1.5ºC, 2ºC, 3ºC and 4ºC and for other time periods and emissions 
scenarios are available in the Interactive Atlas from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phases 5 and 6 
(CMIP5, CMIP6) and Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) projections. 
{Figure Atlas.12, Interactive Atlas, Sections Atlas.4.4, Atlas.5.1.4, Atlas.5.2.4, Atlas.5.3.4, Atlas.5.4.4, 
Atlas.5.5.4, Atlas.6.4, Atlas.7.4, Atlas.8.4, Atlas.9.4, Atlas.10.4, Atlas.11.4}  
 
*For given global warming levels, model projections from CMIP6 show future regional warming and 
precipitation changes that are similar to those projected by CMIP5. However, the larger climate 
sensitivity in some CMIP6 models and differences in the model forcings lead to a wider range of and 
higher projected regional warming in CMIP6 compared to CMIP5 projections for given time periods 
and emissions scenarios.* {Figure Atlas.13, Sections Atlas.4.4, Atlas.5.1.4, Atlas.5.2.4, Atlas.5.3.4, 
Atlas.5.4.4, Atlas.5.5.4, Atlas.6.1.4, Atlas.6.2.4, Atlas.7.4, Atlas.8.4, Atlas.9.4, Atlas.10.4, Atlas.11.1.4, 
Atlas.11.2.4}  
 
*Precipitation will change in most regions, either through changes in mean values or the characteristics 
of rainy seasons or daily precipitation statistics (high confidence). Regions where annual precipitation 
is likely to increase include the Ethiopian Highlands; East, South and North Asia; Southeast South 
America; northern Europe; northern and eastern North America and the polar regions. Regions 
where annual precipitation is likely to decrease include northern and southwest southern Africa and 
the Sahel, Indonesia, northern Arabian Peninsula, southwest Australia, Central America, southwest 
South America and southern Europe.* Changes in monsoons are likely to result in increased precipitation in 
northern China and in South Asia in summer (high confidence). Precipitation intensity will increase in many 
areas, including in some where annual mean reductions are likely (e.g., Southern Africa) (high confidence). 
Ranges of regional mean precipitation change for global warming levels of 1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C and 4°C and for 
other time periods and emissions scenarios are available in Interactive Atlas from CMIP5, CORDEX and 
CMIP6 projections. {Figure Atlas.13, Interactive Atlas, Sections Atlas.4.4, Atlas.5.1.4, Atlas.5.2.4, 
Atlas.5.3.4, Atlas.5.4.4, Atlas.5.5.4, Atlas.6.1.4, Atlas.6.2.4, Atlas.7.4, Atlas.8.4, Atlas.9.4, Atlas.10.4, 
Atlas.11.1.4, Atlas.11.2.4}  
 
## Cryosphere, Polar Regions and Small Islands  
 
*Many aspects of the cryosphere either have seen significant changes in the recent past or will see them 
during the 21st century (high confidence). Snow cover duration has very likely reduced over Siberia 
and Eastern and Northern Europe. Also, it is virtually certain that snow cover will experience a decline 
in these regions and over most of North America during the 21st century, in terms of water equivalent, 
extent and annual duration. Over the Hindu Kush-Himalaya, glacier mass is likely to decrease 
considerably (nearly 50%) under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios.* Snow cover has declined over 
Australia as has annual maximum snow mass over North America (medium confidence). Some high-latitude 
regions have experienced increases in winter snow (parts of northern Asia, medium confidence) or will do so 
in the future (very likely in parts of northern North America) due to the effect of increased snowfall 
prevailing over warming-induced increased snowmelt. {Sections 2.3.2.2, 3.4.2, Atlas.5.2.2, Atlas.5.3.4, 
Atlas.6.2, Atlas.8.2, Atlas.8.4, Atlas.9.2, Atlas.9.4} 
 
*It is very likely that the Arctic has warmed at more than twice the global rate over the past 50 years 
and that the Antarctic Peninsula experienced a strong warming trend starting in 1950s. It is likely that 
Arctic annual precipitation has increased, with the highest increases during the cold season. Antarctic 
precipitation and surface mass balance showed a significant positive trend over the 20th century, while 
strong interannual variability masks any existing trend over recent decades1 (medium confidence).*  
Significant warming trends are observed in other West Antarctic regions and at selected stations in East 
Antarctica since the 1950s (medium confidence). Under all assessed emission scenarios, both Polar regions 
are very likely to have higher annual mean surface air temperatures and more precipitation, with temperature 
increases higher than the global mean, most prominently in the Arctic. {Sections Atlas.11.1.2, Atlas.11.1.4, 
Atlas.11.2.2, Atlas.11.2.4} 
 
*It is very likely that most Small Islands have warmed over the period of instrumental records. 
Precipitation has likely decreased since the mid-20th century in some parts of the Pacific poleward of 
20° latitude in both hemispheres and in the Caribbean in June-July-August. It is very likely that sea 
levels will continue to rise in Small Island regions and that this will result in increased coastal flooding.*
Observed temperature trends are generally in the range of 0.15°C–0.2°C per decade. Rainfall trends in most 
other Pacific and Indian Ocean Small Islands are mixed and largely non-significant. There is limited 
evidence and low agreement on the cause of the Caribbean drying trend, though it is likely that both this and 
the Pacific drying trends will continue in coming decades with drying also projected in the part of the West 
Indian and Atlantic Oceans. Small Islands regions in the Western and equatorial Pacific and North Indian 
Ocean are likely to be wetter in the future. {Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.2, Sections Atlas.10.2, Atlas.10.4} 
 
## Model Evaluation, Technical Infrastructure and the Interactive Atlas 
 
*The regional performance of CMIP6 global climate models (GCMs) has improved overall compared to 
CMIP5 in simulating mean temperature and precipitation, though large errors still exist in some 
regions. In particular, improvements have been seen over Africa which has belatedly become a focus 
for GCM model development.* Other specific improvement include over East Asia for temperature and the 
winter monsoon, over parts of South Asia for the summer monsoon, over Australia (including influences of 
modes of variability), in simulation of Antarctic temperatures and Arctic sea ice. Notable errors include large 
cold biases in mountain ranges in South Asia, a significant wet bias over Central Asia, in the East Asia 
summer monsoon and in Antarctic precipitation. An in-depth evaluation of CMIP6 models is lacking for 
several regions (North and Southeast Asia, parts of West Central Asia, Central and South America), though 
CMIP5 models have been evaluated for many of these. {Sections Atlas.4.3, Atlas.5.1.3, Atlas.5.2.3, 
Atlas.5.3.3, Atlas.5.4.3, Atlas.5.5.3, Atlas.6.1.3, Atlas.6.2.3, Atlas.7.3, Atlas.8.3, Atlas.9.3, Atlas.10.3, 
Atlas.11.1.3, Atlas.11.2.3} 
 
*Since AR5, the improvement in regional climate modelling and the growing availability of regional 
simulations through coordinated dynamical downscaling initiatives such as CORDEX, have advanced 
the understanding of regional climate variability, adding value to CMIP global models, particularly in 
complex topography zones, coastal areas and small islands, and in the representation of extremes (high 
confidence).* In particular, regional climate models with polar-optimized physics are important for estimating 
the regional and local surface mass balance and are improved compared to reanalyses and GCMs when 
evaluated with observations (high confidence). There is still a lack of high-quality and high-resolution 
observational data to assess observational uncertainty in climate studies, and this compromises the ability to 
evaluate models (high confidence). {Sections Atlas.4.3, Atlas.5.1.3, Atlas.5.2.3, Atlas.5.3.3, Atlas.5.4.3, 
Atlas.5.5.3, Atlas.6.1.3, Atlas.6.2.3, Atlas.7.3, Atlas.8.3, Atlas.9.3, Atlas.10.3, Atlas.11.1.3, Atlas.11.2.3} 
 
*Significant improvements in technical infrastructure, open tools and methodologies for accessing and 
analysing observed and simulated climate data, and the progressive adoption of FAIR (findability, 
accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) data principles have very likely broadened the ability to 
interact with these data for a wide range of activities, including fundamental climate research, 
providing inputs into assessments of impacts, building resilience and developing adaptations.* Tools to 
analyse and assess climate information have improved to allow development of information that goes beyond 
averages (e.g., on future climate thresholds and extremes) and that is relevant for regional climate risk 
assessments. {Sections Atlas.2.2, Atlas.2.3} 
 
*The Interactive Atlas is a new WGI product developed to take advantage of the interactivity offered 
by web applications by allowing flexible and expanded exploration of some key products underpinning 
the assessment (including extreme indices and climatic impact-drivers).* This provides a transparent 
interface for access to authoritative IPCC results, facilitating their use in applications and climate services. 
The Interactive Atlas implements FAIR principles and builds on open tools and therefore is an important step 
towards making IPCC results more reproducible and reusable. {Section Atlas.2 and Interactive Atlas} 



# Atlas.1 Introduction 
 
## Atlas.1.1  Purpose 
 
The Atlas is the final chapter of this Working Group I (WGI) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) and comprises 
the Atlas Chapter and an online interactive tool, the Interactive Atlas. The Atlas assesses fundamental 
aspects of observed, attributed and projected changes in regional climate in coordination with other WGI 
chapters (Chapters 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12). In particular, it provides analyses and assessments of regional 
changes in mean climate (specifically surface temperature, precipitation and some cryospheric variables, 
such as snow cover and surface mass balance) and expands on and integrates results from other chapters 
across different spatial and temporal scales. The Atlas considers multiple lines of evidence including 
assessment of different global and regional observational datasets, attribution of observed trends and 
multiple model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects CMIP5 (Taylor et al., 2012a) 
and CMIP6 (Eyring et al., 2016; O’Neill et al., 2016), and the COordinated Regional Downscaling 
EXperiment (CORDEX) (Gutowski Jr. et al., 2016). The Atlas chapter also assesses model performance and 
summarizes cross-referenced findings from other chapters relevant for the different regions. 
 
The Interactive Atlas allows for a flexible spatial and temporal analysis of the results presented in the Atlas 
and other Chapters, supporting and expanding on their assessments. In particular, the Interactive Atlas 
includes information from global observational datasets (and paleoclimate information) assessed in Chapter 
2, and projections of relevant extreme indices (used in Chapter 11) and climatic impact-drivers (used in 
Chapter 12) allowing for a regional analysis of the results (Section Atlas.2.2). It provides information on 
climatic impact-drivers relevant to sectoral and regional chapters of the Working Group II (WGII) report, 
being informed by and complementing the work of Chapter 12 in creating a bridge to WGII. Similarly, a 
specific aim of the integration is synthesising information drawn from across multiple chapters that is 
relevant to the WGII report and the mitigation and sectoral chapters of the Working Group III (WGIII) 
report.  
 
An overview of the main components of the Atlas chapter is provided in Figure Atlas.1. The Interactive 
Atlas is described in Section Atlas.2 and is available online at [https://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch/](https://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch/). 
 
<figref>ATLAS.1</figref> 


## Atlas.1.2  Context and framing 
 
Information on global and regional climate change in the form of maps, tables, graphs and infographics has 
always been a key output of IPCC reports. With the consensus that climate has changed and will continue to 
do so, policymakers are focusing more on understanding its implications, which often requires an increase in 
regional and temporal details of observed and future climate. The WGI contribution of the AR5 included a 
globally comprehensive coverage of land regions and some oceanic regions in the Atlas of Global and 
Regional Climate Projections (IPCC, 2013a), focusing on projected changes in temperature and 
precipitation. In the WGII contribution, Chapter 21, Regional Context (Hewitson et al., 2014) included 
continental scale maps of observed and future temperature and precipitation changes, subcontinental changes 
in high percentiles of daily temperature and precipitation, and a table of changes in extremes over 
subcontinental regions (updating an assessment in the Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme 
Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation; SREX). However, there was only limited 
coordination between these two contributions despite the largely common data sources and their relevance 
across the two working groups and to wider communities of climate change-related policy and practice. This 
resulted in inefficiencies and the potential for confusing or inconsistent information. The Atlas, with its links 
with other WGI/II/III chapters, has been designed to help address this. 
 
Given the aims of the Atlas, there are several important factors to consider. There is a clear requirement for 
climate change information over a wide range of ‘regions’, and classes thereof, and temporal scales. There is 
also often the need for integrated information relevant for policy, practice and awareness raising. However, 
most other chapters in WGI are disciplinary, focusing on specific processes in the climate system or on its 
past or future behaviour, and have limited space to be spatially and temporally comprehensive. The Atlas 
provides an opportunity to facilitate this integration and exploration of information. 
 
Developing this information often requires a broad range of data sources (various observations, global and 
regionally downscaled baselines and projections) to be analysed and combined and, where appropriate, 
reconciled. This is a topic which is assessed from a methodological perspective in Chapter 10 using a limited 
set of examples (see also Cross-Chapter Box 10.3). The Atlas then builds on this work with a more 
comprehensive treatment of the available results, largely (but not exclusively) based on CMIP5, CMIP6, and 
CORDEX, to provide wider coverage and to further demonstrate techniques and issues. These multiple lines 
of evidence are integrated in the Interactive Atlas, a new AR6 WGI product described in Section Atlas.2 
allowing for flexible spatial and temporal analysis of this information with a predefined granularity (e.g., 
flexible seasons, regions, and baselines and future periods of analysis including time-slices and warming 
levels).  
 
Generating information relevant to policy or practice requires understanding the context of the systems that 
they focus on. In addition to the hazards these systems face, their vulnerability and exposure, and the related 
socio-economic and other physical drivers, also need to be understood. To ensure this relevance, the Atlas is 
informed by the assessments in Chapter 12 and the regional and thematic chapters and cross-chapter papers 
of WGII. Therefore, it focuses on generating information on climatic impact-drivers and hazards applicable 
to assessing impacts on and risks to human and ecological systems whilst noting the potential relevance of 
these to related contexts such as the Sustainable Development Goals and the Sendai Framework for Disaster 
Risk Reduction. 
 
Transparency and reproducibility are promoted in the Atlas chapter implementing FAIR principles for 
Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability of data (Wilkinson et al., 2016). More 
specifically, the Interactive Atlas provides full metadata of the displayed products (describing both the 
underlying datasets and the applied postprocessing) and most of the figures included in the Atlas chapter can 
be reproduced using the scripts and data provided in the WGI-Atlas repository (see Iturbide et al., 2021 and 
https://github.com/IPCC-WG1/Atlas). 
 
 
## Atlas.1.3  Defining temporal and spatial scales and regions 
 
Over the past decades scientists have engaged in a wide array of investigations aimed at quantifying and 
understanding the state of the components of the land surface-ocean-atmosphere system, the complex nature 
of their interactions and impacts over different temporal and spatial scales. As a result, a great deal has been 
learned about the importance of an appropriate choice of these scales when estimating changes due to 
internal climate variability, trends, characterization of the spatiotemporal variability and quantifying the 
range of and establishing confidence in climate projections. It is therefore important to be able to explore a 
whole range of spatial and temporal scales and this section presents the basic definitions of those, and the 
domains of analysis, used by the Atlas accounting for potential synergies between WGI and WGII.  
 
 
### Atlas.1.3.1  Baselines and temporal scales of analysis for projections across scenarios  
 
Chapter 1 has extensively explored this topic in Section 1.4.1 and Cross-Chapter Box 1.2. A summary of the 
main points relevant to the Atlas chapter and the Interactive Atlas are provided here.  

There is no standard baseline in the literature although the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) 
recommends a 30-year baseline approach such as the climate normal period 1981–2010. However, it retains 
the 1961–1990 period as the historical baseline for the sake of supporting long-term climate change 
assessments (WMO, 2017). Using the WMO standards also provides sample sizes relevant to calculating 
changes in statistics other than the mean. The AR6 WGI has established the 1995–2014 period as recent past 
baseline period – for similar reasons to the 1986–2005 period used in AR5 WGI (IPCC, 2013b) – since 2014 
(2005) is the final year of the historical simulations of the models (more details in Cross-Chapter Box 1.2). 
 
The choice of a baseline can significantly influence the analysis results for future changes in mean climate 
(Hawkins and Sutton, 2016) (Cross-Chapter Box 1.2) as well as its variability and extremes. Thus, assessing 
the sensitivity of results to the baseline period is important. The Interactive Atlas (see Section Atlas.2) allows 
users to explore and investigate a wide range of different baseline periods when analysing changes for future 
time-slices or global warming levels: 
- 1995–2014 period (AR6 20-year baseline), 
- 1986–2005 period (AR5 20-year baseline), 
- 1981–2010 period (WMO 30-year climate normal), 
- 1961–1990 period (WMO 30-year long-term climate normal). 
- 1850–1900 period (baseline used in the calculation of global warming levels). 

This promotes cross-Working Group consistency and facilitates comparability with previous reports and 
across datasets. For instance, the AR5 and long-term WMO baselines facilitate the intercomparison of 
CMIP5, CORDEX and CMIP6 projections since all have historical simulations in these periods. Using more 
recent baselines introduces discontinuity for the CMIP5 and CORDEX models, since historical simulations 
end in 2005. A pragmatic approximation to deal with this issue is to use scenario data to fill the missing 
segment, for example for 2006 to 2014 use the first years of RCP8.5-driven transient projections in which 
the emissions are close to those observed. This approach is used in the Atlas chapter and Chapter 12.  
 
When assessing changes over the recent past, many studies analyse datasets using a range of climatologically 
significant periods (i.e., 30 years or more) with precise start and end dates depending on data availability and 
the year of the study. To account for this, when generating assessments from this literature the term ‘recent 
decades’ is used to refer to a period of approximately 30 to 40 years which ends within the period 2010–2020.
An equivalent approximate description using specific years would be ‘since the 1980s’. 
 
Regarding the future reference periods, the Interactive Atlas presents projected global and regional climate 
changes at near-, mid- and long-term periods, respectively 2021–2040, 2041–2060 and 2081–2100, for a 
range of emissions scenarios (Section Atlas.1.4.3, Cross-Chapter Box 1.4). 
 
 
### Atlas.1.3.2  Global warming levels 
 
Noting the approach taken in the recent IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) above 
1850–1900 levels (IPCC, 2018b), the Atlas also presents global and regional climate change information at 
different Global Warming Levels (GWLs, see Cross-Chapter Box 11.1). In particular, to provide policy-
relevant climate information and represent the range of outcomes from the emissions scenario and time 
periods considered, GWLs of 1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C and 4°C are considered. The information is computed from all 
available scenarios (e.g. only 1.5°C and 2°C GWL information can be computed from projections under the 
SSP1-2.6 scenario). The Interactive Atlas allows comparison of timings for global warming across the 
different scenarios and of spatial patterns of change, for example information at 2°C GWL is calculated from 
SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 projections (Section 4.2.4). 
 
To calculate GWL information for the datasets used in the Atlas (CMIP6 and CMIP5; see Section Atlas.1.4), 
this chapter adopted the procedure used in Cross-Chapter Box 11.1. A model future climate simulation 
reaches the defined GWL of 1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C or 4°C when its global near-surface air temperature change 
averaged over successive 20-year periods first attains that level of warming relative to its simulation of the 
1851-1900 climate. (1851–1900 defines the pre-industrial baseline period for calculating the required global 
surface temperature baseline, Cross-Chapter Box 1.2). Note that this process is different from the one used in 
the SR1.5 report which used 30-year future periods. If a projection stabilizes before reaching the required 
threshold it is unable to simulate climate at that GWL and is thus discarded. For CORDEX simulations, the 
periods of the driving GCM are used, as in Nikulin et al. (2018). Detailed reproducible information on the 
GWLs used in the Atlas is provided in the Atlas repository (Iturbide et al., 2021). 
 
Climate information at many temporal scales and over a wide range of temporal averaging periods is 
required for the assessment of climate change and its implications. These range from annual to multi-decadal 
averages required to characterise low-frequency variability and trends in climate to hourly or instantaneous 
maximum or minimum values of impactful climate variables. In between, information on, for example, 
seasonal rainfall is important and implies the need to include averaging periods whose relevance are 
geographically dependent. As a result, the Atlas chapter presents results over a wide range of timescales, 
from daily to decadal, and averaging periods with the Interactive Atlas allowing a choice of user-defined 
seasons and a range of predefined daily to multi-day climate indices. 
 
 
### Atlas.1.3.3  Spatial scales and reference regions 
 
Many factors influence the spatial scales and regions over which climate information is required and can be 
reliably generated. Despite all efforts in researching, analysing and understanding climate and climate 
change, a key factor in determining spatial scales at which analysis can be undertaken is the availability and 
reliability of data, both observational and from model simulations. In addition, information is required over a 
wide range of spatial domains defined either from a climatological or geographical perspective (e.g., a region 
affected by monsoon rainfall or a river basin) or from a socio-economic or political perspective (e.g., least-
developed countries or nation states). Chapter 1 provides an overview of these topics (Section 1.5.2). This 
subsection discusses some relevant issues, summarizes recent advances in defining domains and spatial 
scales used by AR6 analyses and how these can be explored with the Interactive Atlas. 
 
Recent IPCC reports – AR5 Chapter 14 (Christensen et al., 2013) and SR1.5 Chapter 3 (Hoegh-Guldberg et 
al., 2018) – have summarized information on projected future climate changes over subcontinental regions 
defined in the SREX report (Seneviratne et al., 2012) and later extended in the AR5 from the 26 regions in 
SREX to include the polar, Caribbean, two Indian Ocean, and three Pacific Ocean regions (hereafter known 
as the AR5 WGI reference regions) (Figure Atlas.2a). In recent literature, new subregions have been used, 
for example for North and South America, Africa and Central America, together with the new definition of 
reference oceanic regions. Iturbide et al. (2020) describes an updated version of the reference regions which 
is used in this report (hereafter known as AR6 WGI reference regions) and is shown in Figure Atlas.2b. The 
goal of these subsequent revisions was to improve the climatic consistency of the regions so they represented 
sub-continental areas of greater climatic coherency. 
 
<figref>ATLAS.2</figref> 
 
The rationale followed for the definition of the reference regions was guided by two basic principles: 1) 
climatic consistency and better representation of regional climate features and 2) representativeness of model 
results (i.e., sufficient number of model grid boxes). The finer resolution of CMIP6 models (as compared, on 
average, to CMIP5) yields better model representation of the reference regions allowing them to be revised 
for better climatic consistency (e.g., dividing heterogeneous regions) while preserving the model 
representation. Figure Atlas.3 illustrates this issue displaying the number of grid boxes (over land for land 
regions) in the AR6 reference regions for two Interactive Atlas reference grids of horizontal resolutions of 1° 
and 2°, representative of the typical resolution of CMIP6 and CMIP5 models respectively. This figure shows 
that the new reference regions are well suited for the assessment of model results, with poorest model 
coverage for the New Zealand (NZ), Caribbean (CAR) and Madagascar (MAD) regions. 
 
<figref>ATLAS.3</figref>
 
AR6 WGI (land and open ocean) reference regions are used in the Interactive Atlas as the default 
regionalization for atmospheric variables. However, these regions are not optimum for the analysis of 
oceanic variables since, for instance, the five upwelling regions (Canary, California, Peru, Benguela and 
Somali) are mostly included in ‘land’ regions. Therefore, the alternative set of oceanic regions defined by 
their biological activity (Figure Atlas.4) is used in the Interactive Atlas for the regional analysis of oceanic 
variables (see Fay and McKinley, 2014; Gregor et al., 2019). Due to the many potential definitions of the 
regions relevant for WGI and WGII, some additional typological and socio-economic regions have also been 
included in the Interactive Atlas.  
 
 
### Atlas.1.3.4  Typological and socio-economic regions 
 
In addition to contiguous spatial domains discussed in the previous section, some domains are defined by 
specific climatological, geographical, ecological or socio-economic properties where climate is an important 
determinant or influencer. In these cases the domains are subject to particular physical processes that are 
important for its climatology or that involve systems affected by the climate in a way that observations and 
climate model simulations can be used to understand. Many of these are the basis of the chapters and cross-
chapter papers of the AR6 WGII report, namely river basins, biodiversity hotspots, tropical forests, cities, 
coastal settlements, deserts and semi-arid areas, the Mediterranean, mountains and polar regions. It is 
therefore important to generate climate information relevant to these typological domains and some 
examples of these used in the Interactive Atlas are shown in Figure Atlas.4.

## Atlas.1.4  Combining multiple sources of information for regions 
 
This section introduces the observational data sources and reanalyses that are used in the assessment of 
regional climate change and for evaluating and bias-adjusting the results of models (more information on 
observational reference datasets is available in Annex I). It also introduces the different global and regional 
climate model outputs that are used for regional climate assessment considering both historical and future 
climate projections (Annex II). Many of these models are run as part of coordinated Model Intercomparison 
Projects (MIPs), including CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX, described below. Combining information from 
these multiple data sources is a significant challenge (see Section 10.5 for an in-depth treatment of the 
problem) though if they can be used to generate robust information on regional climate change it can guide 
policy and support decisions responding to these changes. An important and necessary part of this process is 
to check for consistency amongst the data sources which is discussed in the final section.  
 
### Atlas.1.4.1  Observations 
 
There are various sources of observational information available for global and regional analysis. 
Observational uncertainty is a key factor when assessing and attributing historical trends, so assessment 
should build on integrated analyses from different datasets (disparity, inadequacy and contradictions in 
existing datasets are assessed in Section 10.2). The Atlas chapter can supplement and complement Chapter 
10 by providing the opportunity to visualise and expand on its assessment. This includes displaying maps of 
density of stations observations (including those that are used in the different datasets) and assessing 
observational uncertainty by using multiple datasets. 
 
Two of the most commonly used variables in climate studies are gridded surface air temperature and 
precipitation. There are many datasets available (Annex I) and Chapter 2 provides an assessment of key 
global datasets, including blended land-air and sea-surface temperature datasets to assess Global Mean 
Surface Temperature (GMST). The Atlas analyses separately atmospheric and oceanic variables and for the 
former a number of common global datasets supporting the assessment done in other chapters is used, 
including those selected in Chapter 2, but considering land-only information for the blended products. In 
particular, for air temperature the Atlas uses CRUTEM5 – the land component of the HadCRUT5 dataset – 
(Osborn et al., 2021), Berkeley Earth (Rohde and Hausfather, 2020) and the Climatic Research Unit CRU 
TS4 (version 4.04 used here) (Harris et al., 2020). For precipitation the Atlas includes CRU TS4, the Global 
Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC, v2018 used here) (Schneider et al., 2011), and Global Precipitation 
Climatology Project (GPCP; monthly version 2.3 used here) (Adler et al., 2018). Although the ultimate 
source of these datasets is surface station reported values (GPCP also includes satellite information), each 
has access to different numbers of stations and lengths of records and employs different ways of creating the 
gridded product and ensuring quality control. For oceanic variables, the most widely used sea surface 
temperature (SST) datasets are HadSST4 (Kennedy et al., 2019), which is the oceanic component of the 
HadCRUT5 dataset, ERSST (Huang et al., 2017a), and KaplanSST (Kaplan et al., 1998).  
 
Figure Atlas.5 shows the spatial coverage of the total number of observation stations for different periods 
(1901–1910, 1971–1980, and 2001–2010) for two illustrative datasets: the CRU TS4.0 dataset for 
precipitation and the SST data in HadSST4. The former illustrates spatially the declining trend of station 
observation data used in the precipitation datasets for certain regions (South America, Africa) after the 
1990s. This demonstrates the regional inhomogeneity and temporal change in station density, which is in 
part a consequence of many stations not reporting to the WMO networks and their data being held 
domestically or regionally. During early years a limited number of observations are available. This 
information is used in the Interactive Atlas to blank out regions not constrained with observations in those 
datasets providing station density information.  

<figref>ATLAS.5</figref> 
 
In addition to surface observations, satellites have been widely used to produce rainfall estimates. The 
advantage of satellite-based rainfall products is their global coverage including remote areas but there is 
significant uncertainty in these products over complex terrain (Rahmawati and Lubczynski, 2018; Satgé et 
al., 2019). Another recent development has been on gridded datasets for climate extremes based on surface 
stations, such as HadEX3 (Dunn et al., 2020).  
 
There are some studies assessing observational datasets globally (Beck et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2018b) and 
regionally (Manzanas et al., 2014; Salio et al., 2015; Prakash, 2019), reporting large differences among them 
and stressing the importance of considering observational uncertainty in regional climate assessment studies. 
Uncertainty in observations is also a key limitation for the evaluation of climate models, particularly over 
regions with low station density (Kalognomou et al., 2013; Kotlarski et al., 2019). More detailed information 
on these issues is provided in Section 10.2. 
 
For regional studies, observational datasets with global coverage are complemented by a range of regional 
observational analyses and gridded products, such as E-OBS (Cornes et al., 2018) over Europe, Daymet 
(Thornton et al., 2016) over North America, or APHRODITE (Yatagai et al., 2012) over Asia. These are 
highlighted in various other chapters and the Atlas expands on their treatment, complementing discussions 
on discrepancies/conflicts in observations presented in Chapter 10 and expanding on and replicating their 
results for other regions. In particular, the Interactive Atlas includes the global and regional observational 
products described here to assess observational uncertainty over the different regions analysed. 
 
 
### Atlas.1.4.2  Reanalysis 
 
There are currently many atmospheric reanalysis datasets with different spatial resolution and assimilation 
algorithms (see Annex I and Section 1.5.2). There are also substantial differences among these datasets due 
to the types of observations assimilated into the reanalyses, the assimilation techniques that are used, and the 
resolution of the outputs, amongst other reasons. For example, 20CR (Slivinski et al., 2019) only assimilates 
surface pressure and sea surface temperature to achieve the longest record but at relatively low resolution, 
while ERA-20C (Poli et al., 2016) only assimilates surface pressure and surface marine winds. At the other 
extreme, very sophisticated assimilation systems using multiple surface, upper air and Earth observation data 
sources are employed, for example ERA5 (Hersbach et al., 2020) and JRA-55 (Harada et al., 2016), which 
also have much higher resolutions. Most reanalysis datasets cover the entire globe, but there are also high-
resolution regional reanalysis datasets which provide further regional detail (Kaiser-Weiss et al., 2019).  
 
The Atlas and Interactive Atlas use information from ERA5 and from the bias-adjusted version WFDE5 
(Cucchi et al., 2020) which is combined with ERA5 information over the ocean and used as the ISIMIP 
observational reference dataset W5E5 (Lange, 2019b). This reference is also used in the Atlas for model 
evaluation (Section Atlas.1.4.4) and for bias-adjusting model outputs (Section Atlas.1.4.5). 
 
 
### Atlas.1.4.3  Global model data (CMIP5 and CMIP6)  
 
The Atlas chapter (and the Interactive Atlas) uses global model simulations from both CMIP5 and CMIP6, 
mainly historical and future projections performed under ScenarioMIP (O’Neill et al., 2016). This facilitates 
backwards comparability and thus the detection of new salient features and findings from recent science and 
the latest CMIP6 ensemble. The selection of the models is based on availability of scenario data for the 
variables assessed in the Atlas chapter and for those included in the Interactive Atlas (Section Atlas.2.2). In 
particular, in order to harmonize the results obtained from the different scenarios as much as possible, only 
models providing data for the historical scenario and at least two emission scenarios, RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and/or 
RCP8.5 (for CMIP5) and SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and/or SSP5-8.5 (for CMIP6), were chosen, 
resulting in 29 and 35 models, respectively (see Cross-Chapter Box 1.4 for a description of the scenarios). In 
the Atlas chapter (similarly to the regional Chapters 11 and 12) a single simulation is taken from each model 
(see Section Atlas.12 for limitations of this choice). Since the RCP and SSP emission scenarios are not 
directly comparable due to different regional forcing (Section 4.2.2), the Atlas includes Global Warming 
Levels (GWLs) as an alternative dimension of analysis (see Cross-Chapter Box 11.1), which allows 
intercomparison of results from different scenarios as an alternative to the standard analysis based on time-
slices for particular scenarios (Section Atlas.1.3.1). This dimension allows for enhanced comparability of 
CMIP5 and CMIP6, since it constrains the regional patterns to the same global warming level for both 
datasets. 
 
Building on this information, the Interactive Atlas displays a number of (mean and extreme) indices and 
climatic impact-drivers (CIDs) considering both atmospheric and oceanic variables (see Section Atlas.2.2). 
Some of these indices have been selected in coordination with Chapters 11 and 12, in order to support and 
extend the assessment performed in these chapters (see Annex VI for details on the indices). In order to 
harmonize this information, the indices have been computed for each individual model on the original model 
grids and the results have been interpolated to a common 2° (for CMIP5) and 1° (CMIP6) horizontal 
resolution grids. In addition, for the sake of comparability with CMIP6 results (in particular when using 
baselines going beyond 2005), the historical period of the CMIP5 and CORDEX datasets has been extended 
to 2006–2014 using the first years of RCP8.5-driven transient projections (see Section Atlas.1.3.1). Tables 
listing the CMIP5 and CMIP6 models used in the Atlas and in the Interactive Atlas for different scenarios 
and variables are included as Supplementary Material (Tables Atlas.SM.1 and Atlas.SM.2, respectively); 
moreover, full inventories including details on the specific ESGF versions are given in the Atlas GitHub 
repository  (Iturbide et al., 2021). 
 
Chapter 3 and Flato et al. (2013) describe the evaluation of CMIP6 and CMIP5 models, respectively, 
assessing surface variables and large-scale indicators. Section 10.3.3, assesses the general capability of 
GCMs to produce climate output for regions. 
 
Information from the existing CMIP5 and CMIP6 datasets is supplemented with downscaled regional 
climate simulations from CORDEX. This facilitates an assessment of the effects from higher resolution 
including whether this modifies the projected climate change signals compared to global models and adds 
any value, especially in terms of high-resolution features and extremes. 
 
 
### Atlas.1.4.4  Regional model data (CORDEX) 
 
Global model data, as generated by the CMIP ensembles, although available globally, have spatial 
resolutions that are limited for reproducing certain processes and phenomena relevant for regional analysis 
(around 2° and 1° for CMIP5 and CMIP6, respectively). The Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling 
Experiment (CORDEX) (Gutowski Jr. et al., 2016) facilitates worldwide application of Regional Climate 
Models (RCMs, see Section 10.3.1.2), focusing on a number of regions (see Figure Atlas.6) with a typical 
resolution of 0.44° (but also at 0.22° and 0.11° over some domains, such as Europe). However, only a few 
simulations are available for some domains (Annex II, Tables AII.1 and AII.2), thus limiting the level of 
analysis and assessment that can be performed using CORDEX data in some regions. Moreover, there are 
regions where several domains overlap, thus providing additional lines of evidence. The use of multi-domain 
grand ensembles to work globally with CORDEX data have recently been proposed (Legasa et al., 2020; 
Spinoni et al., 2020). Ongoing efforts, such as the multi-domain CORDEX-CORE simulations are promoting 
more homogeneous coverage and thus more systematic treatment of CORDEX domains (see Box Atlas.1). 

<figref>ATLAS.6</figref> 
 
A lot of progress has been made by the regional climate modelling community since AR5 (Table AII.2) to 
produce and make available evaluation (reanalysis-driven) simulations over the different CORDEX domains 
along with downscaled CMIP5 historical and future climate projection information under a range of emission 
scenarios, mainly RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (Tables AII.3 and AII.4). However, these ensembles cover 
only a fraction of the uncertainty range spanned by the full CMIP5 ensemble in the different domains (e.g., 
Ito et al., 2020b), Figure Atlas.16, Figure Atlas.17, Figure Atlas.21, Figure Atlas.22, Figure Atlas.24, Figure 
Atlas.26, Figure Atlas.28 and Figure Atlas.29). Therefore, comparison of CMIP5 and CORDEX results 
should be performed carefully, providing results not only for the full CMIP5 ensemble but also for the sub-
ensemble formed by the driving models since results can diverge (Fernández et al., 2019; Iles et al., 2020).  
 
The Atlas chapter and the Interactive Atlas use CORDEX information for the following eleven individual 
CORDEX domains (out of the fourteen domains shown in Figure Atlas.6): Northern, Central and South 
America, Europe, Africa, South, East and Southeast Asia, Australasia, Arctic and Antarctica; in addition, 
oceanic information has been used from the Mediterranean domain, which provides simulations from 
coupled atmosphere-ocean regional climate models. In order to harmonize the information across domains 
and to maximize the size of the resulting ensembles, all the available simulations for each individual 
CORDEX domain (including the standard 0.44° CORDEX and the 0.22° CORDEX-CORE) have been 
interpolated to a common regular 0.5°-resolution grid to provide a grand ensemble covering the historical 
and future emission RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, and also the reanalysis-driven simulations for 
evaluation purposes. In the case of the European domain, the dataset considered is the 0.11° simulations 
(CORDEX EUR-11, the same dataset as used in Chapter 12) which has been interpolated to a regular 0.25° 
resolution grid (the same used for the regional observations). In the case of the Mediterranean domain, 
oceanic information (sea surface temperature) is interpolated to a regular 0.11º grid. In all cases, the indices 
are computed on the original grids and the interpolation process is applied to the resulting indices. Moreover, 
for the sake of comparability with CMIP6 results (in particular when using baseline periods beyond 2005), 
the historical period of the CORDEX datasets has been extended to 2006–2014 using the first years of 
RCP8.5-driven transient projections in which the emissions are close to those observed (see Section 
Atlas.1.3.1); note that this procedure is also applied to CMIP5 simulations.  
 
For the different CORDEX domains, the full ensembles of models (GCM-RCM matrix) used in the Atlas for 
the different scenarios and variables are described in the Supplementary Material (Tables Atlas.SM.3 to 
Atlas.SM.14) and in the Atlas repository (Iturbide et al., 2021), including full metadata relative to ESGF 
versions used and the periods with data available for the different simulations. In particular, the historical 
scenario information is only available from 1970 onwards for some models and therefore the common period 
1970–2005 is used for historical CORDEX data in the Atlas. As a result, the WMO baseline period 1961–
1990 is not available in the Interactive Atlas for CORDEX data. 
 
Sections Atlas.4 to Atlas.11 assess research on CORDEX simulations over different regions, analysing past 
and present climate as well as future climate projections. They also focus on regional model evaluation in 
order to extend and complement the validation of global models done in Chapter 3, considering the specific 
regional climate and relevant large-scale and regional phenomena, drivers and feedbacks (Section 10.3.3). 
Besides the literature assessment, some simple evaluation diagnostics have been computed for the 
simulations used in the Atlas chapter to provide some basic information on model performance across 
regions. In particular biases for mean temperature and precipitation have been calculated for the eleven 
CORDEX domains analysed. 

Figure Atlas.7 shows mean temperature and precipitation biases over the North American domain in RCM 
simulations driven by reanalysis and historical GCM simulations (see Section 10.3.2.5). Annual and seasonal 
(DJF and JJA) biases are computed for both the RCMs and driving GCMs. Biases in the reanalysis-driven 
RCMs result from intrinsic model errors, with the results displayed being spatially aggregated for each 
reference region. This same analysis is performed for the GCM-driven RCM simulations over the historical 
period 1986–2005. This allows comparison of the intrinsic bias of the RCMs with the biases resulting when 
driven by the different GCMs and patterns of behaviour in the RCMs, for example intrinsic warm and dry 
biases in ENA and WNA respectively or reduced RCM warm biases compared to the CCCma GCM in NEN 
and ENA. Similar results for the other CORDEX domains are included as Supplementary Material (Figures 
Atlas.SM.1 to Atlas.SM.10). 
 
<figref>ATLAS.7</figref> 
 
<boxref>Box ATLAS.1</boxref> 
 
### Atlas.1.4.5  Bias adjustment 
 
Bias adjustment is often applied to data from climate model simulations to improve their applicability for 
assessing climate impacts and risk (for instance in the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project, 
ISIMIP (Rosenzweig et al., 2017). Bias-adjustment approaches (Section 10.3.1.3) are particularly beneficial 
when threshold-based indices are used, but they can introduce other biases, in particular when applied 
directly to coarse-resolution GCMs (Cross-Chapter Box 10.2). Bias-adjustment techniques should be chosen 
carefully for a particular application. In the Atlas, bias adjustment is not applied systematically (in particular 
it is not applied for the variables assessed in the Atlas chapter), and only the threshold-dependent extreme 
indices and climatic impact-drivers (CIDs) included in the Interactive Atlas are bias-adjusted (in particular 
frost days, and TX35, TX40 in coordination with Chapter 12). To facilitate integration with WGII, the Atlas 
uses the same bias-adjustment method as in ISIMIP3 (Lange, 2019a) and the same observational reference 
(W5E5, see Section Atlas.1.4.2), upscaled to the same resolution as the model to avoid downscaling artefacts 
(Cross-Chapter Box 10.2). The ISIMIP3 bias-adjustment method is a trend-preserving approach that is 
recommended for general applications, as it reduces biases while preserving the original climate change 
signal (Casanueva et al., 2020). Following the recommendations given in Chapter 10, results in the 
Interactive Atlas are displayed for both the adjusted and the raw model output.

# Atlas.2  The online ‘Interactive Atlas’ 
 
The WGI Interactive Atlas is a new AR6 product developed as part of the Atlas in consultation with other 
chapters to facilitate flexible synthesis information for regions, and to support the Technical Summary (TS) 
and the Summary for Policymakers (SPM), as well as the handshake with WGII. It includes multiple lines of 
evidence to support the assessment of observed and projected climate change by offering information for 
regions using both time-slices across scenarios and Global Warming Levels (GWLs). Coordination has been 
established with other chapters (particularly the regional chapters) adopting their methodological 
recommendations (Chapter 10) and using common datasets and agreed extreme indices and climatic impact-
drivers (CIDs) to support and expand their assessment (Chapters 11 and 12).  
 
The Interactive Atlas allows for flexible spatial and temporal analysis (Section Atlas.1.3) with a predefined 
granularity (predefined climatological and typological regions and user-defined seasons) through a wide 
range of maps, graphs and tables generated in an interactive manner building on a collection of global and 
regional observational datasets and climate projections (including CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX; Section 
Atlas.1.4). In particular, the Interactive Atlas provides trends and changes for observations and projections in 
the form of interactive maps for predefined historical and future periods of analysis, the former including 
recent-past and paleoclimate (see Cross-Chapter Box 2.1) and the latter including future time-slices (near, 
medium and long term) across scenarios (RCPs and SSPs; see Cross-Chapter Box 1.4) and GWLs (1.5°C, 
2°C, 3°C and 4°C; see Cross-Chapter Box 11.1). It also provides regional information (aggregated spatial 
values) for a number of predefined (reference and typological) regions in the form of time series, annual 
cycle plots, scatter plots (e.g., temperature versus precipitation), table summaries, and ensemble and seasonal 
stripe plots. This allows for a comprehensive analysis (and intercomparison, particularly using GWLs as a 
dimension of integration) of the different datasets at a global and regional scale.  
 
The Interactive Atlas can be consulted online at http://ipcc-atlas.ifca.es. Figure Atlas.8 illustrates the main 
functionalities available: the controls at the top of the window allow the interactive selection of the dataset, 
variable, period (reference and baseline) and season which define a particular product of interest (e.g., annual 
temperature change from CMIP6 under SSP3-7.0 for the long-term 2081–2100 period relative to 1995–2104 
in this illustrative case). Regionally aggregated information can be obtained interactively by clicking on one 
or several subregions on the map and by selecting one of the several options available for visuals (time 
series, annual-cycle plots, scatter and stripe plots) and tables. 
 
 
<figref>ATLAS.8</figref> 
 
A major goal during the development of the Interactive Atlas has been ensuring transparency and 
reproducibility of results, and promoting open science and Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and 
Reuse (FAIR) principles (Wilkinson et al., 2016) described in Atlas.2.3. As a result, full metadata are 
provided in the Interactive Atlas for each of the products, and the scripts used to generate the intermediated 
products (e.g., extreme indices and CIDs) and figures are available online in a public repository (Iturbide et 
al., 2021), which also includes simple notebooks illustrating key parts of the code suitable for reusability. 
These scripts are based on the climate4R open-source framework (Iturbide et al., 2019) and full metadata 
have been generated for all final products using the METACLIP framework (Bedia et al., 2019), which 
builds on standards and describes provenance of the datasets as well as the post-processing workflow.  
 
 
## Atlas.2.1  Why an interactive online Atlas in AR6? 
 
The idea of an interactive online Atlas was first discussed in the IPCC Expert Meeting on Assessing Climate 
Information for the Regions (IPCC, 2018a). The meeting stressed the need for the AR6 regional Atlas to go 
beyond the AR5 experience in supporting and expanding the assessment of key variables/indices and 
datasets conducted in all chapters, ensuring traceability, and facilitating the ‘handshake’ between WGI and 
WGII. One of the main limitations of previous products, including the AR5 WGI Atlas (IPCC, 2013a), is 
their static nature with inherent limited options and flexibility to provide comprehensive regional climate 
information for different regions and applications. For instance, the use of standard seasons limits the 
assessment in many cases, such as regions affected by monsoons or seasonal rainband migrations or other 
phenomena-driven seasons. The limited number of variables which can be treated on a printed Atlas also 
prevents the inclusion of relevant extreme indices and CIDs. The development of an online Interactive Atlas 
for AR6 was proposed as a solution to overcome these obstacles, facilitating the flexible exploration of key 
variables/indices and datasets assessed in all chapters through a wide range of maps, graphs and tables 
generated in an interactive manner, and thus also providing support to the TS and SPM. One of the main 
concerns raised by this new online interactive product was the potential danger of having an unmanageable 
number of final products impossible to assess following the IPCC review process. This was addressed by 
designing the Interactive Atlas with limited and predefined functionality and granularity thus facilitating the 
review process and including use of open-source tools and code for traceability and reproducibility of results.  
 
 
## Atlas.2.2  Description of the Interactive Atlas: functionalities and datasets  
 
The Interactive Atlas builds on the work done in the context of the Spanish National Adaptation Plan 
(PNACC – AdapteCCa; http://escenarios.adaptecca.es) to develop an interactive online application 
centralizing and providing key regional climate change information to assist the Spanish climate change 
impact and adaptation community. The functionalities included in the AR6 WGI Interactive Atlas are an 
evolution of those implemented in AdapteCCa and have been adapted and extended to cope with the 
particular requirements of the datasets and functionalities it includes. In particular, the Interactive Atlas 
allows analysis of global and regional information on past trends and future climate changes through a wide 
range of maps, graphs and tables generated in an interactive manner and building on six basic products (see 
Figure Atlas.8):  

1.  Global maps of variables averaged over time-slices across scenarios and GWLs, with robustness 
represented using the approaches described in Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1. 

2.  Temporal series, displaying all individual ensemble members and the multi-model mean, with 
robustness represented as ranges across the ensemble (25th–75th and 10th–90th percentile ranges). 
The selected reference period of analysis is also displayed as context information, either a time-slice 
(near-, mid- or long-term) or a GWL (defined for a given model as the first 20-year period where its 
average surface temperature change first reaches the GWL relative to its 1850–1900 temperature).  

3.  Annual cycle plots representing individual models, the multi-model mean and ranges across the 
ensemble.  

4.  Stripe and seasonal stripe plots, providing visual information on changes across the ensemble 
(different models in rows with the multi-model mean on the top) and across seasons (months in 
rows, using the signal from the multi-model mean), respectively.  

5.  Two-variable scatter plots (e.g., temperature versus precipitation). 

6.  Tables with summary information. 
 
The first of these products provides spatial information about the ensemble mean, while the latter five 
convey (spatially) aggregated information of the multi-model ensemble for particular region(s) selected by 
the user from a number of predefined alternatives (see Sections Atlas.1.3.3 and Atlas.1.3.4 for reference and 
typological regions, respectively).  
 
The Interactive Atlas includes both atmospheric (daily mean, minimum and maximum temperatures, 
precipitation, snowfall and wind) and oceanic (sea surface temperature, pH, sea ice, and sea level rise) 
essential variables assessed in the Atlas chapter and Chapters 4, 8 and 9, as well as some derived extreme 
indices used in Chapter 11 and a selection of CIDs used in Chapter 12 (see Annex VI): 

- Maximum of maximum temperatures (TXx) – see Chapter 11. 
- Minimum of minimum temperatures (TNn) – see Chapter 11. 
- Maximum 1-day precipitation (RX1day) – see Chapter 11. 
- Maximum 5-day precipitation (RX5day) – see Chapter 11. 
- Consecutive Dry Days (CDD) – see Chapter 11. 
- Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI-6) – see Chapters 11 and 12. 
- Frost days (FD), both raw and bias adjusted – see Chapters 11 and 12. 
- Heating Degree Days (HD) – see Chapter 12. 
- Cooling Degree Days (CD) – see Chapter 12. 
- Days with maximum temperature above 35°C (TX35), both raw and bias adjusted – see Chapter 12. 
- Days with maximum temperature above 40°C (TX40), both raw and bias adjusted – see Chapter 12. 

The essential variables are computed for observations and reanalysis datasets as described in Sections 
Atlas.1.4.1 and Atlas.1.4.2 (note that the Atlas does not include observational datasets for extremes). Trend 
analyses are available for two alternative baseline periods (1961–2015 and 1980–2015, selected according to 
data availability). This expands the information available in Chapter 2 for global observational datasets, 
including new periods of analysis and new regional observational datasets which provide further insight into 
observational uncertainty. 
 
Both essential variables and indices/CIDs are computed for CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX model 
projections (Sections Atlas.1.4.3 and Atlas.1.4.4). The calculations are performed on the original model grids 
and results are interpolated to the reference regular grids at horizontal resolutions of 2° (CMIP5), 1° 
(CMIP6) and 0.5° (CORDEX) (Iturbide et al., 2021). Information is available for the historical, SSP1-2.6, 
SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios for CMIP6, and historical, RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 for 
CMIP5 and CORDEX, as documented in Annex II Tables 1-2 (for CMIP5/CMIP6) and Annex II Tables 3-
14 (for the different CORDEX domains). All products (maps, graphs and tables) are available for different 
reference periods of analysis, either time-slices (2021–2040, 2041–2060 and 2081–2100 for near-, mid- and 
long-term future periods, respectively; see Section Atlas.1.3.1), or GWLs (1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C or 4C; see 
Section Atlas.1.3.2), with changes relative to a number of alternative baselines (including 1850–1900 pre-
industrial, and 1995–2014 recent past; see Section Atlas.1.3.1). Note that instead of blending the information 
from the different scenarios, the Interactive Atlas allows comparison of the GWL spatial patterns and timings 
across the different scenarios (see Cross Chapter Box 11.1). 
 
Some of the above indices (in particular TX35 and TX40) are highly sensitive to model biases and the 
application of bias-adjustment techniques is recommended to alleviate this problem (see Cross-Chapter Box 
10.2). Bias adjustment is performed as explained in Section Atlas.1.4.5.  
 
The Interactive Atlas implements the approaches for representing robustness in maps at the grid-box level 
described in Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1. These approaches are not necessarily informative for assessing 
trends and climate change signals over larger spatial scales where signals are less affected by small-scale 
variability leading to an increase in robustness. For regional analysis, the Interactive Atlas allows the 
analysis of aggregated region-wide signals and assessing their robustness at a regional scale thus 
complementing the previous approach for grid-box robustness representation. For example, Figure Atlas.9 
shows large hatched areas for maximum 5-day precipitation in the South Asia region. When aggregated 
spatially, the region exhibits a robust wetting signal, with most ensemble members agreeing on the sign. This 
highlights that signals may not have emerged at the station- or grid-box scale but have clearly at aggregated 
scales, particularly for variables with high variability (e.g., extreme precipitation or cold extremes; see 
Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1).  
 
The advanced approach for representing robustness includes a new category for identifying conflicting 
signals, where models are projecting significant changes but of opposite signs. This is demonstrated in 
Figure Atlas.9 which shows a region of central Africa where models have significant changes in surface 
winds with some projecting increases and others decreases. This is clearly demonstrated in the time-series 
below the map which shows these wind-speed changes aggregated over the CAF reference region for each of 
the CMIP6 models and the opposing signals in many of these.

## Atlas.2.3  Accessibility, reproducibility and reusability (FAIR principles) 
 
The accessibility and reproducibility of scientific results have become a major concern in all scientific 
disciplines (Baker, 2016). During the design and development of the Interactive Atlas, special attention was 
paid to these issues in order to ensure the transparency of the products feeding into the Interactive Atlas 
(which are all publicly available). Accessibility is implemented in collaboration with the IPCC Data 
Distribution Centre (DDC), since all products underpinning the Interactive Atlas, including the intermediate 
products required for the indices and CIDs (monthly aggregated data), are curated and distributed by the 
IPCC-DDC and include full provenance information as part of their metadata. Atlas products are generated 
using the open source climate4R framework (Iturbide et al., 2019) for data processing (e.g. regridding, 
aggregation, index calculation, bias adjustment), evaluation and quality control (when applicable). Full 
metadata are generated for all final products using the METACLIP framework (Bedia et al., 2019), based on 
the Resource Description Framework (RDF) standard to describe the datasets and data-processing workflow. 
 
In summary, a number of actions have been conducted in order to implement open access, reproducibility 
and reusability of results, including: 

- Use of standards and open-source tools. 
- Open access to raw data and derived Atlas products via the IPCC-DDC.  
- Provision of full provenance metadata describing the product generation workflow.  
- Access to code through an online repository (Iturbide et al., 2021), including the scripts needed for 
calculating the intermediate datasets and for reproducing some of the figures of the Atlas chapter. 
- Provision of annotated (Jupyter) notebooks describing key elements of the code to provide guidance 
and facilitate reusability.  
 
All final products visualized in the Interactive Atlas can be exported in a variety of formats, including PNG 
and PDF for bitmap and vector information, respectively. Moreover, in the case of the global maps, the final 
data underlying these products can be downloaded in GIS format (GeoTIFF), thus facilitating reusability of 
the information. Note that the images are final IPCC products (covered by the IPCC terms of use), whereas 
the underlying data are distributed by the IPCC-DDC under a more flexible license which facilitates 
reusability. Moreover, a comprehensive provenance metadata description has been generated, including all 
details needed for reproducibility, from the data sources to the different post-processes applied to obtain the 
final product. In these cases, there is also the possibility to download a PNG file augmented with attached 
metadata information (in JSON format). This metadata information (including the source code generating the 
product) can be accessed and interpreted automatically using specific JSON software/libraries. However, for 
the sake of simplicity, a human-readable version of the metadata is accessible directly from the Interactive 
Atlas describing the key information along the workflow. 
 
Provenance is defined as a ‘record that describes the people, institutions, entities, and activities involved in 
producing, influencing, or delivering a piece of data or a thing’. This information can be used to form 
assessments about their quality, reliability or trustworthiness. In the context of the outcomes of the 
Interactive Atlas, having an effective way of dealing with data provenance is a necessary condition to ensure 
not only the reproducibility of results, but also to build trust on the information provided. However, the 
relative complexity of the data and the post-processing workflows involved may prevent a proper 
communication of data provenance with full details for reproducibility. Therefore, a special effort was made 
in order to build a comprehensive provenance metadata model for the Interactive Atlas products.  
 
Provenance frameworks are typically based on RDF (Resource Description Framework), a family of World 
Wide Web Consortium (W3C) specifications originally designed as a metadata model (Candan et al., 2001). 
It is an abstract model that has become a general method for conceptual description of information for the 
Web, using a variety of syntax notations and serialization formats. METACLIP (Bedia et al., 2019) exploits 
RDF through specific vocabularies, written in the OWL ontology language, describing different aspects 
involved in climate product generation, from the data source to the post-processing workflow, extending 
international standard vocabularies such as PROV-O (Moreau et al., 2015). The METACLIP vocabularies 
are publicly available in the METACLIP repository (http://github.com/metaclip/vocabularies).  
 
METACLIP emphasises the delivery of ‘final products’ (understood as any piece of information that is 
stored in a file, such as a plot or a map) with a full semantic description of its origin and meaning attached. 
METACLIP ensures ‘machine readability’ through reuse of well-defined, standard metadata vocabularies, 
providing semantic interoperability and the possibility of developing database engines supporting advanced 
provenance analytics. Therefore, this framework has been adopted to generate provenance information and 
attach it as metadata to the products generated by the Interactive Atlas. A specific vocabulary (‘ipcc_terms’) 
is created alongside the inclusion of new products in the Interactive Atlas and uses the controlled 
vocabularies existing from CMIP and CORDEX experiments. As an example, Figure Atlas.10 shows the 
semantic vocabularies needed to encode the information of the typical workflow for computing (from bias-
adjusted data) any of the climate indices (extreme or CIDs) included in the Interactive Atlas.

## Atlas.2.4  Guidance for users  
 
### Atlas.2.4.1  Purpose of the Interactive Atlas 
 
The primary purpose of the IPCC is to provide a policy relevant, non-prescriptive assessment of the state of 
knowledge on climate change and its impacts. This purpose is different from the provision of information 
targeted to implement climate policies, which is the focus of climate services and national climate change 
assessment communities. IPCC assessments are based on quantitative observational and model-generated 
data that are also used in many activities supporting the development of climate policies. However, the 
functionality of the Interactive Atlas is primarily aimed at supporting the knowledge assessment. 
 
Much of the assessment in this report is based on multiple lines of evidence (Cross Chapter Box 10.3). The 
Interactive Atlas facilitates combining multiple observational and model-generated datasets and spatial and 
temporal analyses that combine to support statements on the characteristics of the climate system. The use of 
predefined spatial and temporal aggregations imposes constraints on the ability to make specific or tailored 
assessments but does provide essential background and uncertainty information to generate broad findings 
and provide confidence statements on these. Also, the inclusion of a selection of extremes and CIDs is a new 
element in the Interactive Atlas and facilitates broader application including the handshake with WGII. 
Below, some guidelines on the use, interpretation and limitations of the Interactive Atlas are given. 
 
 
### Atlas.2.4.2  Guidelines for the Interactive Atlas 
 
#### Atlas.2.4.2.1  Quantitative support for assessments 
Many assessment statements make use of evidence derived from observed changes, model projections, and 
process-oriented attribution of changes to human interventions. The Interactive Atlas shows a small subset of 
available observations that document climate change, namely surface air temperature and total precipitation 
(and thus not including observations of other atmospheric and Earth system components used as part of the 
evidence base for the report). Only datasets that have (near) global or large regional gridded spatial coverage 
and go back multiple decades are used. For each variable multiple datasets are included, but some of these 
have overlapping native ground-station observations and so are not independent (see Section Atlas.1.4.1). 
The datasets show patterns of substantial spatial and temporal variability, and the empirical evidence of a 
non-stationary climatology needs to be filtered from this information. Issues with quality, representativity, 
and mutual consistency lead to constraints on their use for attribution of causes of trends (see Section 
10.4.1.2 for examples). The practice of attributing trends and extreme events to human causes gives 
confidence that these trends are expected to continue in the (near) future, provided the human drivers of 
climate change remain unchanged. However, large internal variability at decadal time scales can be mis-
interpreted as an anthropogenic influence on the likelihood of extreme events, and in that case extrapolation 
of trends cannot be expected to be a reliable predictor for the future (Schiermeier, 2018). 
 
The Interactive Atlas gives access to a specific set of climate variables from a large number of climate model 
simulations, particularly the (global) CMIP5, CMIP6 and (regional) CORDEX archives. The global model 
outputs generally give a relatively coarse picture of climate change, which is an important line of evidence 
for the detection and attribution of climate change, but is rarely directly applicable for local climate change 
assessment or support of policy design (van den Hurk et al., 2018). To provide additional detail, downscaling 
global projections with regional climate models (RCMs) or statistical downscaling can be undertaken but 
also adds a source of uncertainty as it involves additional modelling (see Section 10.3).  
 
The information displayed in the Interactive Atlas allows a number of sources of uncertainty to be 
quantified. ‘Observational uncertainty’ is represented by the use of multiple (albeit often not completely 
independent) observational datasets. ‘Uncertainty due to internal variability’ cannot be quantified directly 
since multiple realizations from historic and future projections are not accessible (the Interactive Atlas uses a 
single realization of each model). The use of a large collection of model systems allows for an elaborate 
quantification of ‘model uncertainty’. In addition, a comparison of CMIP5 and CMIP6 supports evidence of 
progress in model quality since the AR5, while the evaluation of the added value of RCMs reveals model 
uncertainty related to spatial resolution (see Section 10.3). Finally, the assessment of ‘scenario uncertainty’ 
is supported by the inclusion of multiple emission scenarios for both CMIP5, CORDEX and CMIP6.  
 
The communication of uncertainty has a profound influence on the perception of information that is 
exchanged during the communication process. An assessment of uncertainty communication and the barriers 
to climate information construction is given in Section 10.5.4.  
 
 
#### Atlas.2.4.2.2 Insights from physical understanding

The detailed technical findings in IPCC reports also serve as an important benchmark resource for the 
research community. The Interactive Atlas complements the IPCC assessment report as a repository of 
scientific information on global and regional climate and its representation in coordinated model ensemble 
experiments. Regional climate is governed by a mixture of drivers, such as circulation patterns, seasonal 
monsoons, annual cycles of snow and regional land-atmosphere feedbacks. Global warming may affect 
regional climate characteristics by altering the dynamics of their drivers. The Interactive Atlas allows the 
comparison of different levels of global warming on specific regional climate features but is not designed for 
advanced analysis of the relationship between drivers and regional climate characteristics. For this, tailored 
analysis protocols need to be applied, such as the aggregation of climate change information from ensembles 
of regional climate projections, and stratification according to drivers of regional climate such as patterns of 
atmospheric circulation (Lenderink et al., 2014). The analysis of complex regional climate characteristics 
resulting from compound drivers also require additional expert knowledge and data processing (Thompson et 
al., 2016). Section 12.6.2 assesses various categories of climate services, including tailored analysis of 
regional climate processes. 
 
 
#### Atlas.2.4.2.3  Construction of storylines 
Communicating the full extent of available information on future climate for a region, including a 
quantification of uncertainties, can act as a barrier to the uptake and use of such information (Lemos et al., 
2012; Daron et al., 2018). To address the need to simplify and increase the relevance of information for 
specific contexts, recent studies have adopted narrative and storyline approaches (Hazeleger et al., 2015; 
Shepherd et al., 2018) (see Sections 1.4.4 and 10.5.3 for definitions and further discussion on these 
concepts). The use of region-specific climate storylines, including a role for local mechanisms, drivers and 
societal impacts generally requires detailed information that is typically not provided by the Interactive 
Atlas. However, background information and basic (scenario) assumptions can be derived from the 
Interactive Atlas which can be considered to provide an expert knowledge base from which to build targeted 
storylines and climate information. 
 
 
#### Atlas.2.4.2.4  Visual information 
The visual communication of climate information can take many forms. Besides the standard visual products 
typically used for communicating global and regional climate information to practitioners (e.g., maps, time 
series or scatter plots), the Interactive Atlas incorporates new visuals, for example ‘stripes’ (RMetS, 2019), 
facilitating the communication of key messages (e.g., warming and consistency across models) to a less 
technical audience. The various tabular and graphical representation alternatives included as options in the 
Interactive Atlas (Figure Atlas.8) facilitate exploring the information interactively from different 
perspectives and for different levels of detail, thus favouring the communication with the larger and diverse 
audience of IPCC products. 
 
To support the use of visuals provided in the Interactive Atlas for application to different audiences, new 
insights since the AR5 have emerged from a range of scientific disciplines, including the cognitive and 
psychological sciences (Harold et al., 2016). Studies have used interviews and online surveys to assess 
interpretations of visuals used to communicate climate information and uncertainties (Daron et al., 2015; 
Lorenz et al., 2015; McMahon et al., 2015; Retchless and Brewer, 2016). They commonly find wide-ranging 
interpretations and varied understandings of climate information amongst respondents due to the choice of 
visuals. In addition, Taylor et al. (2015) found that preferences for a particular visualization approach do not 
always align with approaches that achieve greatest accuracy in interpretation. Choosing appropriate visuals 
for a particular purpose and audience can be informed by testing and evaluation with target groups. 
 
 
#### Atlas.2.4.2.5  Dedicated climate change assessment programs 
Communication aimed at informing the general public about assessed scientific findings on climate change 
have a different purpose and format than if intended to inform a specific target audience to support 
adaptation or mitigation policies (Whetton et al., 2016). The growing societal engagement with climate 
change means IPCC reports are increasingly used directly by businesses, the financial sector, health 
practitioners, civil society, the media, and educators at all levels. The IPCC reports could effectively be 
considered a tiered set of products with information relevant to a range of audiences. 
 
The Interactive Atlas does provide access to a collection of observational and modelling datasets, presented 
in a form that supports the distillation of information on observed and projected climate trends at the regional 
scale. Access to the repository of underlying datasets enables further processing for particular purposes. As 
noted above, it is not the intention nor the ambition of this IPCC assessment and the Interactive Atlas 
component to provide a climate service for supporting targeted policies. For this an increasing number of 
dedicated climate change assessment programs have been carried out, aiming at mapping climate change 
information relevant for adaptation and mitigation decision support.  
 
For instance, the European Environment Agency (2018) provides an overview of European national climate 
change scenario programs. Most of these use CMIP5 (or earlier) global climate change ensembles driven by 
an agreed set of greenhouse-gas emission scenarios, followed by downscaling using RCMs and/or statistical 
methods, in order to generate regionally representative hydrometeorological indicators of climate change. In 
some cases, output of selected downscaled global and regional models is provided to users (Whetton et al., 
2012; Daron et al., 2018). Uptake by users is strongly dependent on providing justification of the selection or 
for the downscaling procedure and if further steps are needed to tailor the information to local scales (Lemos 
et al., 2012). More comprehensive programs provide probabilistic climate information by careful analysis 
and interpretation of ensembles of model outputs (Lowe et al., 2018). The information is generally tailored to 
professional practitioners with expertise to interpret and process this probabilistic data. This top-down 
probabilistic information chain is not always able to highlight the essential climate change information for 
users, and alternative bottom-up approaches are encouraged (Frigg et al., 2013). Section 12.6.2 assesses 
climate services including the national climate assessments and user uptake. 
 
 
# Atlas.3  Global synthesis 
 
Most other chapters in WGI assess past or future behaviour of specific aspects of the global climate system 
and this section introduces some of the key results, specifically from Chapters 2, 4 and 9. This provides a 
global overview on observations and information from the CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensembles to underpin the 
regional assessments in the rest of the Atlas Chapter and the results displayed in the Interactive Atlas. Thus, 
its aim is not to generate an assessment of regional climate change directly but to provide the global context 
for this information derived later in the Atlas. Section Atlas.3.1 considers global atmospheric and land-
surface information with global ocean information in Section Atlas.3.2.  

## Atlas.3.1 Global atmosphere and land surface 
 
The principal atmospheric quantities of interest for understanding how climate change may impact human 
and ecological systems, as well as being key global indicators of change, are surface air temperature and 
precipitation. They are therefore a significant focus of the regional climate assessments in the following 
regional sections of the chapter (Atlas.4 to Atlas.11) and of the Interactive Atlas. Changes in these variables 
over land during the recent past (1960–2015) are shown in Figure Atlas.11 using results from two global 
datasets (assessed in Chapter 2) to illustrate both where there is robust information on observed trends and 
observational uncertainty.  
 
For temperature, a clear signal of warming is seen over most land areas with an amplification at high 
latitudes, though all continents apart from Europe also have regions where trends are not significant. 
Significant changes in annual mean precipitation are seen over much more limited areas though with 
consistent increasing trends over some northern high-latitude regions and decreasing trends over smaller 
regions in tropical Africa, the Americas and Southwest Asia. The information conveyed in Figure Atlas.11 
on both consensus in the signal of change and on observational uncertainty is used in this chapter as a line of 
evidence to assess historical observed trends.  
 
As an alternative way of viewing and summarising information in the observational data, the panels (c) and 
(d) in Figure Atlas.11 show the time at which any significant temperature trends from the Berkeley Earth and 
CRUTEM5 datasets, averaged over the reference regions, emerged from interannual variability – with a 
signal to noise ratio greater than two (Hawkins et al., 2020). In the former a regionally averaged warming 
signal has emerged over all of the land reference regions. In the latter, emergence times are only calculated 
for those regions which have data available in more than 50% of the land area (unlike Berkeley Earth, 
CRUTEM does not include spatial interpolation, see Section 2.3.1.1.3) and these are similar for all but one of 
the regions indicating that observational uncertainty does not change the main conclusion of widespread 
emergence of surface temperature signals over land regions.  
 
<figref>ATLAS.11</figref> 

As described earlier, information on projected future changes is required both at different time periods in the 
future under a range of emissions scenarios but also for different global warming levels. Figure Atlas.12 
shows the global surface air temperature change projection calculated from the CMIP6 ensemble mean of for 
the middle of the century under the SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0 emissions scenarios compared to the end of the 
century warming under SSP3-7.0 and for a global warming level of 2°C. The patterns of changes are similar 
to the observed warming and there is a high level of consistency with CMIP5 in terms of both patterns and 
magnitude of change (Interactive Atlas). However, for the long-term future, warming in the CMIP6 
ensemble is generally higher, reflecting the increase in the top end of the range of climate sensitivities 
amongst the CMIP6 GCMs (Figure Atlas.13).  

<figref>ATLAS.12</figref> 
 
Figure Atlas.12 demonstrates how temperature is projected to increase for all regions, and at a greater rate 
than the global average over many land regions and with significant amplification in the Arctic. It also shows 
the higher mid-century warming and significantly higher end of century warming under the high-emission 
SSP3-7.0 scenario compared to the low-emission SSP1-2.6 scenario. Conversely, comparing the projected 
2°C Global Warming Level change with that projected additional warming compared to the recent past under 
the SSP1-2.6 scenario demonstrates the much smaller additional warming projected under this low-emission 
scenario. Finally, the maps display the CMIP6 ensemble mean projection but it is important to explore the 
full range of outcomes from the ensemble, for example when undertaking a comprehensive risk assessment 
in which temperature is an important hazard. This can be explored regionally in the Interactive Atlas 
(Section Atlas.2) by viewing the timeseries of changes for all of the models within the ensemble over the 
AR6 WGI reference regions (Figure Atlas.2:).  
 
Changes in annual mean precipitation present a more complex picture with regions of decrease as well as 
increase and areas where there is model disagreement on the sign of the change, even when the signal is 
strong in the long-term future period as shown in Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1, Figure 1. However, as with the 
temperature changes, there is a high level of consistency in the patterns and magnitude of the precipitation 
changes, with changes in some areas being larger in the long-term future period. Considering changes over 
land, Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1, Figure 1 also shows that at lower warming levels there are many regions, 
especially in the southern hemisphere, where there is no robust signal of change from the models.  
 
In addition to displaying results from global model ensembles as maps of projected changes and their 
robustness or as timeseries of the projected temporal evolution of the median and range of a climate statistic, 
it is often useful to generate area-averaged summaries of these statistics under different future emission 
scenarios or at specific global warming levels. This is demonstrated in Figure Atlas.13 and forms the basis of 
a common set of analyses which are presented for the reference regions in the regional assessments in the 
following Sections Atlas.4 to Atlas.11. It shows the range of projected changes compared to the 1850–1900 
and the recent past 1995–2014 baseline periods for the CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensembles. The first four panels 
show: annual mean changes in temperature globally and over land only for various global warming levels 
and emission scenarios and time periods (left pair) and then again globally and for global land, changes in 
precipitation and temperature at the same global warming levels (right pair). The second four panels provide 
the same temperature and precipitation information globally and for global land only in the December–
February and July–August seasons. These results demonstrate the consensus between the two ensembles for 
increased warming over land areas and increases in global precipitation at all warming levels and that global 
land precipitation increases more. They also show the increased precipitation response in DJF reflecting the 
large precipitation increases in the northern hemisphere higher latitudes in winter. Finally, they demonstrate 
the greater warming projected by the CMIP6 ensemble, as an average over the ensemble and the upper end 
of the range. See Chapter 4 for an in-depth assessment of these results. 

<figref>ATLAS.13</figref> 
 
Global warming leads to systematic changes in regional climate variability via various mechanisms such as 
thermodynamic responses via altered lapse rates (Kröner et al., 2017; Brogli et al., 2019) and land-
atmosphere feedbacks (Boé and Terray, 2014). These can modify temporal and spatial variability of 
temperature and precipitation, including an altered seasonal and diurnal cycle and return frequency of 
extremes. Regional influences from and feedbacks with sea surface, clouds, radiation and other processes 
also modulate the regional response to enhanced warming, both locally and, via teleconnections, remotely.  
 
Given their potential to influence extremes in temperature, precipitation and other climatic impact-drivers 
and hazards, and thus risks to human and ecological systems, it is important to understand these links for 
developing adaptations in response to clear anthropogenic influences on individual hazards. This will also 
support the related fields of disaster risk reduction and global sustainable development efforts (Steptoe et al., 
2018). They demonstrated that 15 regional hazards shared connections via the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, 
with the Indian Ocean Dipole, North Atlantic Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode (see Annex IV) 
being secondary sources of significant regional interconnectivity (Figure Atlas.14). Understanding these 
connections and quantifying the concurrence of resulting hazards can support adaptation planning as well as 
multi-hazard resilience and disaster risk reduction goals. 
 
 
<figref>ATLAS.14</figref> 
 
The main modes of variability influencing global and regional climate are comprehensively described in 
Annex IV. In the context of the assessment in the Atlas chapter, they are important because of their influence 
on the variability of temperature (Part A) and precipitation (Part B) in regions around the world. This is 
quantified in Table Atlas.1: which lists the fraction of interannual variance in seasonal mean temperature and 
precipitation explained by variability in these modes. The table provides information on the influence of the 
teleconnections for selected seasons for the interannual to decadal modes and at an annual scale for the 
multi-decadal. The columns related to the interannual to decadal modes focus on the seasons where these 
connections are strongest but each mode of variability will often have influences in other seasons (for more 
details see Annex IV). The table shows that for many regions, seasonal temperature and precipitation is 
substantially modulated by these modes of variability, all regions feel some influence and variability in 
ocean basins often has influence in multiple remote regions. 
 
<tableref>ATLAS.1</tableref> 
 
## Atlas.3.2 Global Ocean
 
As with the atmosphere, there are several key ocean-related quantities which are relevant for understanding 
how climate change may impact human and ecological systems and/or key global indicators of change. 
These include ocean surface temperature and heat content, sea-surface height, sea ice cover and thickness, 
and certain chemical properties such as ocean acidity and oxygen concentration. For example, there is 
growing awareness of the threat presented by ocean acidification to ecosystem services and its socio-
economic consequences are becoming increasingly apparent and quantifiable (Hurd et al., 2018) and SR1.5 
(IPCC, 2018c) noted a significant impact of low levels of global warming on the state of the global oceanic 
ecosystems and food security. For instance, 70–90% of coral reefs are projected to decline at a warming 
level of 1.5°C, with larger losses at 2°C. 
 
Thus, because of their importance to coastal populations and infrastructure and ocean ecosystems, the 
Interactive Atlas focuses on change in sea-surface temperature, sea level and pH. Figure Atlas.15:shows 
projected changes sea-surface temperature and sea level at the end of the century under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-
8.5 emissions, demonstrating the much larger changes seen with the higher-emission scenario. The projected 
changes in sea level show the significantly greater increases, of up to 1 m locally, under a high-emissions 
future. Regional details of these projected changes under a range of emission scenarios and time periods can 
be explored in the Interactive Atlas. An in-depth assessment of these changes is presented in Section 5.3 and 
Chapter 9. 
 
<figref>ATLAS.15</figref> 
 
# Atlas.4  Africa 
 
The assessment in this section focuses on changes in average temperature and precipitation (rainfall and 
snow), including the most recent years of observations, updates to observed datasets, the consideration of 
recent studies using CMIP5 and those using CMIP6 and CORDEX simulations. Assessment of changes in 
extremes are in Chapter 11 (Table 11.4–11.6) and climatic impact-drivers in Chapter 12 (Table 12.1-12.12). 
 
 
## Atlas.4.1  Key features of the regional climate and findings from previous IPCC assessments 
 
### Atlas.4.1.1  Key features of the regional climate 
 
Africa has many varied climates which can be categorized as dry regime in the Saharan region, tropical 
humid regime in West and East Africa except for parts of the Greater Horn of Africa (alpine) and the Sahel 
(semi‐arid), and a dry/wet season regime in the northern and southern African region including the Namibian 
desert; each climate region has its local variations resulting in very high spatial and temporal variations (Peel 
et al., 2007). Based on the varied climates, nine subregions are defined for Africa (see Figure Atlas.16:) the 
Mediterranean region (MED) including North Africa, Sahara including parts of the Sahel (SAH), West 
Africa (WAF), Central Africa (CAF), North Eastern Africa (NEAF), South Eastern Africa (SEAF), West 
Southern Africa (WSAF), East Southern Africa (ESAF) and Madagascar (MDG). 
 
The climatic features that characterize the intra-seasonal and inter-annual variability of Africa are mainly the 
Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) which is confined to the deep tropics during boreal winter, Pacific Decadal 
Variability (PDV), and the shift of the Atlantic Inter Tropical Convergence Zone in response to changes in 
the meridional SST gradient. A positive phase of the PDV weakens African monsoons (Meehl and Hu, 
2006)(Figure AIV.8d) and MJO phase 4 suppresses convection over the equatorial Africa (Figure AIV.10a) 
(see Annex IV). Other features influence specific subregions. For instance, El Niño events increase 
precipitation in eastern Africa and decreases precipitation in southern Africa. Over southern Africa there is a 
strong link between ENSO and droughts (Meque and Abiodun, 2015). The positive phase of the IOD 
increases rainfall in eastern tropical Africa in boreal autumn to early winter (Figure AIV.5d), while the 
negative phase induces the reduction in rainfall. West African monsoon is influenced by Atlantic Zonal 
Mode (AZM) with decreased rainfall over the Sahel and increased rainfall over Guinea (Losada et al., 2010). 
Positive Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV) influences positive anomalies all year round over a broad 
Mediterranean region, including North Africa. 
 
 
### Atlas.4.1.2  Findings from previous IPCC assessments 
 
The most recent IPCC reports, AR5 and SR1.5 (Christensen et al., 2013; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018), state 
that over most parts of Africa, minimum temperatures have warmed more rapidly than maximum 
temperatures during the last 50 to 100 years (medium confidence). In the same period minimum and 
maximum temperatures have increased by more than 0.5°C relative to 1850-1900 (high confidence). While 
the quality of ground observational temperature measurements tends to be high compared to that of 
measurements for other climate variables, Africa remains an under-represented region as reported in SR1.5 
(Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; IPCC, 2018c). Based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 
(CMIP5) ensemble and reported in IPCC AR5 and SR1.5, surface air temperatures in Africa are projected to 
rise faster than the global average increase and likely to increase by more than 2°C and up to 6°C by the end 
of the century relative to the late 20th century if global warming reaches 2°C (Bindoff et al., 2013; Niang et 
al., 2014; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). The higher temperature magnitudes are projected during boreal 
summer. Southern Africa is likely to exceed the global mean land surface temperature increase in all seasons 
by the end of the century. Temperature projections for East Africa indicate considerable warming under 
RCP8.5 where average warming across all models is approximately 4°C by the end of the century. 
According to SROCC, eastern Africa like other regions with smaller glaciers is projected to lose more than 
80% of its glaciers by 2100 under RCP8.5 (medium confidence) (Hock et al., 2019b).  
 
West Africa has also experienced an overall reduction of rainfall over the 20th century, with a recovery 
towards the last 20 years of the century (Christensen et al., 2013). Over the last three decades rainfall has 
decreased over East Africa especially between March and May/June. Projected rainfall changes over Africa 
in the mid and late 21st century is uncertain. In regions of high or complex topography such as the Ethiopian 
Highlands, downscaled projections indicate likely increases in rainfall and extreme rainfall by the end of the 
21st century. However, Northern Africa and the south-western parts of South Africa are likely to have a 
reduction in precipitation.  
 
The consequence of increased temperature and evapotranspiration, and decreased precipitation amount, in 
interaction with climate variability and human activities, have contributed to desertification in dryland areas 
in Sub-Saharan Africa (medium confidence) as reported in SRCCL (Mirzabaev et al., 2019). 
 
 
## Atlas.4.2  Assessment and synthesis of observations, trends and attribution 
 
Figure Atlas.11: shows observed trends in annual mean surface temperature and indicates it has been rising 
rapidly over Africa over 1960–2015 and with significant increases in all regions of 0.1°C–0.2°C per decade 
and higher over some northern, eastern and south-western regions (high confidence) (see also Interactive 
Atlas). This is confirmed by an independent analysis performed for a longer period (1961–2018) over areas 
where long-term homogeneous temperature time-series are available (Engelbrecht et al., 2015). More 
specifically over the Horn of East Africa, the long-term mean annual temperature change between 1930 and 
2014 showed two distinct but contrary trends: significant decreases between 1930 and 1969 and increases 
from 1970 to 2014 (Ghebrezgabher et al., 2016). North Africa has an overall warming in observed seasonal 
temperature (Barkhordarian et al., 2012; Lelieveld et al., 2016) with positive trends in annual minimum and 
maximum temperatures (Vizy and Cook, 2012). Temperatures over West Africa have increased over the last 
50 years ⁠(Mouhamed et al., 2013; Niang et al., 2014) with a spatially variable warming reaching 0.5°C per 
decade from 1983 to 2010 (Sylla et al., 2016). West Africa has also experienced a decrease in the number of 
cool nights as well as more frequent warm days and warm spells (Mouhamed et al., 2013; Ringard et al., 
2016). Similarly, East Africa has experienced a significant increase in temperature since the beginning of the 
early 1980s (Anyah and Qiu, 2012) with an increase in seasonal mean temperature. Over South Africa, 
positive trends were found in the annual mean, maximum and minimum temperatures for 1960–2003 in all 
seasons, except for the central interior (Kruger and Shongwe, 2004; Zhou et al., 2010; Collins, 2011; Kruger 
and Sekele, 2013; MacKellar et al., 2014), where minimum temperatures have decreased significantly 
(MacKellar et al., 2014). Inland southern Africa, minimum temperatures have increased more rapidly than 
maximum temperatures (New et al., 2006).  
 
Most areas lack enough observational data to draw conclusions about trends in annual precipitation over the 
past century. In addition, many regions of Africa have discrepancies between different observed precipitation 
datasets (Sylla et al., 2013; Panitz et al., 2014). A statistically significant (95% confidence level) decrease in 
rainfall and the number of rainy days is reported in autumn over the east, central and north-eastern parts of 
South Africa in spring and summer during 1960–2010 (MacKellar et al., 2014; Kruger and Nxumalo, 2017). 
Central Africa has experienced a significant decrease in total precipitation which is likely associated with a 
significant decrease of the length of the maximum number of consecutive wet days (Aguilar et al., 2009). 
Furthermore, rainfall decreased significantly in the Horn of Africa (Tierney et al., 2015) with the largest 
reductions during the long rains season March to May (Lyon and Dewitt, 2012; Viste et al., 2013; Rowell et 
al., 2015). Over mountainous areas significant increases are found in the number of rain days around the 
southern Drakensberg in spring and summer during the period 1960–2010 (MacKellar et al., 2014). 
Similarly, southern West Africa is observed to have had more intense rainfall from 1950 to 2014 during the 
second rainy season of September to November (Nkrumah et al., 2019). The Sahel region also had more 
intense rainfall throughout the rainy season (Panthou et al., 2014, 2018b, 2018a; Sanogo et al., 2015; Gaetani 
et al., 2017; Taylor et al., 2017; Biasutti, 2019) during the period 1980–2010. Southern African rainfall 
shows a significant downtrend of –0.013 mm day–1 year–1 in recent decades and –0.003 mm day–1 year–1 for 
longer periods during 1900–2010 (Jury, 2013) (low confidence). 
 
Temperature increases over Africa in the 20th century can be attributed to the strong evidence of a continent-
wide anthropogenic signal in the warming (Hoerling et al., 2006; Min and Hense, 2007; Stott et al., 2010, 
2011; Niang et al., 2014)(Figure 3.8). More specifically over West Africa, the clear emergence of 
temperature change (Figure Atlas.11:) is due to the relatively small natural climate variability in the region 
which generates narrow climate bounds that can be easily surpassed by relatively small climate changes 
(Niang et al., 2014). Warming over North Africa is largely due to anthropogenic climate forcing (Knippertz 
et al., 2003; Barkhordarian et al., 2012; Diffenbaugh et al., 2017).  
 
The drying observed over the Sahel in the 1960s to 1970s has been attributed to warming of the South 
Atlantic SST and southern African drying as a response to Indian Ocean warming⁠ (Hoerling et al., 2006; Dai, 
2011). Enhanced rainfall intensity since the mid-1980s over the Sahel (Maidment et al., 2015; Sanogo et al., 
2015) is associated with increased greenhouse gases suggesting an anthropogenic influence (Biasutti, 2019) 
(medium confidence). In the last decade, the changes in the timing of onset and cessation of rainfall over 
Africa have been linked to changes in the progression of the tropical rainband and the Saharan Heat Low 
(Dunning et al., 2018; Wainwright et al., 2019). Moreover, later onset and earlier cessation of Eastern Africa 
rainfall is associated with a delayed and then faster movement of the tropical rainband northwards during the 
boreal spring and northward shift of the Saharan Heat Low (Wainwright et al., 2019) driven by 
anthropogenic carbon emissions and changing aerosol forcings (medium confidence). Over East Africa, the 
drying trend is associated with an anthropogenic-forced relatively rapid warming of Indian Ocean SSTs 
(Williams and Funk, 2011; Hoell et al., 2017); a shift to warmer SSTs over the western tropical Pacific and 
cooler SSTs over the central and eastern tropical Pacific (Lyon and Dewitt, 2012); multidecadal variability of 
SSTs in the tropical Pacific, with cooling in the east and warming in the west (Lyon, 2014); and the 
strengthening of the 200-mb easterlies (Liebmann et al., 2017). However, decadal natural variability from 
SST variations over the Pacific Ocean has also been associated with the drying trend of the East Africa 
(Wang et al., 2014; Hoell et al., 2017) with an anthropogenic-forced rapid warming of Indian Ocean SSTs 
(medium confidence).  
 
## Atlas.4.3  Assessment of model performance 
 
Model development has advanced in the world, but Africa still lags as a focus and in its contribution (James 
et al., 2018). None of the current generation of general circulation models (GCMs) was developed in Africa 
(Watterson et al., 2014), and the relevant processes in the continent have not been the priority for model 
development but treated in a one-size-fit-all approach (James et al., 2018) except for a few studies that 
focused on convective-permitting climate projections (Stratton et al., 2018; Kendon et al., 2019). However, 
there are growing efforts to boost African climate science by running and evaluating climate models over 
Africa (Endris et al., 2013; Kalognomou et al., 2013; Gbobaniyi et al., 2014; Engelbrecht et al., 2015; Klutse 
et al., 2016; Gibba et al., 2019).  
 
The CMIP project previously did not result in improved performance for Africa (Flato et al., 2013; Rowell, 
2013; Whittleston et al., 2017) and culling ensembles based on existing metrics for Africa fails to reduce the 
range of uncertainty in precipitation projections (Roehrig et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2015; Rowell et al., 2016) 
but biases over Africa are lower in CMIP6 compared to CMIP5 (Almazroui et al., 2020b). Nonetheless, the 
CMIP5 ensemble has been evaluated over Africa to advance its application for climate research (Biasutti, 
2013; Rowell, 2013; Dike et al., 2015; McSweeney and Jones, 2016; Onyutha et al., 2016; Wainwright et al., 
2019) as has, more recently, the CMIP6 ensemble (Almazroui et al., 2020b). 
 
Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) regional climate models have been widely 
evaluated over Africa. They capture the occurrence of the West African Monsoon jump and the timing and 
amplitude of mean annual cycle of precipitation and temperature over the homogeneous subregions of West 
Africa (Gbobaniyi et al., 2014), simulate eastern Africa rainfall adequately (Endris et al., 2013) and over 
Southern Africa capture the observed climatological spatial patterns of extreme precipitation (Pinto et al., 
2016). They simulate also the phasing and amplitude of monthly rainfall evolution and the spatial 
progression of the wet season onset well over Southern Africa (Shongwe et al., 2015). However, 
discrepancies and biases in present-day rainfall are reported over Uganda from the RCM-simulated rainfall 
compared to three gridded observational datasets (Kisembe et al., 2018). Specifically, they reported that the 
CORDEX models underestimate annual rainfall of Uganda and struggle to reproduce the variability of the 
long and short rainy seasons.  
 
 
## Atlas.4.4  Assessment and synthesis of projections 
 
Research over Africa has improved since AR5 and though SR1.5 (de Coninck et al., 2018) has synthesised 
new information for the continent, there is still not enough literature on specific areas for assessment. CMIP5 
and CMIP6 projections (Figure Atlas.16:) are for continued warming, with median projected regional 
warming for 2080–2100 compared to 1995–2014 of between 1°C and 2°C under SSP1-2.6/RCP2.6 
emissions and exceeding 4°C and in some regions 5°C under SSP5-8.5/RCP8.5 emissions. The central 
interior of Southern and Northern Africa are likely to warm faster than equatorial and tropical regions 
(Interactive Atlas). Projections from CMIP5 show that East Africa is likely to warm by 1.7°C–2.8 °C and 
2.2°C–5.4°C under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios respectively in the period 2071–2100 relative to 1961–
1990 (Ongoma et al., 2018). Over southern Africa, areas in the south-western region of the subcontinent, 
covering South Africa and parts of Namibia and Botswana, are projected to experience the largest increase in 
temperature, which are expected to be greater than the global mean warming (Maúre et al., 2018). A large 
ensemble of CORDEX Africa simulations have been used to project the impact of 1.5°C and 2°C global 
warming levels (GWLs) (Klutse et al., 2018; Lennard et al., 2018; Maúre et al., 2018; Mba et al., 2018; 
Nikulin et al., 2018; Osima et al., 2018). While a few studies addressed the whole African continent 
(Lennard et al., 2018; Nikulin et al., 2018), some focused on specific regions of Africa (Diedhiou et al., 
2018; Klutse et al., 2018; Kumi and Abiodun, 2018; Maúre et al., 2018; Mba et al., 2018). CORDEX 
simulations project robust warming over Africa in excess of the global mean (Lennard et al., 2018; Nikulin 
et al., 2018) and over West Africa the magnitude of regional warming reaches the 2080–2100 global 
warming level one to two decades earlier (Mora et al., 2013; Niang et al., 2014; Sylla et al., 2016; Klutse et 
al., 2018). Temperature increases projected under RCP8.5 over Sudan and northern Ethiopia implying that 
the Greater Horn of Africa would warm faster than the global mean relative to 1971–2000 (Osima et al., 
2018). Over North Africa, summer mean temperatures from CORDEX, CMIP5 (RCP8.5) and CMIP6 
(SSP5-8.5) are projected to increase beyond 6.0°C by the end of the century with respect to the period 1970–
2000 (Schilling et al., 2012; Ozturk et al., 2018; Almazroui et al., 2020b), see also the Interactive Atlas. Note 
that results for the CORDEX-AFR over the Mediterranean (MED) are consistent with those reported from 
the CORDEX-EUR dataset (Figure Atlas.24:; Section Atlas.1.3), in agreement with Legasa et al. (2020). 
 
<figref>ATLAS.16</figref> 
 
Projected rainfall changes over Africa in the mid and late 21st century are uncertain in many regions, highly 
variable spatially and with differing levels of model agreements (Figure Atlas.16:) though with robust 
projections of decreases in MED and WSAF and increases in NEAF and SEAF by 2080–2100 under high 
emissions (Interactive Atlas). Some uncertainties are reported over parts of Africa from CORDEX 
projections (Dosio and Panitz, 2016; Endris et al., 2016; Klutse et al., 2018). For example, large uncertainties 
are associated with projections at 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming over Central Africa (Mba et al., 2018) 
and over the Sahel (Gbobaniyi et al., 2014; Sylla et al., 2016). Over southern Africa, enhanced warming is 
projected to result in a reduction in mean rainfall across the region (Maúre et al., 2018) and in particular over 
the Limpopo Basin and smaller areas of the Zambezi Basin in Zambia, and also parts of Western Cape, 
South Africa, under a global warming of 2°C. The projections of reduced precipitation in summer rainfall 
regions of southern Africa are associated with delayed wet season onset in spring (Dunning et al., 2018) due 
to a northward shift and delayed breakdown of the Congo Air Boundary (Howard and Washington, 2020). 
However, projected rainfall intensity over southern Africa is likely to increase and be magnified under 
RCP8.5 compared with RCP4.5 for the period 2069–2098 relative to the reference period (1976–2005) 
(Pinto et al., 2018). For West Africa, rainfall projection is uncertain because of the contrasting signals from 
models (Dosio et al., 2019). Nonetheless, West Africa river basin-scale irrigation potential would decline 
under 2°C of global warming even for areas where water availability increases (Sylla et al., 2018). The 
western and eastern Sahel are projected as hotspots for delayed rainfall onset dates of about four days and six 
days causing reduced length of rainy season in the 1.5°C to 2°C warmer climates under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 
scenarios (Kumi and Abiodun, 2018). Projected delay in rainfall cessation dates and a longer length of rainy 
season over the western part of the Guinea coast is likely under the same scenarios (Sellami et al., 2016; 
Kumi and Abiodun, 2018)(Figure Atlas.16:). There is a tendency towards an increase in annual mean 
precipitation over central Sahel and eastern Africa (Figure Atlas.16, (Nikulin et al., 2018) especially over the 
Ethiopian highlands with up to 0.5 mm day–1 (Osima et al., 2018). 
 
 
## Atlas.4.5  Summary 
 
The rate of surface temperature increase has generally been more rapid in Africa than the global average and 
by at least 0.1°C–0.2°C during 1960–2015 (high confidence). Minimum temperatures have increased more 
rapidly than maximum temperatures over inland southern Africa (medium confidence). Since 1970, mean 
temperature over East Africa has shown an increasing trend but showed a decreasing trend in the previous 40 
years (medium confidence).  
 
The Horn of Africa has experienced significantly decreased rainfall during the long rain season from March 
to May (high confidence) and drying trends in this and other parts of Africa are attributable to oceanic 
influences (high confidence), resulting from both internal variability and anthropogenic causes. Drying over 
the Sahel in the last century was attributed to an increase in the South Atlantic SST and more recently over 
southern African as a response to anthropogenic-forced Indian Ocean warming. Drying over East Africa is 
associated with decadal natural variability in SSTs over the Pacific Ocean. The enhanced rainfall intensity 
over the Sahel in the last two decades is associated with increased greenhouse gases indicating an 
anthropogenic influence (medium confidence).  
 
Relative to the late 20th century, annual mean temperature over Africa is projected to rise faster than the 
global average (very high confidence) with the increase likely to exceed 4°C by the end of the century under 
RCP8.5 emissions. The central interior of Southern and Northern Africa are likely to warm faster than 
equatorial and tropical regions (high confidence).  

There are contrasting signals in the projections of rainfall over some parts of Africa until the end of the 21st 
century (high confidence) though changes in any given region are generally projected with medium 
confidence. In regions of high or complex topography such as the Ethiopian Highlands, downscaled 
projections indicate increases in rainfall by the end of the 21st century. However, Northern Africa and the 
south-western parts of South Africa are likely to have a reduction in precipitation under higher warming 
levels (high confidence). Over West Africa, rainfall is projected to decrease in the Western Sahel subregion 
(medium confidence) and increase in the central Sahel subregion (low confidence) and along the Guinea 
Coast subregion (medium confidence). Rainfall amounts are projected to reduce over the western part of East 
Africa, but to increase in the eastern part of the region (medium confidence). Southern Africa is projected to 
have a reduction in annual mean rainfall but increases in rainfall intensity by 2100 (medium confidence). 
 
 
# Atlas.5  Asia 
 
The assessment in this section focuses on changes in average temperature and precipitation (rainfall and 
snow), including the most recent years of observations, updates to observed datasets, the consideration of 
recent studies using CMIP5 and those using CMIP6 and CORDEX simulations. Assessment of changes in 
extremes are in Chapter 11 (Table 11.7–11.9) and climatic impact-drivers in Chapter 12 (Table 12.4). It 
covers most Asian territories of the region (Figure Atlas.17:) with the exception of the Russian Arctic, RAR, 
which is assessed as part of the Arctic in section 11.2. These include West and East Siberia (WSB, ESB) and 
the Russian Far East (RFE) in the north; West and East Central Asia (WCA, ECA), the Tibetan Plateau 
(TIB) and East Asia (EAS); and the Arabian Peninsula (ARP), South and Southeast Asia (SAS, SEA) in the 
south. Figure Atlas.17: supports the assessment of regional mean changes in annual mean surface air 
temperature and precipitation over Asia. Due to the high climatological and geographical heterogeneity of 
Asia, the assessment is performed over five sub-continental areas: East Asia (EAS+ECA), North Asia 
(WSB+ESB+RFE), South Asia (SAS+TIB), Southeast Asia (SEA) and Southwest Asia (ARP+WCA).

## Atlas.5.1  East Asia 
 
### Atlas.5.1.1  Key features of the regional climate and findings from previous IPCC assessments  
 
#### Atlas.5.1.1.1  Key features of the regional climate 
The climatic regions defined for East Asia include central and eastern China, Japan and Korea Peninsula 
(regions ECA and EAS in Figure Atlas.17:). East Asia is significantly influenced by monsoon systems (see 
Section 8.3.2.4.2). The seasonal advance or retreat of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) rain band is 
crucial to local climate. The East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) has significant influence on the weather 
and climate over East Asia and plays an important role in regulating winter temperatures including strong 
cold events and snowstorms (Wang and Chen, 2014; Wang and Lu, 2016). The East Asian monsoons exhibit 
considerable variability on a wide range of time scales, including notable interannual variabilities that 
includes an effect of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (Wang et al., 2000) and the Indian Ocean 
Dipole (IOD) (Takaya et al., 2020), and significant inter-decadal variabilities in the 20th century resulted 
from the effect of Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV) (Zhou et al., 2009), see also Annex IV and Table 
Atlas.1:. The thermal conditions of both the Tibetan Plateau and related ocean regions play key roles in 
modulating the intensity of the monsoon circulation. The East Asian monsoons are mainly driven by land-sea 
thermal contrast and, thus, are deeply affected by global climate change (Ding et al., 2014; Gong et al., 
2018).  
 
 
#### Atlas.5.1.1.2  Findings from previous IPCC assessments 
The findings of the IPCC AR5 (Christensen et al., 2013) stated that the EASM and EAWM circulations have 
experienced an inter-decadal scale weakening since the 1970s, leading to a warmer climate in winter and 
enhanced mean precipitation along the Yangtze River Valley (30°N) but deficient mean precipitation in 
North China in summer. Since the middle of the 20th century, it is likely that there has been an increasing 
trend in winter temperatures across much of Asia (Christensen et al., 2013). The numbers of cold days and 
nights have decreased and the numbers of warm days and nights have increased over Asia (Hartmann et al., 
2013). It is likely that there are decreasing numbers of snowfall events where increased winter temperatures 
have been observed (Hartmann et al., 2013). The SRCCL reports a land-use change induced cooling as large 
as –1.5°C in eastern China between 1871 and 2007 (Hartmann et al., 2013). The summer rainfall amount 
over East Asia shows no clear trend during the 20th century.  
 
The IPCC AR5 (Christensen et al., 2013) reports a significant increase in mean temperatures in southeastern 
China, associated with a decrease in the number of frost days under the SRES A2 scenario. The CMIP5 
model projections indicate an increase of temperature in both boreal winter and summer over East Asia for 
RCP4.5. Based on CMIP5 model projections, there is medium confidence in an intensified EASM and 
increased summer precipitation over East Asia. More than 85% of CMIP5 models show an increase in mean 
precipitation of the EASM, while more than 95% of models project an increase in heavy precipitation events 
(Christensen et al., 2013). SROCC states that future projections of annual precipitation indicate increases of 
the order of 5% to 20% over the 21st century in many mountain regions, including the Himalaya and East 
Asia (Hock et al., 2019b). SR1.5 reports that statistically significant changes in heavy precipitation between 
1.5°C and 2°C of global warming are found in East Asia (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). 
 
 
### Atlas.5.1.2  Assessment and synthesis of observations, trends and attribution 
 
Summer (June–August) mean temperature in Eastern China has increased by 0.82°C since reliable 
observations were established in the 1950s (Sun et al., 2014). Based on historical meteorological 
observations, the best estimate of the linear trend of annual mean surface air temperature (SAT) for China 
with 95% uncertainty ranges is 0.38 ± 0.05°C per decade for 1979–2015 (Li et al., 2017). From 1960 to 
2010, the increasing trend of temperature was about 0.34°C per decade in the arid region of northwest China, 
higher than the average over China (Li et al., 2012a; Xu et al., 2015). Over South Korea, warming is 1.4–2.6 
times larger than global trends. The increase is 1.90°C during 1912–2014 and 0.99°C during 1973–2014 
(Park et al., 2017) with a 25–45% urbanization contribution. The annual temperature increased in large cities 
at a rate of 0.29 ± 0.08°C per decade compared with 0.11 ± 0.08°C per decade in other stations in South 
Korea from 1960 to 2010 (Kim et al., 2016a). A relatively high increase in annual mean temperature at the 
rate of 3.0°C per century was detected in the Tokyo metropolitan area for the period 1901–2015 (Matsumoto 
et al., 2017). Trends of annual temperature for the period of 1960–2015 are shown in Figure Atlas.11:. Most 
areas of East Asia have significant warming trends exceeding 0.1°C per decade, and the strongest warming 
(0.3°C–0.4°C per decade) occurs in northern China. 
 
Observational studies indicated significant decadal variations in the EAWM (Wang and Lu, 2016; He et al., 
2017). It weakened significantly around the late 1980s, being relatively strong during 1976–1987 and weaker 
during 1988–2001. The EAWM has recovered in intensity after 2004 and caused frequent and prevalent 
severe cold spells, as well as a number of unusually harsh cold winters in many parts of East Asia during the 
period 2004–2012 (Wang and Chen, 2014; Kug et al., 2015; Ge et al., 2016; Gong et al., 2018). Negative 
zonal mean winter SAT anomalies were observed over the whole of East Asia from 1980 to 1988, with 
positive anomalies observed over high and low latitudes from 1988 to 2010 (Miao and Wang, 2020).  
 
Precipitation trends over East Asia show considerable regional differences (medium confidence). Mean 
precipitation has shown negligible sensitivity to the warming trend with consequently limited overall trends 
in China though summer rainfall daily frequency and intensity show respectively decreasing and increasing 
trends from 1961 to 2014 (Zhou and Wang, 2017). The summer precipitation trends over eastern China 
display a dipole pattern, characterized by positive anomalies in the central-eastern China along the Yangtze 
River Valley and negative anomalies in the north China since the 1950s (Section 8.3.2.4.2). This pattern has 
changed with the enhanced rainfall in the Huaihe River Valley and decreased in the regions south of the 
middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Valley since the 2000s (Liu et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2015). 
The climate in northwest China changed from ‘warm-dry’ to ‘warm-wet’ condition in the mid-1980s (Peng 
and Zhou, 2017; Wang et al., 2020), with an increases rate of annual precipitation of about 3.7% per decade 
from 1961 to 2015 (Wu et al., 2019a) and 11.2 mm per decade between 1960 and 2011 in northern Xinjiang 
(Xu et al., 2015). Mean rainfall and the number of rainy days during the Meiyu-Baiu-Changma period from 
June to September have increased during 1973–2015 in Korea (Lee et al., 2017). The precipitation trend has 
caused a large increase in summer precipitation at a rate of 40.6 ± 4.3 mm per decade, resulting in an 
increase of annual precipitation of 27.7 ± 5.5 mm per decade in South Korea from 1960 to 2010 (Kim et al., 
2016a). Precipitation amounts exhibited a slight decrease at both the annual and seasonal scales in Japan for 
the period 1901–2012 (Duan et al., 2015).  
 
Agriculture intensification through oasis expansion in Xinjiang region has increased summer precipitation in 
the Tianshan mountains (Zhang et al., 2009, 2019b; Deng et al., 2015; Guo and Li, 2015; Yao et al., 2016; 
Xu et al., 2018; Cai et al., 2019) (high confidence from medium evidence with high agreement). However, 
there is very low confidence of the effect of oasis expansion on the temperature warming trend (Han and 
Yang, 2013; Li et al., 2013; Yuan et al., 2017). 
 
In the context of climate warming, intense snowfalls have hit China frequently in recent winters and have 
caused severe damages to the sustainability of the society (Sun et al., 2019). Observations generally show a 
decrease in the frequency and an increase in the mean intensity of snowfalls in north-western, north-eastern 
and south-eastern China and the eastern Tibetan Plateau since the 1960s (Zhou et al., 2018), but the results 
may depend on the objective criteria for identifying wintertime snowfall (Luo et al., 2020a).  
 
 
### Atlas.5.1.3  Assessment of model performance 
 
Current climate models perform poorly in simulating the mean precipitation in East Asia, including the phase 
of the northward progression of the seasonal rain band (Zhang et al., 2018b). Although there has been an 
improvement in the simulation of mean states, interannual variability, and past climate changes in the 
progression from CMIP3 to CMIP5, some previously documented biases (such as the ridge position of the 
western North Pacific Subtropical High and the associated rainfall bias) are still evident in CMIP5 models 
(Sperber et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2017). Most models capture the main characteristics of the winter mean 
circulation over East Asia reasonably well, but they still suffer from difficulty in predicting the interannual 
variability of the EAWM (Shin and Moon, 2018). Models have improved from CMIP5 to CMIP6 for 
climatological temperature and EAWM (Jiang et al., 2020a). Some CMIP6 models also show improvements 
in simulating the annual mean and interannual variation of precipitation (Sellar et al., 2019; Tatebe et al., 
2019; Wu et al., 2019b). The performance of models is sensitive to cumulus convection schemes and 
horizontal resolution (Haarsma et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2017; Kusunoki, 2018b). High-resolution atmospheric 
general circulation models (AGCM) successfully reproduce the intensity and the spatial pattern of the EASM 
rainfall (Li et al., 2015; Yao et al., 2017; Ito et al., 2020a) and improve the simulation of the diurnal cycle of 
precipitation rates and the probability density distributions of daily precipitation over Korea, Japan and 
northern China (Lin et al., 2019), but increasing horizontal resolution (at the typical scales used in GCMs) is 
not always a panacea for solving model biases (Roberts et al., 2018).  
 
Recent studies using CORDEX-EA models with resolution about 12–25 km showed that the RCMs produce 
relatively more detailed regional features of the temperature distribution compared with the driving GCMs 
(Tang et al., 2016). Over China, RCMs provide more spatial details and in general reduce the biases of their 
driving GCMs, in particular in DJF (December–January–February) and over areas with complex topography 
(Wu and Gao, 2020). However, RCMs also show biases in simulating East Asian precipitation and its 
variability (Park et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2016; Zou and Zhou, 2016), and do not always show added value 
compared to the driving GCMs (Li et al., 2018a). For example, by comparing inter-GCM and inter-RCM 
differences around the Japan archipelago, it was found that RCM generate relatively large differences in 
precipitation (Suzuki-Parker et al., 2018). The RCM multi-model ensemble produces superior simulation 
compared to that of a single model (Jin et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2018a). A comparative study of RCMs at 
different spatial resolutions showed with coarse-resolution they present some limitations and high-resolution 
RCMs offer added value for several evaluation metrics (Park et al., 2020). 
 
 
### Atlas.5.1.4  Assessment and synthesis of projections 
 
The development of climate models provides a solid basis for projection of future monsoon changes under 
different global warming scenarios. Coupled model simulations indicate that East Asia will likely experience 
higher warming than the global mean conditions across all global warming levels (Figure Atlas.17:) and with 
the projected warming greater in ECA than EAS. Also, in the CMIP6 ensemble, the multi-model mean and 
90th percentile warming for a given period and emissions scenario are consistently greater than in the 
CMIP5 ensemble. Larger warming magnitudes are projected to occur in the southern, north-western, and 
north-eastern regions of China, parts of Mongolia, the Korean Peninsula, and Japan than in other regions (Li 
et al., 2018b). Projections indicated that the winter SAT increases over the East Asian continent, and the 
precipitation increases over the northern East Asian continent in winter reaching 1.5°C and 2.0°C global 
warming under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios (Miao et al., 2020).  
 
Projected annual precipitation changes in the CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensembles are positive for all warming 
levels in ECA and for the higher warming levels in EAS. Changes in precipitation per degree Celsius global 
warming are larger in DJF than in JJA in ECA but show smaller seasonal difference in EAS (Figure 
Atlas.17). The EASM precipitation is projected to increase but with a complex spatial structure (Kitoh, 2017; 
Moon and Ha, 2017). Simulations from CMIP5 models show that compared with the current summer 
climate, both SAT and precipitation increase significantly over the East Asian continent during the 1.5°C 
warming period (Chen et al., 2019a), and the main mode of EASM precipitation changing from tripolar to 
dipolar (Wang et al., 2018). The increase in precipitable water in the wet EASM region is only slightly 
greater than global average but the increase in precipitation is much greater (Li et al., 2019b). The monsoon 
circulation in the lower troposphere is projected to strengthen due to the enhanced thermal forcing by the 
Tibetan Plateau (He et al., 2019; He and Zhou, 2020), which causes the increased summer precipitation over 
the East Asian continent. Precipitation over eastern China increases for almost all months under global 
warming in projections from GCMs with different horizontal resolutions (Kusunoki, 2018a). Also, under 
RCP scenarios, in the 21st century, mean precipitation is projected to increase (Kim et al., 2020) especially 
in the late afternoons (Oh and Suh, 2018) over the Korean Peninsula due to global warming and associated 
changes in EASM. Increase in JJA mean precipitation is projected in northern East Asia consistently among 
the CMIP models, while northward migration of early summer East Asian rain band such as the Meiyu-Baiu-
Changma is delayed along with that of the mid-latitude westerly jet in the future (Horinouchi et al., 2019). 
However, the geographical distribution of precipitation change tends to depend more on the cumulus 
convection scheme (Ose, 2017) and horizontal resolution of models rather than on SST distributions. Under 
the RCP4.5 and the RCP8.5 scenarios, the interannual variability in EASM rainfall is projected by the multi-
model ensemble mean to increase in the 21st century (Ren et al., 2017). Further studies showed a projected 
increase in heavy rainfall together with increases in rainfall intensity (Endo et al., 2017). Multi-model 
intercomparison indicates significant uncertainties in future projections of climate change in East Asia, 
although precipitation increases consistently across models (Zhou et al., 2017). Simulations under RCP4.5 
scenario project that the number of snow days will be reduced by the end of the 21st century relative to 
1986–2005, primarily owing to the decline of light snowfall events. The total amount is projected to increase 
in north-western China but decrease in the other subregions (Zhou et al., 2018).  
 
The increasing temperature trends under RCP scenarios were consistently reproduced in projections using 
CORDEX-EA models (Kim et al., 2016b) as reported in AR5 using GCMs. However, changes in annual and 
seasonal mean precipitation exhibit significant inter-RCM differences with larger magnitudes and variability 
than in the GCMs (Ham et al., 2016; Ozturk et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2018a; Zhang et al., 2018a). RCM 
simulations project that the Meiyu-Baiu-Changma heavy rainfall will significantly increase in northern Japan 
at the end of the 21st century under the RCP8.5 scenario (Osakada and Nakakita, 2018), but projected 
precipitation amount and number of precipitation days in summer around and over Japan differ as a result of 
RCM uncertainty (Suzuki-Parker et al., 2018). Annual total snowfall is projected to decrease in most parts of 
Japan except for Japan's northern island under RCP2.6 (Kawase et al., 2021).  
 
Statistically downscaling of 37 CMIP5 GCMs for Xinjiang, China projected pronounced temperature 
increase of 0.27℃ to 0.51℃ per decade from 2021 to 2060 while precipitation change was projected to be 
between –1.7% to 6.8% per decade and varying seasonally and spatially (Luo et al., 2018). A decrease of 
precipitation was projected in the western region of Xinjiang during summer. More extreme rainfall events 
were projected to occur during summer and autumn. 
 
 
### Atlas.5.1.5  Summary 
 
In East Asia annual mean temperature has been increasing since the 1950s (high confidence). The linear 
trend of annual mean surface air temperature likely exceeded 0.1°C per decade over most of East Asia from 
1960 to 2015. Trends of annual precipitation show considerable regional differences with areas of both 
increases and decreases (medium confidence) and with increases over northwest China and South Korea 
(high confidence). Agricultural intensification through oasis expansion in Xinjiang region has increased 
summer precipitation in the Tianshan mountains (high confidence).  
 
GCMs still show poor performance in simulating the mean rainfall and its variability over East Asia, 
especially over regions characterized by complex topography. The CMIP6 models have improved from 
CMIP5 for climatological temperature and winter monsoon but show little improvements for the summer 
monsoon. The RCMs produce relatively more detailed regional features, but do not always produce superior 
simulations compared with the driving GCMs.  
 
The annual mean surface temperature over East Asia will very likely increase under all emissions scenarios 
and global warming levels. Larger warming magnitudes will likely occur in the northern part of EAS and in 
ECA. Precipitation is likely to increase over land in most of EAS at the end of the 21st century under higher 
emissions scenario (SSP3-7.0, RCP8.5, SSP5-8.5) and global warming levels and in ECA under all 
emissions scenarios and global warming levels. Summer precipitation increase is likely to occur in East Asia, 
corresponding to the strengthened summer monsoon circulation.  

## Atlas.5.2  North Asia 
 
### Atlas.5.2.1  Key features of the regional climate and findings from previous IPCC assessments 
 
#### Atlas.5.2.1.1  Key features of the regional climate 
North Asia extends from the Ural Mountains in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east and from the 
Russian Arctic in the north to Southwest Asia and East Asia in the south. Its most recognizable features are 
boreal forests and permafrost. In AR6 North Asia is divided into three reference regions (Figure Atlas.17:): 
West Siberia (WSB) with a continental climate, warm summers and cold winters, many waterlogged areas 
and several natural zones due to a large extent from south to north and heterogeneity in regional climates; 
East Siberia (ESB) which is mainly highland with extensive permafrost and a more severe continental 
climate characterised by harsh, long winters and short, hot summers, and by less precipitation and snow 
cover than in neighbouring regions; and the Russian Far East (RFE) with a monsoon-influenced climate, cold 
winters and wet summers in the south and cold winters and cool summers almost without precipitation in the 
north. WSB and ESB are mainly influenced by NAO and NAM (Annex IV.2.1) and AO with associated 
atmospheric blocking by the Siberian High that exhibits a pronounced decadal-to-multidecadal variability 
(see also Table Atlas.1). RFE is under the influence of the ENSO (Annex IV.2.3) and the PDV (Annex 
IV.2.6) that mostly affect rainfall variability. 
 
 
#### Atlas.5.2.1.2  Findings from previous IPCC assessments 
In the previous IPCC assessment cycles, the three subregions comprising North Asia in this section along 
with Eastern Europe and the Asian Arctic were considered as either Northern Eurasia or Russia in AR4 and 
AR5. WGI AR5 stated that for North and Central Asia CMIP5 models had difficulty in representing 
climatological means of both temperature and precipitation, which is partly related to the scarceness of 
observational data in northern parts of the region and to issues related to the estimation of biases with coarse 
resolution models (Christensen et al., 2013). In CMIP3 projections under different RCP scenarios, North 
Asia temperatures increase more in winter (DJF) than summer (JJA) (Seneviratne et al., 2012). With most 
models projecting increased precipitation significantly above the 20-year natural variability, it was 
concluded that precipitation in northern Asia will very likely increase (Christensen et al., 2013). 
 
SRCCL identified aridisation of the climate in southern Eastern Siberia between 1976 and 2016 as causing 
an extension of the steppes polewards whilst climate change also extended the vegetation season, increasing 
forest productivity in most of boreal Siberia, but increasing risk of wildfire and tree mortality (Mirzabaev et 
al., 2019). SROCC noted the warming climate has caused permafrost thaw and loss of ground ice, and thus 
land subsidence and collapse, disturbing ecosystems and human infrastructure. Permafrost stability, 
hydrology and vegetation were also impacted by recent extensive fires burning into the organic soil layer 
(Meredith et al., 2019). SR1.5 noted that future, higher levels of warming lead to greater impacts in key 
systems such as the Siberian ecosystems, identified as one of the threatened systems (‘Reason for Concern 1 
– RFC1’) (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018) with impacts at 2°C expected to be greater than those at 1.5°C 
(medium confidence).  
 
 
### Atlas.5.2.2  Assessment and synthesis of observations, trends and attribution 
 
Increases in surface air temperature (SAT) have been observed since the mid-1970s over the whole of North 
Asia (Frolov et al., 2014), and particularly over the north-eastern part (Gruza et al., 2015) (see also Figure 
Atlas.18). Trends of annual SAT in the northern part of the region during the last decades were very likely 
twice as strong as the global average (Figure Atlas.11) (Frolov et al., 2014; Mokhov, 2015; Sherstyukov, 
2016) with trends in RFE of 0.8°C–1.2°C per decade for the 1976–2014 period and more intense warming 
strengthening from south to north observed in spring in ESB (Frolov et al., 2014; Ippolitov et al., 2014; 
Kokorev and Sherstiukov, 2015).  
 
Recent strong warming in polar regions (Section Atlas.11.2) was accompanied by cooling in winter in mid-
latitude regions particularly in the southern part of WSB and ESB (Cohen et al., 2014; Ippolitov et al., 2014; 
Gruza et al., 2015; Kharyutkina et al., 2016; Overland et al., 2016; Perevedentsev et al., 2017; Wegmann et 
al., 2018). These temperature decreases were strongly correlated with significant warming over the Barents-
Kara Sea (greater than 2.5°C per decade during 2003–2017) and sea-ice loss suggesting a causal link (Outten 
and Esau, 2012; Semenov et al., 2012; Overland et al., 2016; Semenov, 2016; Wegmann et al., 2018; 
Meleshko et al., 2019; Susskind et al., 2019) though recent studies (Blackport et al., 2019; Clark and Lee, 
2019) have shown that both phenomena result from mid-latitude circulation variability (see also Cross-
Chapter Box 10.1). In addition, significant warming in the last decade has halved the cooling trend in 
southern WSB from –0.6°C per decade during 1976–2012 to –0.3°C per decade during 1976–2018 (Frolov et 
al., 2014; Roshydromet, 2019) (high confidence).  
 
Annual precipitation totals very likely increased over North Asia in the last half century along with more 
heavy and less light precipitation, more freezing rain and less freezing drizzle (Wen et al., 2014; Groisman et 
al., 2016; Ye et al., 2017; Chernokulsky et al., 2019)(see Figure Atlas.11 and Interactive Atlas). The highest 
increase was observed over regions of Siberia and RFE with estimated trends of 10–25 mm per decade for 
the 1976–2014 period (Kokorev and Sherstiukov, 2015) or 5% per decade for the 1976–2018 period 
(Roshydromet, 2019). Increases over southern RFE are the largest (over 50 mm per decade) and mostly due 
to positive changes in convective precipitation intensity in the region in summer season (JJA) during 1966–
2016 (medium confidence) (Chernokulsky et al., 2019). A decreasing trend was observed in central WSB, 
northern ESB, the Baikal and Transbaikal regions, the Amur River region, and Primorie territories of RFE 
(the Kamchatka and Chukchi Peninsulas) with up to –20 mm per decade for the 1976–2014 period (Kokorev 
and Sherstiukov, 2015) or 15–20% per decade for the 1976–2018 period (Roshydromet, 2019). Overall, solid 
precipitation predominantly decreased in North Asia and very likely caused both less Snow Cover Extent 
(SCE) and Snow Water Equivalent (SWE), attributable to the anthropogenic influence with high confidence 
(Sections 2.3.2.2, 3.4.2).  
 
Snow characteristics depend on both temperature and precipitation, and observed trends over North Asia 
show large spatial heterogeneity and interannual variability (Figure Atlas.18:) leading to medium confidence 
that maximum snow depth has increased over Siberia, the Okhotsk sea coast and in southern RFE since 
1960s (Callaghan et al., 2011; Loginov et al., 2014), with trends during 1976–2016 of 1.8 cm (in WBS), 1.1 
cm (in ESB), and 4.6 cm (in RFE) per decade (Bulygina et al., 2017). Snow cover duration increased in 
Yakutia, Sakhalin Island and some other coastal areas of the Pacific Ocean in RFE during 1980–2009 
(Callaghan et al., 2011) and decreased in WSB and ESB (Bulygina et al., 2017; Roshydromet, 2019). 
However, Gorbatenko et al. (2019) reported that in southeastern WSB maximal snow depth has increased by 
5–20 cm and duration of steady snow cover by between 4 and 10 days during 1989–2016 (Figure Atlas.18).  
 
 
<figref>ATLAS.18</figref> 
 
### Atlas.5.2.3  Assessment of model performance 
 
Temperature trends and means derived from reanalysis datasets (JRA-25, MERRA) correctly represented 
temperature variability shown in observational data over the Asian territory of Russia for the 1976–2010 
period (Loginov et al., 2014). Assessment of CRU TS 3.22, CRUTEMP4, ERA-Interim and NCEP2 datasets 
against station data over North Asia for annual and seasonal air temperature has shown that the ERA-Interim 
reanalysis outperforms others for the 1981–2005 period (Kokorev and Sherstiukov, 2015). The latter 
reanalysis also underestimates summer precipitation and shows large wet biases over Northeast Asia during 
spring and underestimates mean seasonal temperature over northeast Asia in spring (MAM), autumn (SON), 
and winter (DJF) but overestimate it in summer (JJA) compared with the CRU dataset (medium confidence) 
(Ozturk et al., 2017; Top et al., 2021).  
 
GCMs capture the main synoptic processes affecting North Asia and the CMIP5 ensemble simulates the 
temporal evolution of the magnitude and position of the Siberian High (SH) over the period 1872–2005 (Fei 
and Yong-Qi, 2015). CMIP5 models simulate a weakened intensity of the winter SH and a strengthened 
interannual variability compared to observations (Fei and Yong-Qi, 2015). The characteristics of blocking 
events over the region (number, duration, intensity and frequency) were reasonably well reproduced by 
GCMs (Mokhov et al., 2014) and most overestimate the annual mean temperature over northern Eurasia 
(Interactive Atlas ). Biases in simulated annual surface air temperature simulation primarily come from 
winter (DJF) season and are relatively smaller in other seasons (Miao et al., 2014; Peng et al., 2019). Most 
GCMs capture the main decadal SAT trend (Miao et al., 2014) though CMIP5 GCMs fail to capture the 
decreasing temperature trend over East Siberia (Fei and Yong-Qi, 2015). Possible causes of GCMs inability 
to represent the recent slowdown of warming is discussed more in Cross-Chapter Box 3.1. For CMIP5, 
models with higher resolution do not always perform better than those with lower resolutions (medium 
confidence) (Miao et al., 2014). 
 
Sixteen CMIP5 model simulations of SAT variability over Eurasia were evaluated against CRU observations 
for permafrost subregions (Peng et al., 2019), showing a warm bias in northwest Eurasia capturing the 
climate warming over the 20th century and its acceleration during the late 20th century. CMIP5 GCMs 
generally underestimate daily temperature range compared with observations over north-eastern Russia 
(Sillmann et al., 2013; Lindvall and Svensson, 2015). Currently there is no literature on the CMIP6 ensemble 
over the region though a few single-model studies are available (Voldoire et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019b).  
 
There is very limited use of RCMs for North Asia. CORDEX-CAS covers North Asia except parts of RFE 
and ARCTIC-CORDEX the northern regions (Figure Atlas.6:). For CORDEX-CAS three RCMs (REMO, 
ALARO-0 and CLMcom) have been used and have warm biases for maximum temperatures, cold biases for 
minimum temperatures and a wet bias in the north during the winter (Top et al., 2021). Rain gauges, 
however, are known to have problems in terms of measuring properly solid precipitation (e.g., drifting snow) 
which can greatly affect the accuracy of precipitation observations over North Asia (Harris et al., 2014). 
 
 
### Atlas.5.2.4  Assessment and synthesis of projections 
 
CMIP5 and CMIP6 projections are consistent in the direction and ranges of surface temperature change 
which are higher than the global average and with ensemble mean warming of around 6°C for the 4°C GWL. 
Projected precipitation changes are also consistent with significant increases in winter, of up to 40% in the 
ensemble mean for the highest warming levels, and lower increases in summer except for WSB where 
changes are small and suggest drying at the 4°C GWL (Figure Atlas.17:, Interactive Atlas). 
 
The CMIP5 ensemble projects a warming of the annual mean SAT over northern Eurasia in the 21st century, 
likely in the range of 0.8°C–1.0°C (RCP2.6), 2.3°C–3.1°C (RCP4.5) and up to 7.2°C (RCP8.5) (Miao et al., 
2014; Peng et al., 2019). Mid-latitude permafrost subregions in Eurasia are projected to warm more than the 
global mean and non-permafrost territories, with ensemble area-averaged changes of 1.7°C (RCP2.6), 3.2°C 
(RCP4.5) or 6.4°C (RCP8.5) in 2081–2100 relative to 1986–2005 (Peng et al., 2019). 
 
Over the Central Asia CORDEX domain, RegCM4.3.5 simulations driven by two different CMIP5 GCMs 
(HadGEM2-ES and MPI-ESM-MR) project SAT warming for 2071–2100 relative to 1971–2000 of about 
3°C–4°C during the summer for RCP4.5 to over 7°C for all seasons for RCP8.5. Projected warming is most 
evident on the large continental Siberian Plateau with boreal and sub-boreal climates and biomes (i.e., taiga 
forests and tundra) during the winter season (Ozturk et al., 2017). The Voeikov Main Geophysical 
Observatory (MGO) RCM, driven by five CMIP5 GCMs for the RCP8.5 scenario, projects a faster increase 
in annual minimum temperature as compared with maximum temperature over the whole territory of Russia 
(Kattsov et al., 2017), and the smallest change in growing season lengths (i.e., periods with daily 
temperatures over 5°C, 10°C and 15°C) in the area of northern taiga in WSB and ESB comparable with other 
territories of Russia during the 21st century (Torzhkov et al., 2019). 
 
For precipitation, MGO RCM projections for the Arctic-CORDEX domain under the RCP8.5 scenario are 
for increases in annual totals for northern North Asia, a decrease in summer over ESB for 2006–2100 
relative to 1951–2005 and significant increases in the upper limit of intense precipitation over most of the 
region in winter (Kattsov et al., 2017; Khlebnikova et al., 2018). Other RCM projections show that in most 
seasons and for all future periods, precipitation in Siberia is not projected to change with respect to the 
1971–2000 period, except under the RCP8.5 scenario for the winter and autumn (Ozturk et al., 2017). This 
very limited and controversial evidence leads to low confidence in RCM precipitation projections for North 
Asia and since the projections of GCMs and ESMs are more physically consistent, assessment of future 
precipitation changes is based on CMIP5/CMIP6 presented in Figure Atlas.17: and the Interactive Atlas. 
 
### Atlas.5.2.5  Summary
 
Annual surface air temperature and precipitation have very likely increased and maximum snow depth has 
likely increased over most of North Asia since the mid-1970s. The highest warming has been found in spring 
in ESB and RFE, strengthening from south to north with linear trends of 0.8°C–1.2°C per decade over the 
1976–2014 period (high confidence). A temperature decrease was identified just in winter in the southern 
part of WSB and ESB as a result of natural variability, but halved from –0.6°C per decade in 1976–2012 to –
0.3°C per decade for the longer 1976–2018 period due to recent warmer winters (high confidence). Over 
North Asia annual precipitation increases with estimated trends of 5–15 mm per decade in the 1976–2014 
period have been recorded with an exception over the Kamchatka and the Chukchi Peninsulas where 
decreases up to –20 mm per decade in the same period have been found (medium confidence). Snow cover 
duration has very likely decreased over Siberia and increases in maximum snow depths of 1.8 cm, 1.1 cm, 
and 4.6 cm per decade have been observed for WSB, ESB, and RFE respectively from 1976 to 2016 (limited 
evidence). 
 
Most of the CMIP5 and some CMIP6 GCMs overestimate the annual mean air temperature and precipitation 
over North Asia region (medium confidence). GCMs generally represent the observed decadal temperature 
trend (medium confidence) and biases primarily come from the winter (DJF) season (high confidence). 
Results of a very limited number of RCMs applied over the whole region show that they have warmer biases 
for maximum and colder biases for minimum temperatures (medium agreement, limited evidence). Sparsity 
of observational data particularly in the northern part of ESB and the whole of the RFE results in low 
confidence in the assessments of model performance in North Asia. 
 
Surface air temperature and precipitation in North Asia are projected to increase further (high confidence) 
with warming higher than the global average and around 6°C at the 4°C GWL. Temperature change in 2080–
2099 relative to 1981–2000 is likely in the range of 3°C in summer to 4.9°C in winter under the RCP4.5 
scenario, and 5.6°C in summer to 9.7°C in winter under the RCP8.5 scenario. Precipitation is projected to 
increase with ensemble mean changes of 9% in summer under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 and of 22% and 
56% in winter respectively. 
 
 
## Atlas.5.3  South Asia 
 
### Atlas.5.3.1  Key features of the regional climate and findings from IPCC previous assessments 
 
#### Atlas.5.3.1.1  Key features of the regional climate 
The countries in this region are mostly semi-arid to arid and therefore depend heavily on the summer 
monsoon (June–September, JJAS) which is when most of the precipitation falls over the South Asia region 
(SAS) (Figure Atlas.17:). The topographic mechanical effect of the Tibetan Plateau (TIB) promotes moisture 
convergence downstream which triggers the early summer monsoon onset particularly over the Bay of 
Bengal and South China. In winter, Westerly Disturbances (WD) bring moisture from the Atlantic Ocean. 
The WD interaction with Himalayas causes precipitation over northern and western parts of South Asia that 
is crucial to maintain the glacier mass balance. The observed teleconnection patterns over SAS for 
temperature shows cooling effects during NAM and warming effect when in positive phase with ENSO, 
IOB, AMM and AMV (Annex IV). IOD also influences South Asian precipitation (Annex IV). 
 
 
#### Atlas.5.3.1.2  Findings from previous IPCC assessments 
Recent IPCC reports assessed that it is very likely that the mean annual temperature over South Asia has 
increased during the past century (Figure 2.21 in Hartmann et al., 2013, Figure 24-2 in Hijioka et al., 2014), 
and the frequency of cold (warm) days and nights have decreased (increased) across most of Asia since 
about 1950 (Figure 2.32 in Hartmann et al., 2013). AR5 assessed that there is high confidence that the large-
scale patterns of surface temperature are generally well simulated by the CMIP5 models though with 
problems in some regions, particularly at higher elevations over the Himalayas (Flato et al., 2013). CMIP5 
models projected for the 21st century a significant increase in temperature over South Asia (high confidence 
from robust evidence) and in projections of increased summer monsoon precipitation (medium confidence) 
(Collins et al., 2013). AR5 assessed there is high confidence that high-resolution regional downscaling, 
which generate results complementary to those from global climate models, adds value to the simulation of 
spatial variations in climate in regions with highly variable topography (e.g., distinct orography, coastlines), 
and for mesoscale phenomena and extremes (Flato et al., 2013). 
 
Inconsistent evidence was found on the declining trends in mean precipitation and increasing droughts from 
1950 onwards considering 1960–1990 as the baseline period. Similarly, SREX (Table 3-3 in Seneviratne et 
al., 2012) reported low confidence (due to lack of literature) in trends in climate indices related to extreme 
precipitation events. The Indian summer monsoon circulation was found to have weakened, but this was 
compensated by increased local atmospheric moisture content leading to more rainfall (medium confidence). 
It is likely that the occurrence of snowfall events is decreasing in South Asia along with other regions due to 
an increase in winter temperatures (Hock et al., 2019b). Based on satellite- and surface-based remote sensing 
it is very likely that aerosol optical depth has increased over southern Asia since 2000. 
 
 
### Atlas.5.3.2  Assessment and synthesis of observations, trends and attribution 
 
Recent studies show that annual mean land temperatures over India warmed at a rate of around 0.6°C per 
century during 1901–2018, which was primarily contributed by a significant increase in annual maximum 
temperature of 1.0°C per century, while the annual minimum temperature showed a lesser increasing trend of 
0.18°C per century during this period, with significant rise only in the recent few decades (1981–2010) at a 
rate of 0.17°C per decade (Srivastava et al., 2017, 2019). The annual average of daily maximum and 
minimum temperatures has increased over almost all Pakistan with a faster increasing trend in the south 
(high confidence). Minimum temperatures have increased faster (0.17°C–0.37°C per decade) than maximum 
temperatures (0.17°C–0.29°C per decade) with the diurnal temperature range reduced (–0.15°C to –0.08°C 
per decade) in some regions (Khan et al., 2019).  
 
There has been a noticeable declining trend in rainfall with monsoon deficits occurring with higher 
frequency in different regions in South Asia (see also Section 8.3.2.4 on the South Asian monsoon). 
Concurrently, the frequency of heavy precipitation events has increased over India, while the frequency of 
moderate rain events has decreased since 1950 (high confidence) (Goswami et al., 2006; Dash et al., 2009; 
Christensen et al., 2013; Krishnan et al., 2016; Kulkarni et al., 2017; Roxy et al., 2017). There is a 
considerable spread in the seasonal and annual mean precipitation climatology and interannual variability 
among the different observed precipitation datasets over India (Collins et al., 2013; Prakash et al., 2014; Kim 
et al., 2018; Ramarao et al., 2018). Yet, the regions of agreement among datasets lend high confidence that 
there has been a decrease in mean rainfall over most parts of the eastern and central north regions of India 
(Singh et al., 2014; Roxy et al., 2015; Juneng et al., 2016; Krishnan et al., 2016; Guhathakurta and 
Revadekar, 2017; Jin and Wang, 2017; Latif et al., 2017). A global modelling study with high resolution 
over South Asia (Sabin et al., 2013) indicated that a juxtaposition of regional land-use changes, 
anthropogenic-aerosol forcing and the rapid warming signal of the equatorial Indian Ocean was crucial to 
simulate the observed Indian summer monsoon weakening in recent decades (medium confidence). 
 
A dipole-like structure in summer monsoon rainfall trends is observed over the northern Indo-Pakistan area 
with significant increases over Pakistan and decreases over central north India resulting from strengthening 
(weakening) of vertically integrated meridional moisture transport over the Arabian Sea (Bay of Bengal) 
(low confidence) (Latif et al., 2017). Positive annual precipitation trends are observed in global and regional 
datasets (Figure Atlas.11: and Interactive Atlas) during 1960–2015 and over arid provinces of Pakistan (for 
Rabi and Kharif cropping seasons) during 1951–2015 of 2.8–34.8 mm per decade (Khan et al., 2020) imply 
high confidence for increased precipitation in Pakistan. Observations located in the monsoon-dominated strip 
in Pakistan indicate that the mean monsoon onset became earlier during 1971–2010 (Ali et al., 2020). 
 
Snow and glaciers are the main water resources of all countries in South Asia. Glacier melting is mainly 
controlled by natural phenomena but anthropogenic emissions of black carbon (BC) are now making a 
significant contributing to total glacial melting in the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region (Menon, 2002; 
Ramanathan et al., 2007; Ramanathan and Carmichael, 2008). BC concentration is seven to ten times higher 
in mid-altitudes (1000–4000 metres above sea level) than at high altitudes (>4000 metres above sea level). 
The concentration of BC sampled from the surface of snow/ice samples as well as ice core records shows 
decreasing ice albedo and an acceleration in glacier melting (Wester et al., 2019) (see also Cross-Chapter 
Box 10.4). Karakoram and western HKH snow cover is increasing, a phenomena known as the ‘Karakoram 
anomaly’, and partially attributed to an increase in strength of westerly disturbances (Wester et al., 2019). 
 
Significant glacier retreat has been observed since 1960 in TIB with lower rates in the interior of the region 
(Yao et al., 2007). A large interdecadal variation in snow cover is also observed from 1960 to 2010. 
Observations and model simulations showed that the increasing temperature of frozen grounds is leading to 
thawing and reduced depth of permafrost, with further significant reductions projected under future global 
warming scenarios (Yang et al., 2019) (medium confidence).  
 
 
### Atlas.5.3.3  Assessment of model performance 
 
Whilst simulations of Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) have improved in CMIP5 compared to 
CMIP3 in terms of northward propagation, time for peak monsoon and withdrawal (Sperber et al., 2013) 
they fail to simulate the trends in monsoon rainfall and the post-1950 weakening of monsoon circulation 
(Saha et al., 2014). This is partially attributed to the failure of coarse resolution CMIP5 models to simulate 
fine-resolution processes such as orographic effects or land surface feedback, and problems in cloud 
parameterization result in an overestimation of convective precipitation fraction (Singh et al., 2017a). In 
CMIP6, a significant improvement is found in capturing the monsoon spatiotemporal patterns over India, 
particularly in the Western Ghats and north-eastern Himalayan foothills (Gusain et al., 2020). Over Pakistan 
the CMIP6 models simulate surface temperature better in JJA than DJF (Karim et al., 2020). The CMIP6 
ensemble underestimates annual mean temperature over all of South Asian with mixed results for 
precipitation (Almazroui et al., 2020c). The CMIP6 GCMs have a large cold bias in both mean annual 
maximum and minimum temperatures in the complex Karakorum and Himalayan mountain ranges but 
exhibit warm biases in mean annual minimum temperature in most of the rest of South Asia. 
 
Regional climate model (RCM) downscaling of CMIP5 models as part of CORDEX South Asia uses higher 
resolution (50 km) and improved surface fields such as topography and coastlines to resolve better the 
complexities of the monsoon and other hydrological processes (Giorgi et al., 2009). The added value of their 
simulations, relative to the driving GCMs, presents a complex picture. CORDEX RCMs better represent 
spatial patterns of temperature (Sanjay et al., 2017), the spatial features of precipitation distribution 
associated with the Indian summer monsoon (Choudhary and Dimri, 2018) and the simulation of monsoon 
active- and break-phase composite precipitation (Karmacharya et al., 2016). The RCMs follow the driving 
GCMs in underestimating seasonal mean surface air temperature and overestimating spatial variability in 
precipitation. They amplify CMIP5 cold biases over almost the entire region, including over the HKH 
region, Afghanistan and southwest Pakistan during winter (Iqbal et al., 2017) and substantial cold biases of 
6°C–10°C are found over the Himalayan watersheds of the Indus Basin (Nengker et al., 2018; Hasson et al., 
2019). Neither RCMs nor their driving CMIP5 GCMs reproduce well the region’s precipitation climatology 
(Mishra, 2015). In addition, important characteristics of ISMR such as northward and eastward propagation, 
onset, seasonal rainfall patterns, intra-seasonal oscillations and patterns of extremes did not show consistent 
improvement (Singh et al., 2017b). Also, these RCM simulations have not demonstrated added value in 
capturing the observed changes in ISMR characteristics over recent decades though RegCM4 simulations at 
25 km showed high accuracy in capturing monsoon precipitation characteristics and atmospheric dynamics 
in historical simulations (Ashfaq et al., 2020).  
 
Evaluation of four global reanalysis products (ERA5 and ERA-Interim, JRA-55 and MERRA-2, Section 
Atlas.1.4.2) for snow depth and snow cover over the TIB was performed against 33 in situ station 
observations, Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) snow cover and a satellite 
microwave snow depth dataset (Orsolini et al., 2019). Most of the reanalyses showed a systematic 
overestimation. Only ERA-Interim assimilated IMS snow cover at high altitudes, whereas ERA5 did not and 
the excessive snowfall, snow depth and snow cover in ERA5 was attributed to this difference. The analysis 
of annual maximum consecutive snow-covered days for the period 1980–2018 over TIB using JRA-55 and 
Passive Microwave satellite observations showed decreasing trend in all time periods and in recent snow 
seasons for MERRA-2 (Bian et al., 2020). The uncertainty assessment of model physics in snow modelling 
over TIB using ground-based observations and high-resolution snow-cover satellite products from the 
Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and FengYun-3B (FY3B) suggests that errors 
can be overcome by optimizing parameterizations of the snow cover fraction rather than optimizing physics-
scheme options (Jiang et al., 2020b). 
 
 
### Atlas.5.3.4  Assessment and synthesis of projections 
 
CMIP5 and CMIP6 surface temperature projections are consistent across the range of global warming levels 
with increases greater than the global average, more so over TIB (Figure Atlas.17:). CMIP6 models show 
higher sensitivity to greenhouse gas emissions, projecting higher warming for a given emission scenario. The 
north-western parts of South Asia, mainly covering Karakorum and Himalayan mountain ranges, are 
projected to warm more (over 6°C under SSP5-8.5, with higher warming in winters than in summer, see 
Interactive Atlas) and this will accelerate glacier melting in the region. The warming pattern of maximum 
and minimum temperatures are projected to intensify in higher latitudes compared with mid-latitudes of 
South Asia in CMIP5 simulations for all RCP scenarios (Ullah et al., 2020).  
 
Seasonal precipitation projections show increased winter precipitation over the western Himalayas and 
decreased precipitation over the eastern Himalayas. On the other hand, summer precipitation projections 
show a robust increase over most of South Asia, with the largest over the arid region of southern Pakistan 
and adjacent areas of India, under SSP5-8.5 (Almazroui et al., 2020c). Daily bias-adjusted projections from 
13 CMIP6 GCMs using all emission scenarios project a warmer (3°C–5°C) and wetter (13–30%) climate in 
South Asia in the 21st century (Mishra et al., 2020). 
 
With continued global warming and anticipated reductions in anthropogenic aerosol emissions in the future, 
CMIP5 models project an increase in the mean and variability of summer monsoon precipitation over India 
by the end of the 21st century, together with substantial increases in daily precipitation extremes (medium 
confidence) (Gnanaseelan et al., 2020), see also Section 8.4.2.4 on changes in the South Asian monsoon. The 
CMIP5 GCMs consistently project an increase in the moisture transport over the Arabian Sea and Bay of 
Bengal towards the end of 21st century, an increase in moisture convergence and consequent increases in 
monsoon rainfall over the Indo-Pakistan region which are higher under RCP8.5 thanRCP4.5 (Srivastava and 
Delsole, 2014; Mei et al., 2015; Latif, 2017). Out of 20 CMIP5 GCMs, four showed an increase in 
magnitude and lengthening of all-India summer monsoon under RCP8.5. The intensity of both strong and 
weak monsoons is projected to increase during the period 2051–2099 (Srivastava and Delsole, 2014).  
 
Summer precipitation changes in South Asia are consistent between CMIP3 and CMIP5 projections, but the 
model spread is large for winter precipitation changes. Changes in summer monsoon rainfall will dominate 
annual changes over South Asia (Woo et al., 2019). CMIP3 GCMs project a gradual increase in annual 
precipitation over monsoon-dominated areas of Pakistan throughout the 21st Century and increases in humid 
and semi-arid climate areas (Saeed and Athar, 2018).  
 
Warming of 2.5°C to 5°C is projected over northern Pakistan and India (Syed et al., 2014). CORDEX-South 
Asia projections over northeast India under RCP4.5 for the period 2011–2060, show increasing trends for 
both seasonal maximum and minimum temperature over northeast India (Interactive Atlas). The future 
projections of South Asian monsoon from the CORDEX-CORE exhibit a spatially robust delay in the 
monsoon onset, an increase in seasonality, and a reduction in the rainy season length over parts of South 
Asia at higher levels of radiative forcing (Ashfaq et al., 2020).  
 
With the TIB continuing to warm, snow cover and snow water equivalent are projected to decrease but with 
regional differences due to synoptic influences (Wester et al., 2019) and Cross-Chapter Box 10.4. There is 
limited evidence on whether the ‘Karakoram Anomaly’ will persist in coming decades, but its long-term 
persistence is unlikely with continued projected warming (high confidence) (Section 9.5.1.1). It is projected 
that peak river flow at higher altitudes will commence earlier, due to warming influences on snow cover area 
and snow/glacier melt rates and with more precipitation falling as rain rather than snow, and the magnitude 
and seasonality of flow will change over South Asia (Charles et al., 2016). 
 
### Atlas.5.3.5  Summary 
 
Mean, minimum and maximum daily temperatures in South Asia are increasing and winters are getting 
warmer faster than summers (high confidence). The South Asian monsoon has shown contrasting behaviour 
over India and Pakistan. There is high confidence that there has been a decrease in mean rainfall over most 
parts of the eastern and central north regions of India and an increase in precipitation in Pakistan.  
 
Global model performance over the region has improved from CMIP3 to CMIP5 to CMIP6 in the multi-
model ensemble mean simulation of the amplitude and phase of the seasonal cycles of temperature and 
precipitation. However, there was no appreciable improvement in regions with steep orography, and there 
has remained substantial inter-model spread in seasonal and annual mean temperatures over South Asia with 
generally cold biases which are largest in the complex Karakorum and Himalayan mountain ranges. CMIP6 
GCMs also show a dry bias (15–20%) in mean annual precipitation in the majority of South Asia region with 
a wet bias in Nepal, Pakistan and northern India.  
 
It is likely that surface temperatures over South Asia (SAS and TIB) will increase greater than the global 
average, more so over TIB, and with projected increases of 4.6°C (3.4°C– 6.0°C) during 2081–2100 
compared with 1995–2014 under SSP5-8.5 and 1.3°C (0.7°C– 2.0°C) under SSP1-2.6 (Interactive Atlas). 
Summer monsoon precipitation in South Asia is likely to increase by the end of the 21st century while winter 
monsoons are projected to be drier. Over the same time periods CMIP6 models project an increase in annual 
precipitation in the range 14–36% under SSP5-8.5 and 0.4–16% under SSP1-2.6 (medium confidence).  
 
With continued warming, TIB snow cover and snow water equivalent are likely to decrease and with more 
precipitation falling as rain rather than snow in SAS. It is projected that the peak river flow at higher 
altitudes will commence earlier due to the effect of warming on snow cover and snow/glacier melt rates, 
causing changes in magnitude and seasonality of flow.  
 
 
## Atlas.5.4  Southeast Asia 
 
### Atlas.5.4.1  Key features of the regional climate and findings from previous IPCC assessments 
 
#### Atlas.5.4.1.1  Key features of the regional climate 
The Southeast Asia region is composed of countries that are part of Indochina (or mainland Southeast Asia) 
and countries that are very archipelagic in nature and have strong land-ocean-atmosphere interactions, 
including those that are part of the Maritime Continent and the Philippines. Its climate is mainly tropical 
(i.e., hot and humid with abundant rainfall). Rainfall seasonal variability in the region is mainly affected by 
the synoptic-scale monsoon systems, the north-south migration of the ITCZ and tropical cyclones (mainly 
for the Philippines and Indochina) while intraseasonal variability can be influenced by the MJO (Annex IV). 
Temperature and especially rainfall are also interannually affected by ENSO and Indian Ocean Basin and 
Dipole (IOB/IOD) modes (Annex IV, Table Atlas.1).  
 
 
#### Atlas.5.4.1.2  Findings from previous IPCC assessments 
WGI AR5 showed that the mean annual temperature of Southeast Asia has been increasing at a rate of 
0.14°C to 0.20°C per decade since the 1960s, along with an increasing number of warm days and nights, and 
a decreasing number of cold days and nights (Christensen et al., 2013). AR5 also reported the lack of 
sufficient observational records to allow for a full understanding of past precipitation trends in most of the 
Asian region, including Southeast Asia, and that precipitation trends that were available differed 
considerably across the region and between seasons (Christensen et al., 2013).  
 
On projected changes, findings from AR5 showed that warming is very likely to continue with substantial 
subregional variations over Southeast Asia (Christensen et al., 2013). The median increase in temperature 
over land projected by the CMIP5 ensemble mean ranges from 0.8°C in RCP2.6 to 3.2°C in RCP8.5 by the 
end of the 21st century. Moderate future increases in precipitation are very likely, with projected ensemble 
mean increases of 1% in RCP2.6 to 8% in RCP8.5 by 2100. In the SR1.5, there is a projected increase in 
flooding and runoff over Southeast Asia for a 1.5°C to 2°C global warming, and these will increase even 
more for a greater than 2°C level of warming (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). 
 
 
### Atlas.5.4.2  Assessment and synthesis of observations, trends and attribution 
 
Within the last decade, there has been an increasing number of studies on climatic trends over Southeast 
Asia, carried out on a regional basis (Thirumalai et al., 2017; Cheong et al., 2018) or focused on specific 
countries (Cinco et al., 2014; Villafuerte et al., 2014; Mayowa et al., 2015; Villafuerte and Matsumoto, 2015; 
Guo et al., 2017a; Sa’adi et al., 2017; Supari et al., 2017; Tan et al., 2021). They document virtually certain 
significant increases in mean as well as extreme temperature. The minimum temperature extremes very likely 
warmed faster compared to the maximum temperature. Temperatures, including extremes, are strongly 
influenced by ENSO in the region (Cinco et al., 2014; Thirumalai et al., 2017; Cheong et al., 2018). Over 
much of the regions, extreme high temperature occurred mostly in April and almost all April extreme 
temperatures occur in El Niño years (Thirumalai et al., 2017). In most of Southeast Asia (except for the 
north-eastern areas), there was likely an increase in the number of warm nights with El Niño episodes within 
the period 1972–2010 (Cheong et al., 2018).  
 
Changes in mean precipitation are less spatially coherent over Southeast Asia. Over Thailand, the average 
number of rain days has decreased by 1.3 to 5.9 days per decade while average daily rainfall intensity has 
increased by 0.24–0.73 mm day–1 per decade (Limsakul and Singhruck, 2016). Precipitation is also affected 
by ENSO events (Tangang et al., 2017; Supari et al., 2018). Over Southeast Asia, there has been a significant 
increase in the amount of precipitation and its extremes with La Niña episodes in the past decades, especially 
during the winter monsoon period (high confidence) (Villafuerte and Matsumoto, 2015; Limsakul and 
Singhruck, 2016; Cheong et al., 2018).  
 
Figure Atlas.11 shows trends in mean temperature and precipitation during 1960–2015 for two global 
datasets, indicating a significant overall warming over Southeast Asia (high confidence), with higher rates of 
warming in Malaysia, Indonesia, and the southern areas of mainland Southeast Asia (low confidence). 
Annual mean precipitation trends (see also Interactive Atlas which includes the regional dataset Aphrodite, 
see section Atlas.1.4.1) over the region are mostly not significant except for increases over parts of Malaysia, 
Vietnam and southern Philippines (medium confidence). 

It is important to note that the availability, quality, and temporal and spatial density of observation data may 
lead to uncertainties and varying results in Southeast Asia (Juneng et al., 2016). Some efforts have been 
made to produce better observationally-based gridded datasets for the region (e.g., Nguyen-Xuan et al., 
2016; van den Besselaar et al., 2017; Yatagai et al., 2020). 
 
 
### Atlas.5.4.3  Assessment of model performance 
 
Performance in simulating rainfall over Southeast Asia varies among CMIP5 GCMs (high confidence). Only 
some are capable of reasonably simulating the rainfall seasonal cycle and spatial pattern (Siew et al., 2013; 
Raghavan et al., 2018). Over mainland Southeast Asia, the performance of CMIP5 GCMs in simulating 
rainfall during wet season was superior to that for annual and dry season precipitation (Li et al., 2019a).  
 
RCMs have been intensively used over the region in recent years in a series of single or multi-model 
experiments and there is medium confidence that they reproduce reasonably well seasonal climate patterns of 
temperature, precipitation and large-scale circulation over the different subregions of Southeast Asia with 
added values compared to their host GCMs (Van Khiem et al., 2014; Kwan et al., 2014; Ngo-Duc et al., 
2014, 2017; Juneng et al., 2016; Katzfey et al., 2016; Loh et al., 2016; Raghavan et al., 2016; Cruz et al., 
2017; Ratna et al., 2017; Trinh-Tuan et al., 2018; Nguyen‐Thuy et al., 2021). RCM ensemble means tend to 
outperform the individual models in representing the climatological mean state (Ngo-Duc et al., 2014; Trinh-
Tuan et al., 2018; Nguyen‐Thi et al., 2020). There is relatively high consistency among the simulations of 
historical climate over mainland Southeast Asia compared to those over the Maritime Continent for both 
seasonal and inter-annual variability (Ngo-Duc et al., 2017). The consistency in rainfall simulations was 
lower than for temperature simulations.  
 
Some RCMs showed a systematic cold bias (Manomaiphiboon et al., 2013; Kwan et al., 2014; Ngo-Duc et 
al., 2014; Loh et al., 2016; Cruz and Sasaki, 2017; Cruz et al., 2017) that was mainly due to model physics 
(Manomaiphiboon et al., 2013; Kwan et al., 2014) and/or the biases in the SST forcing (Ngo-Duc et al., 
2014). A few simulations revealed a warm bias over some areas such as in the Maritime Continent (Cruz et 
al., 2017) or Vietnam (Van Khiem et al., 2014). The biases for rainfall in GCMs and RCMs over Southeast 
Asia were found to be less systematic with wet or dry biases depending on the subregions (Manomaiphiboon 
et al., 2013; Kwan et al., 2014; Van Khiem et al., 2014; Juneng et al., 2016; Nguyen‐Thi et al., 2020; Supari 
et al., 2020; Tangang et al., 2020) although wet biases were more pronounced in RCMs (Kwan et al., 2014; 
Van Khiem et al., 2014; Kirono et al., 2015; Juneng et al., 2016; Supari et al., 2020; Tangang et al., 2020). 
Some RCMs overestimated rainfall interannual variability (Juneng et al., 2016) while some others 
underestimated it (Kirono et al., 2015). Simulated rainfall amount is sensitive to the choice of convective 
scheme (Juneng et al., 2016; Ngo-Duc et al., 2017) and the choice of land-surface scheme (Chung et al., 
2018). Rainfall biases in current climate simulations can be greatly reduced if a bias correction method such 
as quantile mapping is applied (Trinh-Tuan et al., 2018). The pattern of tropical cyclone numbers in the 
region were reasonable represented by RCM outputs (Van Khiem et al., 2014; Kieu-Thi et al., 2016; 
Herrmann et al., 2020).  
 
 
### Atlas.5.4.4  Assessment and synthesis of projections 
 
Mean temperature in Southeast Asia is projected to continue to rise through the 21st century (virtually 
certain, very high confidence). Projections by multi-model regional climate simulations of CORDEX-SEA 
showed a temperature increment over land under RCP8.5 to range from 3°C to 5°C by the end of 21st 
century relative to pre-1986–2005 period (Tangang et al., 2018). For the same periods, the average mean 
temperature increase over land projected by CMIP5 (CMIP6) varies from 0.9 ± 0.3°C (1.2 ± 0.4°C) under 
RCP2.6 (SSP1-2.6) to 3.5 ± 0.7°C (3.8 ± 0.9°C) under RCP8.5 (SSP5-8.5) (Interactive Atlas). For all Global 
Warming Levels (GWLs) the land region is projected to warm by a slightly smaller amount than the global 
average, with 10th–90th percentile ranges for CMIP5 (CMIP6) of 1.2°C to 1.6°C (1.2°C to 1.5°C) for the 
1.5°C GWL and of 3.3°C to 4.0°C (3.3°C to 3.9°C) for the 4°C GWL relative to the 1850–1900 baseline 
(calculated from RCP8.5 (SSP5-8.5) projections). Changes for other warming levels, periods, and emissions 
pathways are shown in Figure Atlas.17 and can be explored in the Interactive Atlas.  
 
Projections of future rainfall changes are highly variable among sub-regions of Southeast Asia and among 
the models (high confidence). The CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensembles showed an increase in annual mean 
precipitation over most land areas by the mid and late 21st century, although only with a strong model 
agreement for higher warming levels (Interactive Atlas, Figure Atlas.17), while CORDEX produces a 
general decrease in projected precipitation (Figure Atlas.17). Based on CORDEX Southeast Asia multi-
model simulations, significant and robust increases of mean rainfall over Indochina and the Philippines were 
projected while there is a drying tendency over the Maritime Continent during DJF for the early, mid and 
end of the 21st century periods under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (Tangang et al., 2020) (Figure Atlas.19). At 
the end of the 21st century during DJF and under RCP8.5, an increase of 20% in mean rainfall is projected 
over Myanmar, northern central Thailand and northern Laos, and of 5–10% over the eastern Philippines and 
northern Vietnam. During JJA, significant drier conditions are projected over almost the entire Southeast 
Asia except over Myanmar and northern Borneo. Over the Indonesian region, especially Java, Sumatra and 
Kalimantan, as much as a 20–30% decrease in mean rainfall is projected during JJA by the end of the 21st 
century. The projected drier condition over Indonesia from CORDEX is consistent with that of (Kusunoki, 
2017; Giorgi et al., 2019; Kang et al., 2019; Supari et al., 2020) and is associated with enhanced subsidence 
over the region (Kang et al., 2019; Tangang et al., 2020).  
 
<figref>ATLAS.19</figref> 
 
### Atlas.5.4.5  Summary 
 
It is virtually certain that annual mean temperature has been increasing in Southeast Asia in the past decades 
while changes in annual mean precipitation are less spatially coherent though with some increasing trends 
over parts of Malaysia, Vietnam and southern Philippines (medium confidence).  
 
Although various biases still exist, there is high confidence that the models can reproduce seasonal climate 
patterns well over the different subregions of Southeast Asia. There is medium confidence that the RCMs 
show added value compared to their host GCMs over the region.  
 
Projections show continued warming over Southeast Asia, but likely by a slightly smaller amount than the 
global average. Projected changes in rainfall over Southeast Asia vary, depending on model, subregion and 
season (high confidence) with consistent projections of increases in annual mean rainfall from CMIP5 and 
CMIP6 over most land areas (medium confidence) and decreases in summer rainfall from CORDEX 
projections over much of Indonesia (medium confidence).  
 
 
## Atlas.5.5  Southwest Asia 
 
### Atlas.5.5.1  Key features of the regional climate and findings from previous IPCC assessments 
 
#### Atlas.5.5.1.1  Key features of the regional climate 
Southwest Asia includes the Arabian Peninsula (ARP) and West Central Asia (WCA) reference regions 
(Figure Atlas.17). ARP has a semi-arid or arid desert climate with very low annual mean precipitation and 
very high temperature. Its temperature is influenced by SST variations over the tropical ocean (e.g., ENSO) 
and the NAO and AO (Attada et al., 2019) (see Annex IV for these and subsequent modes of variability). 
Rainfall is influenced by the IOD and ENSO with more rainfall during El Niño (Kang et al., 2015; Kumar et 
al., 2015; Abid et al., 2018; Kamil et al., 2019) and less during La Niña (Atif et al., 2020). The wet season in 
ARP is mainly from November to April and the dry season is from June to August. Rainfall is confined 
mostly to the south-western part of the Peninsula and contribution of extreme events to the total rainfall 
varies within 20–70% from region to region and season to season (Almazroui, 2020b; Almazroui and Saeed, 
2020). WCA is separated from Eastern Europe by the Caucasus Mountains, is adjacent to ARP, with South 
Asia (SAS) to the south and West Siberia (WSB) to the north, and lies between the Mediterranean (MED), 
Tibetan Plateau (TIB) and East Central Asia (ECA) regions. WCA is heterogeneous in terrain with the 
Zagros Mountains and Iranian Plateau in the west and southwest, the Caspian Sea and lowland with deserts 
in the north and northeast. The regional climate of WCA is influenced by the NAO and ENSO and it is 
typically semi-arid or arid with a strong gradient in both precipitation and temperature from the mountains to 
the plains and from north to south.  
 
 
#### Atlas.5.5.1.2  Findings from previous IPCC assessments 
The IPCC AR5 established it is very likely that temperatures will continue to increase over WCA in all 
seasons whilst projections of decreased annual mean precipitation had medium confidence due to medium 
agreement resulting from model-dependent subregional and seasonal changes (Christensen et al., 2013). 
AR5 also concluded that for a better understanding of the climate of the region, results of high-resolution 
regional climate models also need to be assessed and CMIP5 models generally had difficulties simulating the 
mean temperature and precipitation climatology for Southwest Asia. This is partly related to the poor spatial 
resolution of the models not resolving the complex mountainous terrain and the influence of different drivers 
of the European, Asian and African climates. However, observational data scarsity and issues related to the 
comparison of observations with coarse-resolution models added to the uncertainty and remained poorly 
analysed in peer-reviewed literature on climate model performance (Christensen et al., 2013). 
 
SR1.5 stated that even for 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming, Southwest Asia is among the regions with the 
strongest projected increase in hot extremes with more urban populations exposed to severe droughts in West 
Asia, while an increase of heavy precipitation events is projected in mountainous regions of Central Asia 
(Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; IPCC, 2018c). Higher temperatures with less precipitation will likely result in 
higher risks of desertification, wildfire and dust storms exacerbated by land-use and land-cover changes in 
the region with consequent effects on human health. Further drying of the Aral Sea in Central Asia will likely 
have negative effects on the regional microclimate adding to the growing wind erosion in adjacent deltaic 
areas and deserts that is already resulting in a reduction of the vegetation productivity including croplands. 
There is also a projected increase of precipitation intensity in the Arabian Peninsula which is likely to lead to 
higher soil erosion particularly in winter and spring due to floods (Mirzabaev et al., 2019). WCA includes 
high mountains with enhanced warming above 500 m where, regardless of the emissions scenario, decreases 
in snow cover are projected due to increased winter snowmelt and more precipitation falling as rain (high 
confidence). A very strong interannual and decadal variability, as well as scarce in situ records for mountain 
snow cover, have prevented a quantification of recent trends in High Mountain Asia (Hock et al., 2019b). 
 
 
### Atlas.5.5.2  Assessment and synthesis of observations, trends and attribution 
 
Since the AR5, there has been an increasing number of studies on past climate change in Southwest Asia 
though meteorological stations are sparsely scattered in the region. They are mainly located in the plains 
below 2 km of altitude, very scarce in mountainous areas and have declined in number in WCA since the end 
of the Soviet Union in 1991. This increases the uncertainty in both temperature and precipitation trends 
particularly for elevated areas (Christensen et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2014) (high confidence). So researchers 
use other sources of climate data in the region, particularly freely available gridded data (see Annex I).  
 
Globally drylands showed an enhanced warming over the past century of 1.2°C to 1.3°C, significantly higher 
than the warming over humid lands (0.8°C to 1.0°C) (Huang et al., 2017b). A strong increase in annual 
surface air temperature of 0.27°C to 0.47°C per decade has been found over WCA between 1960 and 2013 
(very high confidence) (Han and Yang, 2013; Li et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2014, 2017; Huang et al., 2014; Deng 
and Chen, 2017; Zhang et al., 2019a, 2017; Guo et al., 2018b; Haag et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2019). Warming is 
most prominent in the spring based on the CRU dataset with rates likely ranging from 0.64°C to 0.82°C per 
decade (Hu et al., 2014). Analysis of seasonal temperature trends based on high-resolution 1 km x 1 km 
downscaled dataset CHELSA and 20 stations in Uzbekistan has confirmed the maximum significant trend in 
temperature of from 0.6°C up to 1°C per decade in spring from 1979 to 2013 and no significant trend in 
winter (Khaydarov and Gerlitz, 2019). There is very high confidence (robust evidence, high agreement) that 
the shrinking of the Aral Sea has induced an increase in surface air temperature around the Aral Sea region 
in the range of 2°C to 6°C (Baidya Roy et al., 2014; McDermid and Winter, 2017; Sharma et al., 2018). The 
plateau of Iran has experienced significant increases in the average monthly values of daily maximum and 
minimum temperatures with spatially varying rates of 0.1°C–0.3°C up to 0.3°C–0.4°C per decade and 
greater spatial variation in minimum temperatures (high confidence) (Mahmoudi et al., 2019; Fathian et al., 
2020; Sharafi and Mir Karim, 2020).  
 
Observed warming over northern ARP is higher than over the south, where minimum temperatures are 
increasing faster than maximum temperatures (Almazroui, 2020a). The rate of mean temperature increase is 
estimated at 0.10°C per decade over 1901–2010 (Attada et al., 2019), while it has reached 0.63°C (likely in 
the range of 0.24°C to 0.81°C) per decade for the more recent period of 1978–2019 (Almazroui, 2020a).  
 
An overall increasing trend of annual precipitation (0.66 mm per decade) was found over Central Asia based 
on GPCC V7 data for the period 1901–2013 (Hu et al., 2017), but annual trends were found not significant 
over the shorter period 1960–2013 (see also Figure Atlas.11 and Interactive Atlas). Winter precipitation saw 
a significant increase of 1.1 mm per decade (Song and Bai, 2016). These estimates have low to medium 
confidence since the satellite precipitation products have large systematic and random errors in mountainous 
regions. Moreover CMORPH and TRMM products fail to capture the precipitation events in the ice/snow-
covered regions in winter and show a substantial false-alarm percentage in summer, but the gauge-corrected 
GSMAP performs better than other products (Song and Bai, 2016; Guo et al., 2017b; Hu et al., 2017; Chen et 
al., 2019b). Over the elevated part of eastern WCA precipitation increases in the range of 1.3–4.8 mm per 
decade during 1960–2013 were observed (very high confidence) (Han and Yang, 2013; Li et al., 2013; Hu et 
al., 2014, 2017; Huang et al., 2014; Deng and Chen, 2017; Zhang et al., 2019a, 2017; Guo et al., 2018b; 
Haag et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2019). Reductions in spring precipitation and increases in winter have been 
reported for Uzbekistan over the period 1979–2013 based on station data but these are not significant 
(Khaydarov and Gerlitz, 2019). There is very low confidence of impact of the Aral Sea shrinking on 
precipitation (Chen et al., 2011; Jin et al., 2017). 
 
A decreasing trend of precipitation is reported for ARP with the mean value of –6.3 mm per decade (range of 
–30 mm to 16 mm) for the period 1978–2019 (low confidence) with large interannual variability over Saudi 
Arabia, which covers 80% of the region (AlSarmi and Washington, 2011; Almazroui et al., 2012; Donat et 
al., 2014). The same decreasing trend in precipitation totals and an increasing trend in the number of 
consecutive dry days are found for most of the Iranian plateau (medium confidence) (Rahimi and Fatemi, 
2019; Fathian et al., 2020; Sharafi and Mir Karim, 2020). January-to-March mean snow cover and depth 
over mountainous areas decreased between 2000 and 2019 (low to medium confidence due to limited 
evidence) (Safarianzengir et al., 2020). 
 
 
### Atlas.5.5.3  Assessment of model performance 
 
There is limited evidence about the performance of GCMs and RCMs in representing the current climate of 
Southwest Asia due to very few studies evaluating models over this region, but literature is now emerging 
particularly on CMIP5/CMIP6 and CORDEX simulations.  
 
Over ARP, surface temperature biases for 18 of 30 CMIP5 models are within one standard deviation of the 
observed variability (Almazroui et al., 2017). A warm bias in summer and a cold bias for others months 
along with an underestimation of wet season precipitation and an overestimation in the dry season have been 
reported in 26 CMIP5 models (Lelieveld et al., 2016). 30 CMIP6 GCMs have limited skill in simulating 
annual precipitation patterns, annual cycle statistics and long-term precipitation trends over Central Asia 
partially due to considerable wet biases of up to 100% in the Southern Xinjiang and Hexi Corridor regions 
(Guo et al., 2021). Also, CMIP6 models display a wide range of performance in reproducing ENSO 
teleconnections that influences the region (Barlow et al., 2021). 
 
RCM simulations using the CORDEX-MENA domain reproduce the main features of the mean surface 
climatology over ARP with moderate biases (high confidence). RegCM4 driven by five GCMs (HadGEM2, 
GFDL, CNRM, CanESM2, and ECHAM6) showed an ensemble mean cold bias of about –0.7°C and dry 
bias of –13% over ARP (Almazroui, 2016) with a cold (warm) bias over western (south-eastern) areas (Syed 
et al., 2019). Temperature biases in 30-year historical simulations with WRF using three different radiation 
parameterizations were within ±2°C and mostly caused by surface long-wave radiation errors which affected 
night-time minimum temperatures over 70% of the domain (Zittis and Hadjinicolaou, 2017). Mean absolute 
errors in COSMO-CLM driven by ERA-Interim were about 1.2°C for temperature, 15 mm per month for 
precipitation and 9% for total cloud cover, and with new parameterizations of albedo and aerosols optimized 
for the region the RCM simulated the main climate features of this very complex area (Bucchignani et al., 
2016). RegCM4.4 also simulated the main features of the observed climatology (especially for dry regions) 
with temperature biases within ±3.0°C. Annual precipitation was overestimated with winter and spring 
underestimated (Ozturk et al., 2018). 
 
Four RCMs (REMO, RegCM4.3.5, ALARO-0, and COSMO-CLM5.0) driven by ERA-Interim, NCEP2 
reanalyses and two different GCMs reproduced reasonably well the spatio-temporal patterns for temperature 
and precipitation though underestimated diurnal temperature range and had cold biases over mountainous 
and high plateau regions in all seasons. There is low confidence in this result because of low station density 
and a lack of high-elevation stations and with biases dependent on the choice of the observational dataset. 
However, the performance of both GCMs and RCMs is better than reanalyses when compared to available 
observations (Mannig et al., 2013; Ozturk et al., 2017; Russo et al., 2019; Top et al., 2021). 
 
 
### Atlas.5.5.4  Assessment and synthesis of projections 
 
Temperature and precipitation projections from CMIP5/CMIP6 and CORDEX for different global warming 
levels, SSP and RCP scenarios, time periods and baselines are shown in Figure Atlas.17 and further details 
can be explored in the Interactive Atlas.  
 
In WCA, projections for different GWLs are consistent not only in annual and seasonal warming but in 
ranges of the projections. Under RCP8.5, annual mean temperature will likely exceed 2°C by mid-century 
(compared with 1995–2014) and reach up to 4.8°C–6°C by the end of the century (Yang et al., 2017) with 
faster warming projected by the CMIP6 ensemble under SSP5-8.5. In individual county-level studies on 
GCM future climate projections temperatures increased by up to 7°C by the end of the century, depending on 
season and emission scenario (Allaberdiyev, 2010; MENRPG, 2015; Vermishev, 2015; Gevorgyan et al., 
2016; Osborn et al., 2016; Aalto et al., 2017; IDOE, 2017; Salman et al., 2017). Statistical downscaling of 18 
CMIP5 GCMs projected an annual temperature increase of 0.37°C per decade (under RCP4.5) with the 
maximum in northern WCA and warming most conspicuous in summer (Luo et al., 2019). RCM 
downscaling of GCMs over Central Asia projected a larger increase of temperature under RCP8.5 for the 
2071–2100 period, ranging from 5°C to 8°C (Ozturk et al., 2017).  
 
In ARP, the projected change in ensemble mean annual temperature from 30 CMIP6 models is from 1.6°C 
(SSP1-2.6) to 5.3°C (SSP5-8.5) by 2070–2099 compared to 1981–2010 (Almazroui et al., 2020a). The 
projected warming is the highest in the north, reaching 5.9°C and lowest in the south (4.7°C). COSMO-CLM 
projections over the CORDEX-MENA domain show for ARP and WCA a strong warming with marked 
seasonality for the end of the 21st century, ranging from 2.5°C in winter under RCP4.5 to 8°C in summer 
under RCP8.5 and with large increases found over high-altitude areas in winter and spring (Bucchignani et 
al., 2018; Ozturk et al., 2018). The CMIP5 multi-model mean warming in boreal summer in 2070–2099, 
compared with 1951–1980, is projected to be about 2.5°C and 6.5°C at the 2°C and 4°C global warming 
levels respectively (Huang et al., 2014).  

Future projections of precipitation in Southwest Asia have large uncertainties and thus low confidence. There 
are few significant changes, little consensus on the sign and with a tendency for reduction in CMIP5 being 
reversed in CMIP6 across all warming levels (Ozturk et al., 2018). Statistical downscaling of 18 CMIP5 
GCMs under RCP4.5 projected an increase in precipitation of 4.6 mm per decade in Southwest Asia during 
2021–2060 relative to 1965–2004 (Luo et al., 2019). CMIP5 simulations project a general decrease in 
precipitation over lowlands in Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan (Ozturk et al., 2017) and increase over 
high-mountain regions (Aalto et al., 2017; Salman et al., 2018). At a 4°C global warming level, the multi-
model mean annual precipitation for Turkmenistan and parts of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan is projected to 
decrease by 20%, with somewhat stronger relative decreases in summer (Reyer et al., 2017). Over northern 
WCA, the CMIP5 ensemble mean projects increases of over 3 mm per decade under RCP2.6 and over 6 mm 
per decade under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 over the 21st century (Huang et al., 2014). Mean annual precipitation 
is projected to rise by 5.2% at the end of the 21st century (2070–2099) under RCP8.5, compared to 1976–
2005, while mean annual snowfall is projected to decrease by 26.5% in Central Asia (Yang et al., 2017). 
However, regardless of the sign of the precipitation change in the high-mountain regions of Central Asia, the 
influence of the warming on the snowpack will very likely cause important changes in the timing and amount 
of the spring melt (Diffenbaugh et al., 2013). 
 
In ARP, the projected change in ensemble mean annual precipitation from 30 CMIP6 models ranges from 
3.8% (–2.6% to 28.8%) to 31.8% (12.0% to 106.5%) under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 emissions for the period 
2080–2100 compared with 1995–2014 (Almazroui et al., 2020a). Northwest ARP precipitation is projected 
to decrease between –6% to –27% per decade and in the south precipitation to increase by up to 8.6% per 
decade. CMIP6 projections are in line with those from CMIP3 and CMIP5, however they are less variable in 
the central area in CMIP6. The uncertainty associated with precipitation over ARP is large because of very 
low annual amounts and high variability.  
 
 
### Atlas.5.5.5  Summary 
 
Increase in annual surface air temperature over Southwest Asia are very likely in the range of 0.24°C to 
0.81°C per decade over the last 50–60 years. Annual precipitation change over ARP since 1970 is estimated 
at –6.3 mm per decade (and in the range of –30 to 16 mm per decade) and over WCA is generally not 
significant except over the elevated part of eastern WCA where increases between 1.3 mm and 4.8 mm per 
decade during 1960–2013 have been observed (very high confidence). In mountainous areas, the scarcity and 
decline of the number of observation sites since the end of the former Soviet Union from 1991 increase the 
uncertainty of the long-term temperature and precipitation estimates (high confidence).  
 
Mean temperature biases in RCMs are within ±3°C in Southwest Asia, and annual precipitation biases are 
positive in almost all parts of the region except over the ARP where they are negative in the wet season 
(November to April) and over WCA in winter and spring (from December to May) (medium confidence). 
Since regional model evaluation literature has only recently emerged there is medium evidence about the 
performance of RCMs in Southwest Asia though with medium to high agreement on mean temperature and 
precipitation biases. RCMs simulate colder temperatures than observed over mountainous and high plateau 
regions (limited evidence, high agreement).  
 
Further warming over Southwest Asia is projected in the 21st century to be greater than the global average, 
with rates varying from 0.25°C to 0.8°C per decade depending on the season and scenario and maximum 
rates found in the northern part of the region in summer (high confidence). The influence of the warming on 
the snowpack will very likely cause changes in the timing and amount of the spring melt. CMIP6 projected 
changes in annual precipitation totals are in the range of –3% to 29% (SSP1-2.6) and 12% to 107% (SSP5-
8.5) in ARP (medium confidence). Strong spatio-temporal differences with overall precipitation decreases 
projected in the central and northern parts of WCA in summer (JJA) with increases in winter (DJF) (medium 
confidence). 

# Atlas.6  Australasia 
 
The assessment in this section focuses on changes in average temperature and precipitation (rainfall and 
snow), including the most recent years of observations, updates to observed datasets, the consideration of 
recent studies using CMIP5 and those using CMIP6 and CORDEX simulations. Assessment of changes in 
extremes are in Chapter 11 (Table 11.10–12) and climatic impact-drivers in Chapter 12 (Table 12.5). 
 
## Atlas.6.1  Key features of the regional climate and findings from previous IPCC assessments 
 
### Atlas.6.1.1  Key features of the regional climate 
 
Australasia is divided into five regions for the Atlas (Figure Atlas.21), as follows: New Zealand (NZ), with a 
varied climate with diverse landscapes, mainly maritime temperate with four distinct seasons; Northern 
Australia (NAU) which is mainly tropical with monsoonal summer-dominated rainfall (monsoon season 
December to March, see Annex V), but with a hot, semi-arid climate in the south of the region; Central 
Australia (CAU) with a predominantly hot, dry desert climate; Eastern Australia (EAU) with a temperate 
oceanic climate at the coast to semi-arid inland; and Southern Australia (SAU) which ranges from 
Mediterranean and semi-arid in the west to mainly cool temperate maritime climate in the southeast. Various 
remote drivers have notable teleconnections to regions within Australasia, including an effect of the El Niño 
Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole (Table Atlas.1, Annex IV). Much of southern NZ and 
SAU are affected by systems within the westerly mid-latitude circulation, in turn affected by the Southern 
Annular Mode. The monsoon and the Madden-Julian Oscillation affect rainfall variability in northern 
Australia.  
 
 
### Atlas.6.1.2  Findings from previous IPCC assessments 
 
The AR5 WGI and WGII reports (IPCC, 2013c; Stocker et al., 2013; Reisinger et al., 2014) give very high 
confidence that air and sea temperatures in the region have warmed, cool extremes have become rarer in 
Australia and New Zealand since 1950, while hot extremes have become more frequent and intense (e.g., it 
is very likely that the number of warm days and nights have increased). The AR5 reported it is virtually 
certain that mean air and sea temperatures will continue to increase, with very high confidence that the 
greatest increase will be experienced by inland Australia and the smallest increase by coastal areas and New 
Zealand. The AR5 reported a range of different precipitation trends within the region. For example, while 
annual rainfall has been significantly increasing in north-western Australia since the 1950s (very high 
confidence), it has been decreasing in the northeast of the South Island of New Zealand over 1950–2004 
(very high confidence) and over southwest of Western Australia. In line with these trends, WGI reported it is 
likely that drought has decreased in northwest Australia. Future projections for precipitation extremes 
indicate an increase in most of Australia and New Zealand, in terms of rare daily rainfall extremes (i.e., 
current 20-year return period events) and of short duration (sub-daily) extremes (medium confidence). 
Likewise, however, there is a projected increase the frequency of drought in southern Australia (medium 
confidence) and in many parts of New Zealand (medium confidence). Owing to hotter and drier conditions 
there is high confidence that the occurrence of fire weather will increase in most of southern Australia, and 
medium confidence that the fire danger index will increase in many parts of New Zealand. 
 
AR5 reported mean sea levels have also increased in Australia and New Zealand at average rates of relative 
sea-level rise of 1.4 ± 0.6 mm yr–1 from 1900 to 2011, and 1.7 ± 0.1 mm yr–1 from 1900 to 2009, respectively 
(very high confidence). The assessment found that the volume of ice in New Zealand has declined by 36–
61% from the mid-late 1800s to the late 1900s (high confidence), while late-season significant snow depth 
has also declined in three out of four Snowy Mountain sites in Australia between 1957 and 2002 (high 
confidence). As mean sea-level rise is projected to continue for at least several more centuries, there is very 
high confidence that this will lead to large increases in the frequency of extreme sea-level events in Australia 
and New Zealand. On the other hand, the volume of winter snow and the number of days with low-elevation 
snow cover in New Zealand are projected to decrease in the future (very high confidence), while both snow 
depth and area are projected to decline in Australia (very high confidence). 
 
SROCC (Hock et al., 2019b) reports on the observed and projected decline in snow cover in Australasia, as 
well as the retreat of New Zealand glaciers following an advance in 1983–2008 due to enhanced snowfall. It 
also reports on the vulnerability of some Australian communities and ecosystems to sea level rise, increases 
in the intensity and duration of marine heatwaves driven by human influence (high confidence), the decrease 
in frequency of tropical cyclones landfall on eastern Australia since the late 1800s (low confidence in an 
anthropogenic signal), and presented a case study on the multiple hazards, compound risk and cascading 
impacts from climate extremes in Tasmania in 2015/2016 (including an attributable human influence on 
some events). SRCCL (Mirzabaev et al., 2019) found widespread vegetation ‘greening’ has occurred in parts 
of Australia, and an increase in the desertification and drought risk in future in southern Australia. 
 
 
## Atlas.6.2  Assessment and synthesis of observations, trends and attribution 
 
Reliable station observations are available from around 1900 in Australasia, but in some regions the 
coverage was and remains poor. Australia and New Zealand have continued to warm, and many rainfall 
trends have continued since the AR5. Changes and trends in temperature and precipitation from 1961 to 
2015 from three different global data sets are displayed in Figure Atlas.11 and the Interactive Atlas and show 
significant (at 0.1 significance level) warming trends over the southern and eastern Australia. Most of the 
observed changes in precipitation over the region are not significant over this period. Although observed 
datasets (e.g. GPCC and GPCP) generally agree on a significant drying trend in the southern regions of New 
Zealand during the shorter 1980 to 2015 period, this is in fact the reverse of the longer-term trends in 1961 to 
2015 (Interactive Atlas). 
 
For a longer-term perspective based on high-quality regional datasets, Figure Atlas.20 shows Australasia has 
warmed over the last century (very high confidence). Australian mean temperature has increased by 1.44 ± 
0.24°C during the period 1910–2019 using the updated observed temperature dataset ACORN-SATv2.1, 
with 2019 Australia’s hottest year on record and nine out of ten warmest years on record occurring since 
2005 (Trewin et al., 2020). Much of the warming has occurred since 1960, there is clear anthropogenic 
attribution of this change and emergence of the signal from the1850-1900 climate (BOM and CSIRO, 2020; 
Hawkins et al., 2020).Warming has been more rapid than the national average in central and eastern 
Australia, with a warming minimum and non-significant trends since the 1960s in the northwest (CSIRO and 
BOM, 2015; BOM and CSIRO, 2020). The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research 
temperature record, NIWA NZ, shows a warming of 1.13 ± 0.27°C during the period 1909–2019, although 
several stations show non-significant trends since 1960 (Figure Atlas.20), including a warming minimum in 
the southeast at least partly due to a persistent shift in atmospheric circulation (Sturman and Quénol, 2013; 
MfE and Stats NZ, 2017, 2020). 
 
<figref>ATLAS.20</figref> 

Since 1960, precipitation has increased in much of mainland Australia in austral summer and decreased in 
many regions of southern and eastern Australia in austral winter (Figure Atlas.20). A detectable 
anthropogenic signal of increases in precipitation in Australia has been reported particularly for north central 
Australia and for a few regions along the south-central coast for the period 1901–2010 (Knutson and Zeng, 
2018). Seasonally, there is a significant decline in winter rainfall in southwest Western Australia (Figure 
Atlas.20), with an attributable human influence with high confidence (robust evidence and medium 
agreement) (Delworth and Zeng, 2014, and others)(see Section 10.4). Rainfall trends in the southeast are not 
significant since 1960 but have shown a notable reduction since the 1990s, and there is limited evidence for 
the attribution of this change to human influence (e.g., Rauniyar and Power, 2020). In New Zealand between 
1960 and 2019 in both summer and winter, rainfall increased in some stations in the South Island and 
decreased at many stations in the North Island, however most station trends are not statistically significant 
(Figure Atlas.20)(MfE and Stats NZ, 2020). In JJA, Milford Sound (increasing) and Whangaparaoa 
(decreasing) trends are significant.  
 
In Australia, there has been a decrease in snow depth and area since the late 1950s, especially in spring 
(BOM and CSIRO, 2018). Based on a reconstructed snow cover record, the recent rapid decrease in the past 
five decades has been shown to be larger by more than an order of magnitude than the maximum loss for any 
5-decade period over the past 2000 years (McGowan et al., 2018). In New Zealand, from 1977 to 2018, 
glacier ice volume decreased from 26.6 km3 to 17.9 km3 (a loss of 33%) (Salinger et al., 2019).  
 
 
## Atlas.6.3  Assessment of climate model performance 
 
Most studies assessed in WGII AR5 were based on Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 3 
(CMIP3) models and Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) scenarios and CMIP5 models whenever 
available. WGI AR5 reported that model biases in annual temperature and rainfall are similar to or lower 
than other continental regions outside the tropics, with temperature biases generally <1°C in the multi-model 
mean and <2°C in most models over Australia compared to reanalysis, and with a wet bias over the 
Australian inland region but a dry bias near coasts and mountain regions of both Australia and New Zealand.  
 
Early results from CMIP6 suggest incremental improvements compared to CMIP5 in the simulation of the 
mean annual climatology of temperature and precipitation of the Indo-Pacific region surrounding 
Australasia, the teleconnection between ENSO and IOD and Australian rainfall and other relevant climate 
features (Grose et al., 2020). These assessments suggest that confidence in projections is similar to AR5 or 
incrementally improved. The CORDEX Australasia simulations are found to have cold biases in daily 
maximum temperature and an overestimation of precipitation but overall showed added value in the 
simulation of the current climate (Di Virgilio et al., 2019; Evans et al., 2020b).  
 
 
## Atlas.6.4  Assessment and synthesis of projections 
 
Similar to the global average (Chapter 4), mean temperature in Australasia is projected to continue to rise 
through the 21st century at a magnitude proportional to the cumulative greenhouse-gas emissions (virtually 
certain, very high confidence, robust evidence), CMIP5 and CMIP6 results are shown in Figure Atlas.21. A 
higher end to the range of temperature projections is found in CMIP6 compared to CMIP5 (Grose et al., 
2020), produced by a group of models with high climate sensitivity (Forster et al., 2019), and this creates a 
higher multi-model-mean change. For example, projections for Australasia including ocean between 1995–
2014 and 2081–2100 are 1.4°C (1.1°C to 1.8°C 10th–90th percentile range) in CMIP5 under RCP4.5, but 
1.8°C (1.3°C to 2.5°C) in CMIP6 under SSP2-4.5. 
 
Using warming levels, the results can be directly compared accounting for the different distribution of 
climate sensitivities in the two ensembles. In this framework, Australasia (land only) is projected to warm by 
a similar amount to the global average: 1.4°C to 1.8°C for the 1.5°C warming level, through to 3.9°C to 
4.8°C for the 4°C warming level from the 1850–1900 baseline in CMIP6 using SSP5-8.5 (results using other 
SSPs and from CMIP5 are similar). Projected warming is greater over land than ocean, greater in Australia 
than in New Zealand, and greater over inland Australia than coastal regions. Due to historical warming, 
projected temperature change from the AR6 baseline of 1995–2014 is lower: 0.3°C to 1.0°C for the 1.5°C 
warming level, through to 2.9°C to 4.0°C for the 4°C warming level. Changes for other warming levels, 
subregions and emissions pathways are shown in Figure Atlas.21 and can be explored in the Interactive 
Atlas. Regional modelling suggests projected temperature increase is higher in mountainous areas than 
surrounding low-elevation areas in New Zealand and Australia (Olson et al., 2016; MfE, 2018). 
 
<figref>ATLAS.21</figref> 
 
In line with recent trends, a significant reduction in annual mean rainfall in southwest Australia is projected, 
with the greatest reduction in winter and spring (very likely, high confidence). There is more than 80% model 
agreement for projected mean annual rainfall decrease in southwest Western Australia for both mid (2041–
2060) and far (2081–2100) future, and for all warming levels (Interactive Atlas). Rainfall decreases, mainly 
in winter and spring, are also projected for other regions within southern Australia with only medium 
confidence (medium evidence and medium agreement). Almost all models project continued drying in SAU 
in winter (JJA) and also in spring (SON), but a few models show little change. CMIP5 and CMIP6 results 
are similar or with a slightly narrower range in the latter (Figure Atlas.21). CORDEX produces a similar 
range of change in winter rainfall change for SAU as a whole. Circulation change is the dominant driver of 
these projected reductions, explaining the range of model results for southern Australia (CSIRO and BOM, 
2015; Mindlin et al., 2020). Studies of winter rainfall change and circulation in southern Australia suggest 
the wettest changes in winter rainfall change may possibly be rejected (Grose et al., 2017, 2019a).  
 
The model mean projection of northern Australian wet season precipitation (a period including DJF) is for 
little change under all SSPs and warming levels, with low confidence in the direction of change as the 
projections include both large and significant decrease and increases (Figure Atlas.21, Interactive Atlas). 
Evidence from warming patterns suggests a constraint on the dry end of projections (Brown et al., 2016), and 
the CMIP6 ensemble suggests that the projection follows the zonally-averaged rainfall response in the 
southern hemisphere rather than changes in the western Pacific (Narsey et al., 2020). There is also evidence 
for a projected increase in rainfall variability in northern Australia in scales from days to decades (Brown et 
al., 2017). Liu et al. (2018) find that under 1.5°C warming, central and northeast Australia is projected to 
become wetter, however this projection has low confidence. There are similar projections from CMIP5 and 
CMIP6 (Figure Atlas.21). 

Projections for EAU vary by season, with moderate model agreement on a decrease in rainfall in winter and 
spring, but with lower agreement in CMIP6 compared to CMIP5, and low model agreement on the direction 
of change in summer (Figure Atlas.21). CAU shows a similar range of change as EAU, with low model 
agreement on the direction of change in DJF, moderate agreement on direction of change in JJA, but 
significant changes are projected by some models. Other seasonal and regional rainfall changes in Australia 
are reviewed in Dey et al. (2019). 
 
For the NZ reference region, precipitation is projected to increase in winter and annual rainfall, with some 
differences in magnitude between CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX (Figure Atlas.21). This projection of 
rainfall increase is a function of changes in the southern extent of the region, and notable regional differences 
are expected. Regional modelling suggests precipitation increases in the west and south of New Zealand and 
decreases in the north and east (MfE, 2018), with medium confidence, and with notable differences by 
season. Liu et al. (2018) project that the North Island will be drier, while the South Island will be wetter 
under both 1.5°C and 2°C warming levels. The projected increase in precipitation in the far future (2081–
2100) for the southern regions of NZ has high agreement (Interactive Atlas). Other seasonal and regional 
rainfall changes in Australia can be explored in the Interactive Atlas. 
 
The CORDEX Australasia simulations produce some regional detail in projected precipitation change 
associated with important features such as orography. Areas where there is coincident ‘added value’ in the 
simulation of the current climate and ‘potential added value’ as new information in the projected climate 
change signal (collectively termed ‘realised added value’) in Australia include the Australian Alps, Tasmania 
and parts of northern Australia (Di Virgilio et al., 2020). There have been several studies of regional climate 
change for New Zealand and states within Australia at fine resolution (5–12 km) that have produced 
important insights. One is enhanced drying in cool seasons on the windward slopes of the southern 
Australian Alps (decreases of 20–30% compared to 10–15% in the driving models), and conversely a chance 
of enhanced rainfall increase on the peaks of mountains in summer (Grose et al., 2019b), with the summer 
finding in line with those for the European Alps (Giorgi et al., 2016).  
 
Under future warming, the snowpack in Australia is projected to decrease by approximately 15% and 60% 
by 2030 and 2070 respectively under the SRES A2 scenario (Di Luca et al., 2018), while in New Zealand the 
number of annual snow days is projected to decrease by 30 days or more by 2090 under RCP8.5 (MfE, 
2018). New Zealand is also projected to lose up to 88 ± 5% of its glacier volume by the end of the 21st 
century (Chinn et al., 2012; Hock et al., 2019a).  
 
 
## Atlas.6.5  Summary 
 
There is very high confidence that the climate of Australia warmed by around 1.4°C and New Zealand by 
around 1.1°C since reliable records began in 1910 and 1909 respectively, with human influence the dominant 
driver. Warming is virtually certain to continue, with a magnitude roughly equal to the global average 
temperature. A significant decrease in April to October rainfall in southwest Western Australia is observed 
from 1910 to 2019, is attributable to human influence with high confidence and is very likely to continue in 
future noting consistent projections in CMIP5 and CMIP6. Other observed and projected rainfall trends are 
less significant or less certain. Model representation of the climatology of Australasian temperature and 
rainfall has improved since AR5, through an incremental improvement between CMIP5 and CMIP6 and the 
development of coordinated regional modelling through CORDEX-Australasia. Snow cover is likely to 
decrease throughout the region at high altitudes in both Australia and New Zealand (high confidence). 
 
 
# Atlas.7  Central and South America 
 
The assessment in this section focuses on changes in average surface temperature and precipitation (rainfall 
and snow), including the most recent years of observations, updates to observed datasets, the consideration 
of recent studies using CMIP5 and those using CMIP6 and CORDEX simulations. Assessment of changes in 
extremes are in Chapter 11 (Table 11.13–15) and climatic impact-drivers in Chapter 12 (Table 12.6). It 
considers climate change over the regions show in Figure Atlas.22, extending to all territories from Mexico 
to South America, including the Caribbean islands. This figure supports the assessment of regional mean 
changes over the region which, due to the high climatological and geographical heterogeneity, has been split 
into two subregions: Central America and the Caribbean, and South America.  
 
<figref>ATLAS.22</figref> 

 
## Atlas.7.1  Central America and the Caribbean 
 
### Atlas.7.1.1  Key features of the regional climate and findings from previous IPCC assessments 
 
#### Atlas.7.1.1.1  Key features of the regional climate 
The Central America and Caribbean region is assessed considering three reference regions South Central 
America (SCA), including the isthmus and the Yucatan peninsula; North Central America (NCA), including 
Mexico (centre and north); and the Caribbean (CAR), including the Greater Antilles, the Lesser Antilles, the 
Bahamas and other small islands (see Figure Atlas.22); NCA is also covered in Section Atlas.9 North 
America. 
 
Precipitation in most of SCA is characterized by two maxima in June and September, an extended dry season 
from November to May, and a shorter relatively dry season between July and August known as the 
midsummer drought (MSD) (Magaña et al., 1999; Perdigón-Morales et al., 2018) (see Chapter 10). To some 
extent, precipitation seasonality is explained by the migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) 
(Taylor and Alfaro, 2005). The climate of NCA is temperate to the north of the Tropic of Cancer, with 
marked difference between winter and summer, modulated by the North American monsoon (NAmerM, 
Section 8.3.2.4.4). CAR has two main seasons, characterized by differences in temperature and precipitation. 
The wet or rainy season, with higher values of temperature and accumulated precipitation, occurs during the 
boreal summer and part of spring and autumn (Gouirand et al., 2020). The MSD is also present in the Greater 
Antilles and the Bahamas (Taylor and Alfaro, 2005), influenced by the oscillations of the North Atlantic 
Subtropical High (NASH), interacting with the Pacific and Atlantic branches of the ITCZ and modulated by 
the Atlantic Warm Pool and the Caribbean Low-Level Jet (CLLJ), while the Atlantic ITCZ is responsible for 
the unimodal rainfall cycle of the central and southern Lesser Antilles (Martinez et al., 2019). The CLLJ is a 
persistent climatological feature of the low-level circulation in the Central Caribbean, with a characteristic 
semi-annual cycle with maxima in the summer (main) and winter (secondary) (Amador, 1998; Magaña et al., 
1999; Whyte et al., 2008). Temporal variability is influenced by several large-scale atmospheric modes (see 
Annex IV and Table Atlas.1). A significant positive correlation between precipitation rates in CAR and the 
Atlantic Multidecadal Variability was found (Enfield et al., 2001). A similar result was found in southern 
Mexico (north of SCA) in the MSD region (Méndez and Magaña, 2010; Cavazos et al., 2020) (see case-
study discussion in Section 10.4.2.3). On the other hand, ENSO favours wet conditions in NCA, but its effect 
is modulated by Pacific Decadal Variability (Maldonado et al., 2016). 
 
One of the most prominent features of the regional climate is the incidence of tropical cyclones (TCs), which 
represent an important hazard for almost all the countries of the region between June and November. A 
detailed assessment is given in Chapter 11. 
 
 
#### Atlas.7.1.1.2  Findings from previous IPCC assessments 
According to the AR5 (Christensen et al., 2013), significant positive trends of temperature have been 
observed in Central America (high confidence), while significant precipitation trends are regionally 
dependent, especially during the summer. In addition, changes in climate variability and in extreme events 
have severely affected the region (medium confidence). A decrease in mean precipitation is projected in SCA 
and NCA. El Niño and La Niña teleconnections are projected to move eastwards in the future (medium 
confidence), while changes in their effects on other regions, including Central America and the Caribbean is 
uncertain (medium confidence). There is medium confidence in projections showing an increase in seasonal 
mean precipitation on the equatorial flank of the ITCZ affecting parts of Central America and the Caribbean. 
 
In relation to the 1986–2005 baseline period, temperatures are very likely to increase by the end of the 
century, even for the RCP2.6 scenario, with changes of more than 5°C in some regions for the RCP8.5 
scenario. Precipitation change is projected to vary between +10% and –25% (medium confidence) 
(Christensen et al., 2013). SR1.5 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018) states there is a high agreement and robust 
evidence that at the 1.5°C global warming level the Caribbean region will experience a 0.5°C to 1.5°C 
warming compared to the 1971–2000 baseline period, with greatest warming over larger land masses.  
 
 
### Atlas.7.1.2  Assessment and synthesis of observations, trends and attribution 
 
Significant warming trends between 0.2°C and 0.3°C per decade have been observed in the three reference 
regions of Central America in the last 30 years (Planos Gutiérrez et al., 2012; Jones et al., 2016c; Hidalgo et 
al., 2017), with the largest increases in the North America monsoon region (high confidence) (Cavazos et al., 
2020) (see also Figure Atlas.11 and the Interactive Atlas). There is high confidence of increasing temperature 
over parts of NCA, reaching 0.5°C per decade in Mexico and southern Baja California. with a lower rate 
(0.2°C per decade) in the Yucatan Peninsula and the Guatemala Pacific coastal region (Cueto et al., 2010; 
García Cueto et al., 2013; Martínez-Austria et al., 2016; Martínez-Austria and Bandala, 2017; Navarro-
Estupiñan et al., 2018; Cavazos et al., 2020) and CAR (McLean et al., 2015) over the last 30 to 40 years. 
Cooling trends have been detected in limited areas of Honduras and northern Panama (Hidalgo et al., 2017).  
 
Changes in mean precipitation rates are less consistent and long-term trends are generally weak. Different 
databases show significant differences depending mainly on the type and resolution of data (Centella-Artola 
et al., 2020). Small positive trends were observed in the total annual precipitation (Stephenson et al., 2014). 
In SCA and CAR, trends in annual precipitation are generally non-significant, with the exception of small 
significant positive trends for subregions or limited periods (Planos Gutiérrez et al., 2012; Hidalgo et al., 
2017) and the 1970–1999 trends in precipitation in SCA are generally non-significant (Jones et al., 2016a; 
Hidalgo et al., 2017). Positive trends in the duration of the MSD have been found in this region over the past 
four decades (Anderson et al., 2019) (low confidence). For CAR see also Section Atlas.10 Small Islands. 
 
 
### Atlas.7.1.3  Assessment of model performance 
 
The ability of climate models to simulate the climate in this region has improved in many key aspects 
(Karmalkar et al., 2013; Fuentes-Franco et al., 2014, 2015, 2017; Vichot-Llano et al., 2014; Vichot-Llano 
and Martínez-Castro, 2017; Martínez-Castro et al., 2018a). Particularly relevant for this region are increased 
model resolution and a better representation of the land-surface processes (high confidence). 
 
Regional climate models (RCMs) forced with reanalyses and atmosphere-only global climate models provide 
simulations with a reasonably good performance over the core North American monsoon, mostly in NCA 
(high confidence) (Bukovsky et al., 2013; Cerezo-Mota et al., 2015). RCMs also reproduce the seasonal 
spatial patterns of temperature and the bimodal rainfall characteristics of the NCA, SCA and CAR (high 
confidence) (Karmalkar et al., 2013; Centella-Artola et al., 2015; Martínez-Castro et al., 2018b; Cavazos et 
al., 2020; Vichot-Llano et al., 2020) though in some subregions specific models overestimate and shift the 
month of the maxima. RCM simulations in the region do not necessarily improve with the size of the 
domain, as important features of the regional circulation and key rainfall climate features, such as the CLLJ 
and MSD, are well represented for a variety of domains of different sizes (Centella-Artola et al., 2015; Cabos 
et al., 2018; Martínez-Castro et al., 2018b; Cavazos et al., 2020; Vichot-Llano et al., 2020) (high 
confidence).  
 
 
### Atlas.7.1.4  Assessment and synthesis of projections 
 
Figure Atlas.22 and the Interactive Atlas synthesize regional mean changes in annual mean surface air 
temperature and precipitation for the Central America reference regions for CMIP6, CMIP5 and CORDEX 
for different warming levels and time periods. At the 1.5°C GWL, it is very likely that average annual 
temperature in Central America over land surpasses 1.3°C (CAR), 1.7°C (NCA) and 1.6°C (SCA). For the 
3°C GWL, the corresponding projected ensemble mean regional warming values are 2.7°C (CAR), 3.5°C 
(NCA) and 3.1°C (SCA). CAR average annual warming is below the level of global warming, while the two 
continental reference regions are close to the global warming level with CMIP6 and CMIP5 showing very 
consistent results (Figure Atlas.22). However, when focusing in time slices instead of warming levels, the 
CMIP6 projections show systematically higher median values than CMIP5. CORDEX results are also 
consistent with the previous findings, though the subset of driving models spans a smaller range of 
uncertainty, particularly over CAR. Results have also been reported for this region based on CMIP5, CMIP6 
and downscaled simulations over the CORDEX CAM domain or similar smaller domains (Taylor et al., 
2013a; Nakaegawa et al., 2014; Imbach et al., 2018; Vichot-Llano et al., 2019; Almazroui et al., 2021). 
Statistical downscaling methods have been also applied to CMIP5 projections to obtain bias-adjusted 
regional projections (Colorado-Ruiz et al., 2018; Taylor et al., 2018; Vichot-Llano et al., 2019).  
 
Global and regional models consistently project warming in the whole region for the end of the century, 
under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 for CMIP5 projections with greater warming for continental compared to insular 
territories, likely reaching values between 2°C and 4°C (high confidence) (Campbell et al., 2011; Karmalkar 
et al., 2011; Cavazos and Arriaga-Ramírez, 2012; Cantet et al., 2014; Chou et al., 2014; Coppola et al., 2014; 
Hidalgo et al., 2017; Colorado-Ruiz et al., 2018; Imbach et al., 2018). The greatest warming of 5.8°C for the 
end of the century was projected for northern Mexico under RCP8.5 (Colorado-Ruiz et al., 2018), using an 
ensemble of CMIP5 GCMs (see also the Interactive Atlas).  
 
Regarding precipitation, it is likely that the annual average precipitation changes for the 1.5°C GWL will be 
in the ranges of –11% to 0% in CAR, from –12% to 0% in SCA, and from –10% to +3% in NCA (Interactive 
Atlas). For the 3°C GWL, the corresponding annual average precipitation changes will be from –17% to –2% 
in CAR, from –16% to +2% in NCA, and from –23% to 0% in SCA. A clear drying tendency is observed for 
the 3°C GWL relative to the 1.5°C GWL. Maloney et al. (2014) examined 21st-century climate projections 
of North American climate in CMIP5 models under RCP8.5, including Central America and the Caribbean. 
Summertime drying was projected in CAR and SCA for most of the models, with good agreement. The 
strongest drying is projected to occur during July and August which are the months when the MSD occurs in 
many subregions (Figure Atlas.22 and the Interactive Atlas). Intensification of the MSD in SCA was also 
projected by using the Rossby Centre Regional Climate Model (RCA4) (Corrales-Suastegui et al., 2020), but 
with future decrease in area and frequency (see Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.2). They also found a projected 
intensification of CLLJ and drying for the future time slice of 2071–2095, relative to their baseline of 1981–2005.
Decreased precipitation was also projected for SCA (Imbach et al., 2018) with the 8-km resolution Eta 
RCM during the rainy season, including an intensification of the MSD, although no significant change was 
projected for the CLLJ.  
 
Colorado-Ruiz et al. (2018) assessed an ensemble of 14 GCMs from CMIP5 for a 1971–2000 baseline 
period, projecting precipitation decreases of between 5% and 10% by the end of the century for the RCP4.5 
and RCP8.5 scenarios respectively. The greatest decrease in precipitation is projected during summer 
reaching 13%, especially in southern Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. Dynamically downscaled 
simulations (Bukovsky et al., 2015) also projected a decrease of precipitation for the middle of the century 
(2041–2069) relative to 1971–1999 for the north of Mexico, though despite good agreement amongst the 
models, these results must be considered of low confidence, because of their poor simulation of important 
monsoon physical processes. Vichot-Llano et al. (2021) used a multiparameter ensemble of RegCM4, driven 
by the CMIP5 global model HagGEM2-ES projections to conclude that, relative to the 1975–2004 baseline, 
in the near (2020–2049) and more prominently in the far (2070–2099) future, drier conditions will prevail at 
over the eastern Caribbean. The projected future warming trend was statistically significant at the 95% 
confidence level over CAR and SCA. Almazroui et al. (2021) used an ensemble of 31 CMIP6 models to 
estimate climate change signals of temperature and precipitation in six reference regions in North, Central 
America and the Caribbean, finding a decrease in precipitation (10–30 %) over Central America and the 
Caribbean under three scenarios with regional and seasonal variations. 
 
There is high agreement and high confidence in the projected decrease of precipitation by the end of the 
century for most of the region particularly for annual and summer precipitation, but there is low confidence 
on the magnitude of this decrease which varies between 5% and 50% for different projections and different 
subregions (see extended information in the Interactive Atlas). 
 
The status of climate extreme trends and projections for the region has been assessed in Chapter 11 and the 
main findings are synthesized here. There is high confidence in the projections of significant heatwave 
events at the end of the century in SCA (Angeles-Malaspina et al., 2018) and an increase in warm days and 
warm nights over this region and CAR (Stennett-Brown et al., 2017). For CAR islands, using dynamically 
downscaled CMIP3 models, Karmalkar et al. (2013) projected increase in drought severity at the end of the 
century, mainly due to precipitation decrease during the early wet season. In SCA projections suggest an 
increase in the MSD (Imbach et al., 2018) and increase in consecutive dry days (Chou et al., 2014), 
consistent with the projections of Stennett-Brown et al. (2017). 
 
 
### Atlas.7.1.5  Summary 
 
Significant warming trends between 0.2°C and 0.3°C per decade have been observed in the three reference 
regions of Central America in the last 30 years, with the largest increases in the North America monsoon 
region (high confidence). Changes in mean precipitation rates are less consistent and long-term trends are 
generally weak. Small positive trends were observed in the total annual precipitation in part of the region. 
 
Warming in the continental part of the region is projected to increase in the range of the mean global values 
for GWL of 1.5°C and 3°C, but in the Caribbean regional warming will be lower. Precipitation is projected 
to decrease with increasing GWLs especially for CAR and SCA. 
 
Projected change in mean annual precipitation shows a large spatial variability across Central America and 
the Caribbean. Under moderate future emissions overall negative but non-significant precipitation trends are 
projected for the 21st century (low confidence). Under higher emissions scenarios and at higher GWLs, 
average precipitation is likely to decrease in most of the region, particularly in the north-western and central 
Caribbean and part of continental Central America, especially in SCA. 

## Atlas.7.2  South America 
 
### Atlas.7.2.1  Key features of the regional climate and findings from previous IPCC assessments 
 
#### Atlas.7.2.1.1  Key features of the regional climate 
Regional synthesis of observed and modelled climate in South America is challenging due to the latitudinal 
extent of the continent, the Andes mountains, and local to regional climatic features, which are influenced by 
multiple drivers. The main large-scale drivers include many modes of natural variability (Annex IV.2): the 
interdecadal modes, Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV) and Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV); the 
interannual-to-annual modes, El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), the 
Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO); seasonal variability driven by the 
meridional migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and the timing and intensity of the South 
American Monsoon System (SAmerM, Section 8.3.2.4.5), the Madden-Julian Oscillation sub-seasonal mode 
of natural variability (MJO) and the behaviour at finer scales of the tropical easterly waves.  
 
The regional assessment in this section emphasizes the seven new South American reference regions (Figure 
Atlas.22) (Iturbide et al., 2020) that have a largely consistent climate and response to climate change and can 
be used for analysis and impact studies (Solman et al., 2008; Neukom et al., 2010; Barros et al., 2015; Nobre 
et al., 2016). At the subregional scale, several phenomena drive climate variability. Brazil's northeast (North-
Eastern South America; NES) is the most densely populated dryland globally and recurrently affected by 
climatic extremes. The climate variability, particularly the precipitation, is marked by strong interannual 
variability related to ENSO, the ITCZ, and the North Tropical Atlantic Ocean SSTs (Marengo et al., 2018a). 
Northern (NSA) and North-Western South America (NWS) are part of the Amazonia region. Its most 
recognizable features are the high rainfall, high humidity, and high temperatures that prevail in the region. 
Rainfall variability in these regions results from the interplay between regional atmospheric circulation, the 
SSTs variations in both the Pacific and Atlantic ocean, among other regional-to-local interactions (Marengo 
and Espinoza, 2016; Espinoza et al., 2020). The South America monsoon (SAM) region has distinct wet 
(summer) and dry (winter) periods. Key drivers include the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (Marengo et 
al., 2012), the Bolivian High the 40- to 60-day intraseasonal oscillation, and the forcing of the high Andes 
Mountains to the west (Almeida et al., 2017). The geographic position of South-Western South America 
(SWS) results in very specific climatic characteristics since SWS contains subtropical climates as well as 
sub-Antarctic and Antarctic climates. The climate of SWS is driven by seasonal changes in the position of 
subtropical high-pressure air masses in the South Atlantic and South Pacific ocean, the Southern Annular 
Mode, the dynamics of the cold Humboldt ocean current, and the icy cold fronts and mid-latitude westerlies 
(Valdés-Pineda et al., 2016). The densely populated, highly productive subregion of South-Eastern South 
America (SES) has cool winters and hot summers typical of the temperate zone, and climatic conditions are 
strongly tied to ENSO, whose influence is moderated by local air-sea thermodynamics in the South Atlantic 
(Barreiro, 2010). Lastly, the climate of the southern tip of South America (SSA) is cold and dry, and is 
influenced by the Southern Annular Mode, and the interaction between the wetter Pacific winds and the 
Andean Cordillera (Aceituno, 1988; Silvestri and Vera, 2009). 
 
 
#### Atlas.7.2.1.2  Findings from previous IPCC assessments 
According to WGII AR5 Chapter 27 (Magrin et al., 2014), during the last decades of the 20th century, 
observational studies identified significant trends in precipitation and temperature in South America (high 
confidence). Increasing trends in annual rainfall in south-eastern South America contrast with decreasing 
trends in central southern Chile and some regions of Brazil. Warming has been detected throughout South 
America (near 0.7°C to 1°C in the 40 years since the mid-1970s), except for a cooling off the Chilean coast 
of about –1°C over the same period. 
 
WGI AR5 (Flato et al., 2013) noted that climate simulations from CMIP3 and CMIP5 models were able to 
represent well the main climatological features, such as seasonal mean and annual cycle (high confidence), 
although some biases remained over the Andes, Amazon basin and for the South America Monsoon. On the 
other hand, climate models from CMIP5 showed better results when compared to CMIP3.  

The SR1.5 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018) assessed that a further increase of 0.5°C or 1°C is likely to have 
detectable effects on mean temperature and precipitation in South America, particularly in tropical regions 
(NWS, NAS, SAM and NES), as well as in SES given that changes in mean temperatures and precipitation 
have already been attributed in the last decades for global warming of less than 1°C.  
 
 
### Atlas.7.2.2  Assessment and synthesis of observations, trends and attribution 
 
Studies on climatic trends in South America indicate that mean temperature and extremely warm maximum 
and minimum temperatures have shown an increasing trend (high confidence), particularly for a large region 
in northern South America and the south-western Andes (NSA, SAM, NES, SWS and the north of SES) 
(Skansi et al., 2013; de Barros Soares et al., 2017). Also, the trend of the difference between the annual mean 
of the daily maximum temperature and the annual mean of the daily minimum temperature was positive – up 
to 1°C per decade – over the extra-tropics with the maximum temperature generally increasing faster than the 
minimum temperature, while a negative trend – up to –0.5°C per decade – was observed over the tropics. 
 
Regionally, analyses of temperatures point to an increased warming trend (high confidence) over Amazonia 
over the last 40 years, which reached approximately 0.6°C–0.7°C (Figure Atlas.11 and the Interactive Atlas) 
and with stronger warming during the dry season and over the southeast. The analyses also showed that 2016 
was the warmest year since at least 1950 (Marengo et al., 2018b). Andean temperatures showed significant 
warming trends, especially at inland and higher-elevation sites, while trends are non-significant or negative 
at coastal sites (Vuille et al., 2015; Burger et al., 2018; Vicente-Serrano et al., 2018; Pabón-Caicedo et al., 
2020) (high confidence). Over central Chile, positive trends are largely restricted to austral spring, summer 
and autumn seasons for mean, maximum and minimum temperatures (Burger et al., 2018; Vicente-Serrano et 
al., 2018). Over Peru trends of maximum air temperature were mainly amplified during the austral summer, 
but trends of cold season minimum air temperature showed an opposite pattern, with the strongest warming 
being recorded in the austral winter (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2018). 
 
In general, the spatial patterns of observed trends in temperature are more consistent than for precipitation 
across the whole South America (Interactive Atlas) (de Barros Soares et al., 2017) (medium confidence). In 
southeast Brazil there is a region of highly significant decrease of rainfall in both wet and dry seasons 
recorded in the period 1979–2011 (Rao et al., 2016) (Interactive Atlas). The most consistent evidence of 
positive rainfall trend occurs in the southern part of the La Plata Basin (southern Brazil, Uruguay, and north-
eastern Argentina) (de Barros Soares et al., 2017) (high confidence). By contrast, there is high confidence 
that annual rainfall has decreased over northeast Brazil during the last decades (Carvalho et al., 2020). 
Contrary to temperature changes, trends in annual precipitation exhibit different signs across sectors in the 
Andes. For instance, annual precipitation trends in north tropical (north of 8°S) and south tropical (8°S–
27°S) Andes do not show a homogeneous pattern. Over the subtropical Andes, central Chile shows a robust 
signal of declining precipitation since 1970 (Pabón-Caicedo et al., 2020) (high confidence).  
 
Observational studies show that the dry-season length over southern Amazonia has increased significantly 
since 1979 (Fu et al., 2013; Alves, 2016) (high confidence). In the Peruvian Amazon-Andes basin, there is no  
trend in mean rainfall during the period 1965–2007 (Lavado Casimiro et al., 2012) though statistically 
significant decreases in total annual rainfall in the central and southern Peruvian Andes from 1966 to 2010 
were found (Heidinger et al., 2018). Despite that, recent analyses of Amazon hydrological and precipitation 
data suggest an intensification of the hydrological cycle over the past few decades (Gloor et al., 2015). In 
general, these changes are attributed mainly to decadal climate fluctuations (high confidence), ENSO, the 
Atlantic SST north-south gradient, feedbacks between fire and land-use change mainly across southern 
south-eastern Amazon and changes in the frequency of organized deep convection (Fernandes et al., 2015a; 
Sánchez et al., 2015; Tan et al., 2015).  
 
Since AR5, there has been limited attribution literature in the South America. Recent publications based on 
observational and modelling evidence assessed that anthropogenic forcing in CMIP5 models explains with 
the overall warming (high confidence) over the entire South American continent, including the increase in 
the frequency of extreme temperature events (Hannart et al., 2015) such as the Argentinian heatwave of 
December 2013 (Chapter 11). It has a detectable influence in explaining positive and negative precipitation 
trends observed in regions such as SES and the Southern Andes (Vera and Díaz, 2015; de Barros Soares et 
al., 2017; Boisier et al., 2018; de Abreu et al., 2019). Despite that, there is limited evidence that human-
induced greenhouse gas emissions had an influence on the 2014/2015 water shortage in Southeast Brazil 
(Otto et al., 2015). Extreme event attribution on sub-continental scales is assessed in Chapter 11 and 
continental-scale attribution in Chapter 3. 
 
In summary, analyses of historical temperature time series point strongly to an increased warming trend 
(high confidence) across many South American regions, except for a cooling off the Chilean coast. Annual 
rainfall has increased over south-eastern South America and decreased in most tropical land regions, 
particularly in central Chile (high confidence). The number and strength of extreme events, such as extreme 
temperatures, droughts and floods, have already increased (medium confidence) (see Table 11.7).  
 
It is noted that the major barrier to the study of climate change in many regions of South America is still the 
absence or insufficiency of long time series of observational data (Carvalho, 2020; Condom et al., 2020). 
Most national datasets were created in the 1970s and 1980s, preventing a more comprehensive long-term 
trend analysis. To fulfil the users’ demand for climatological and meteorological data products covering the 
whole region, several interpolation techniques have been used with reanalysis and gridded gauge-analysis 
products to add the necessary spatial detail to the climate analyses over land and for climate variability and 
trend studies but these are subject to uncertainties (Skansi et al., 2013; Rozante et al., 2020). 
 
 
### Atlas.7.2.3  Assessment of model performance 
 
Since AR5 the number of publications on climate model performance and their projections in South America 
has increased, particularly for regional climate modelling studies (Giorgi et al., 2009; Boulanger et al., 2016; 
Ambrizzi et al., 2019) and the understanding of their strengths and weaknesses (high confidence).  
 
Most global and regional climate models can simulate reasonably well the current climatological features of 
South America, such as seasonal mean and annual cycles. However, significant biases persist mainly at 
regional scales (high confidence) (Torres and Marengo, 2013; Blázquez and Nuñez, 2013b; Gulizia et al., 
2013; Joetzjer et al., 2013; Jones and Carvalho, 2013; Gulizia and Camilloni, 2015; Zazulie et al., 2017a; 
Abadi et al., 2018; Barros and Doyle, 2018; Solman and Blázquez, 2019; Teichmann et al., 2020; Fan et al., 
2020; Rivera and Arnould, 2020). During the dry season, precipitation is underestimated in most models 
over Amazonia (medium evidence and high agreement) (Torres and Marengo, 2013; Yin et al., 2013; Solman 
and Blázquez, 2019). Over regions with complex orography, such as the tropical Andes of NWS, CMIP5 
models tend to underestimate precipitation which is associated with the misrepresentation of the Pacific 
ITCZ and the local low-level jets (Sierra et al., 2015, 2018), whereas over the subtropical central Andes in 
SWS, the models are found to overestimate both mean temperature and precipitation values (limited evidence 
and high agreement) (Zazulie et al., 2017b; Rivera and Arnould, 2020; Díaz et al., 2021). Most models show 
a dry bias over SES (Díaz and Vera, 2017; Barros and Doyle, 2018; Solman and Blázquez, 2019; Díaz et al., 
2021) associated with an underestimation of the northern flow that brings water vapour into the region 
(medium confidence) (Gulizia et al., 2013; Zazulie et al., 2017a; Barros and Doyle, 2018). The biases in 
seasonal precipitation, annual precipitation and climate extremes over several regions of South America were 
reduced, including the Amazon, central South America, Bolivia, eastern Argentina and Uruguay, in the 
CMIP5 models when compared to those of CMIP3 (medium confidence) (Joetzjer et al., 2013; Gulizia and 
Camilloni, 2015; Díaz and Vera, 2017). The evidence is still insufficient to determine whether CMIP6 biases 
are reduced when compared with CMIP5 simulations regarding precipitation and its variability in South 
America. The temperature and precipitation patterns of anomalies associated with ENSO in the tropical 
South America (NWS, NSA and NES) are better captured by GCMs in tropical South America (NWS, NSA 
and NES) than in extra-tropical South America (SES), particularly during austral summer and autumn 
(limited evidence and high agreement) (Tedeschi and Collins, 2016; Perry et al., 2020). 
 
Based on regional simulations, studies showed that some RCMs improve the quality of the simulated climate 
when compared with the driving GCM (medium evidence and high agreement) (Llopart et al., 2014; Sánchez 
et al., 2015; Falco et al., 2019; Solman and Blázquez, 2019; Ciarlo et al., 2020; Teichmann et al., 2020). 
Regional climate model (RCM) simulations over South America can reproduce the main features of 
temperature and precipitation in terms of both spatial distributions (Solman et al., 2013; Falco et al., 2019) 
and seasonal cycles over the different climate regimes, including the main SAmerM features (high 
confidence) (Jacob et al., 2012; Solman, 2013; Llopart et al., 2014; Reboita et al., 2014a; de Jesus et al., 
2016; Lyra et al., 2018; Bozkurt et al., 2019; Ashfaq et al., 2020). However, RCMs showed systematic biases 
such as precipitation overestimations and temperature underestimations along the Andes throughout the 
(high confidence) although these biases may be artificially amplified by the lack of a dense observational 
station network (Jacob et al., 2012; Solman et al., 2013; Bozkurt et al., 2019; Falco et al., 2019). RCMs 
tended to show dry biases over the Amazon and the northern part of the continent (SAM, NSA) during DJF 
and during the maximum precipitation associated with the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) over NSA 
during JJA (medium evidence and high agreement) (Solman et al., 2013; Falco et al., 2019). Temperature 
overestimation and precipitation underestimation over La Plata Basin (in SES) are also RCM common biases 
with the warm bias amplified for austral summer and the dry bias amplified for the rainy season (high 
confidence) (Solman et al., 2013; Reboita et al., 2014a; Solman, 2016; Falco et al., 2019). Despite their 
relevance RCM simulations at very high resolution (less than 10 km) are still few in South America (high 
confidence) and are mainly designed for specific regions or purposes (Lyra et al., 2018; Bozkurt et al., 2019; 
Bettolli et al., 2021). 
 
The evaluation of statistical downscaling models (ESD) in representing regional climate features in South 
America has increased since the AR5, however there are still few ESD studies over the different subregions. 
Precipitation simulations based on ESD models are able to reproduce mean precipitation over tropical and 
subtropical South American regions, especially over maximum precipitation areas in western Colombia, 
south-eastern Peru, central Bolivia, Chile and the La Plata basin (medium confidence) (Souvignet et al., 
2010; Mendes et al., 2014; Palomino-Lemus et al., 2015, 2017, 2018; Troin et al., 2016; Soares dos Santos et 
al., 2016; Borges et al., 2017; Bettolli and Penalba, 2018; Araya-Osses et al., 2020; Bettolli et al., 2021). 
Temperature simulations are fewer but show added value to GCM simulations (medium evidence and high 
agreement) (Souvignet et al., 2010; Borges et al., 2017; Bettolli and Penalba, 2018; Araya-Osses et al., 
2020). 
 
Overall, climate modelling has made some progress in the past decade but there is no model that performs 
well in simulating all aspects of the present climate over South America (high confidence). The performance 
of the models varies according to the region, time scale, and variables analysed (Abadi et al., 2018). There is 
also a fairly narrow spread in the representation of temperature and precipitation over South America by the 
CMIP5 GCMs and also the RCMs, with biases that can be associated with the parametrizations and schemes 
of surface, boundary layer, microphysics and radiation used by the models. Finally, observational reference 
datasets, such as reanalysis products, used in the calibration and validation of climate models also can be 
quite uncertain and may explain part of the apparent biases present in climate models (high confidence).  
 
 
### Atlas.7.2.4  Assessment and synthesis of projections 
 
It is very likely that annual mean temperature will increase over South America, with a wide range of 
projected changes of 1.0°C to 6.0°C by the end of the 21st century (from RCP2.6/SSP1-2.6 to RCP8.5/SSP5-
8.5 emissions, Figure Atlas.22). Overall, GCMs project higher temperature change than RCMs in austral 
summer and winter over all subregions and in winter mainly over the central part of the continent (Coppola 
et al., 2014; Llopart et al., 2020; Teichmann et al., 2020) (see also the Interactive Atlas). The largest 
warmings over the South American continent are projected for the Amazon basin (SAM and NSA) and the 
central Andes range (southern SAM, northern SWS and south-eastern NWS), Figure Atlas.22, especially 
during the dry and dry-to-wet transition seasons (austral winter and spring) (Blázquez and Nuñez, 2013a; 
Coppola et al., 2014; Pabón-Caicedo et al., 2020; Teichmann et al., 2020) (high confidence). 
 
Using warming levels (Figure Atlas.22), the temperature is projected to increase at or above the level of 
global warming in all regions apart from SSA with additional warming (compared to a 1995–2014 baseline) 
of over 4°C for the 4°C warming level in NSA and SAM. Changes for other warming levels, subregions and 
emissions pathways are shown in Figure Atlas.22 and can be explored with the Interactive Atlas. 
 
In general, models show a wide regional range in the direction and the magnitude of mean precipitation 
change in many South American regions, with large significant increases and decreases (Figure Atlas.22, 
Interactive Atlas). In the medium and long term, under the high-emission scenario, the CMIP5 multi-model 
ensemble projected an increase in precipitation (generally greater than 10%) in SES and NWS and a decrease 
(less 10%) in NSA across seasons (high confidence, robust evidence) (Solman, 2013; Chou et al., 2014; 
Coppola et al., 2014; Llopart et al., 2014, 2020, Reboita et al., 2014b, 2020; Sánchez et al., 2015; Menéndez 
et al., 2016; Ruscica et al., 2016; Bozkurt et al., 2018a; Zaninelli et al., 2019). Also, in parts of SWS, annual 
precipitation is projected to decrease (up 30%) by the late 21st century (Souvignet et al., 2010; Palomino-
Lemus et al., 2017, 2018; Bozkurt et al., 2018a). Under high RCPs, the CMIP5 ensemble projects that all 
Brazilian regions will experience more rainfall variability in the future, so drier dry periods and wetter wet 
periods on daily, weekly, monthly and seasonal timescales, despite the future changes in mean rainfall being 
currently uncertain (medium confidence) (Alves et al., 2020). Regarding the SAmerM, it is very likely that 
the monsoon will experience changes in its life cycle by the end of the 21st century for both RCP4.5 and 
RCP8.5 emissions and, in particular, delayed onset. However there is low agreement on the projected 
changes in terms of extreme and total precipitation of the monsoon season in South America (Llopart et al., 
2014; Ashfaq et al., 2020). Changes in the SAmerM are assessed in Section 8.3.2.4.5. 
 
Projected changes in seasonal precipitation and their uncertainties generally agree with the annual changes, 
particularly for the decreases in SWS (Figure Atlas.22). DJF precipitation changes in NSA and SAM are 
largely uncertain, with weak agreements in the projections, particularly for CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensembles, 
which project almost no change and decreasing precipitation for NSA and a narrow range from slight 
increases to no change respectively for SAM. 
 
 
### Atlas.7.2.5  Summary 
 
In summary, it is virtually certain that the climate of South America has warmed. Studies on climate trends 
in South America indicate that mean temperature, maximum and minimum temperatures have increased over 
the last 40 years. Long-term observed precipitation trends show an increase over south-eastern South 
America and decreases in most tropical land regions (high confidence).  
 
Evaluation of global and regional climate model simulations have increased over South America in the past 
decade and shown improved performance. However, the results reveal that no model performs well in 
simulating all aspects of the present climate (very likely). On the other hand, there is still a lack of high-
quality and high-resolution observational data that may explain part of the important biases present in 
climate models (high confidence). 
 
Climate model projections show a general increase in annual mean surface temperature over the coming 
century for all emission scenarios (RCPs and SSPs) (high confidence) consistent with the observed warming 
and with all regions except SSA warming faster than the global average. Unlike temperature, annual 
precipitation has patterns of decrease in North-eastern South America (NES) and South-western South 
America (SWS) and increase in southern South America (SES) and North-western South America (NWS) 
(high confidence), with small changes projected under a low-emission scenario. However, there is low 
confidence in the magnitude because of the large spread among models, both GCMs and RCMs. 
 
 
# Atlas.8  Europe 
 
The assessment in this section focuses on changes in average temperature and precipitation (rainfall and 
snow), including the most recent years of observations, updates to observed datasets, the consideration of 
recent studies using CMIP5 and those using CMIP6 and CORDEX simulations. Assessment of changes in 
extremes are in Chapter 11 (Table 11.16–11.18) and climatic impact-drivers in Chapter 12 (Table 12.7). 

## Atlas.8.1  Key features of the regional climate and findings from previous IPCC assessments 
 
### Atlas.8.1.1  Key features of the regional climate 
 
Westerly winds and the accompanying Atlantic storm track with cyclones and anticyclones travelling from 
the Atlantic towards inland Europe are the main climatic features that characterize daily to inter-annual 
variability in the European region. The Siberian High in winter determines cold weather in East Europe and 
can affect other regions with cold outbreaks. Intra-seasonal and inter-annual variations are driven by modes 
of climate variability such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (see Table Atlas.1 and Annex IV.2). Global 
warming can lead to systematic changes in regional climate variability via thermodynamic responses such as 
altered lapse rates (Kröner et al., 2017; Brogli et al., 2019) and land-atmosphere feedbacks (Zampieri and 
Lionello, 2011; Boé and Terray, 2014). Regional feedbacks involving the land-sea contrast, sea surface, land 
surface, clouds, aerosols, radiation and other processes modulate the regional response to enhanced warming.  
 
Four climatic regions are defined for Europe (see Figure Atlas.24). The Mediterranean region (MED) in the 
south is characterized by mild winters and hot and dry summers (Mediterranean climate; see Section 
10.6.4.2). It covers both Europe and Africa, and MED assessments in this section generally imply the entire 
MED domain unless stated otherwise. The Western and Central Europe region (WCE) has distinct summer 
and winter seasons with increasing continentality of climate eastwards. The northern region (NEU), close to 
the Atlantic Ocean, is characterized by high humidity and relatively mild winters, and strong exposure to the 
Atlantic storm track. Eastern Europe (EEU) covers the western part of Russia and neighbouring territories 
and has continental characteristics. Many regional datasets and model projections assessed here do not 
sufficiently cover the EEU region. 
 
 
### Atlas.8.1.2  Findings from previous IPCC assessments 
 
AR5 WG II (Kovats et al., 2014) reports with high confidence that observed climate trends show regionally 
varying changes in temperature and rainfall in Europe. The average temperature in Europe has continued to 
increase, with seasonally different rates of warming being greatest in high latitudes in Northern Europe. 
Annual precipitation has increased in Northern Europe and decreased in parts of Southern Europe. SROCC 
(Hock et al., 2019b) reports with high confidence that a reduction in snow cover at low elevation and glacier 
extent is observed in recent decades, with consequent changes in annual and seasonal runoff patterns. 
According to the SRCCL report (IPCC, 2019b) there is high agreement that observed vegetation greening 
and forestation in the last 30 years cools summertime surface temperature and warms winter temperature due 
to decreased snow cover and increased snow shading in forested areas. It is very likely that aerosol column 
amounts have declined over Europe since the mid-1980s.  
 
AR5 (Collins et al., 2013) reports that the ability of models to simulate the climate in Europe has improved 
in many important aspects. Particularly relevant for this region are increased model resolution and a better 
representation of the land-surface processes in many of the models that participated in CMIP5. The spread in 
climate model projections is still substantial, partly due to pronounced internal variability in this region 
(particularly NAO and AMO). In the winter half year, NEU and WCE are likely to have increased mean 
precipitation associated with increased atmospheric moisture and moisture convergence and intensification 
in extratropical cyclone activity. No change or a moderate reduction is projected for MED. In the summer 
half year, it is likely that NEU and WCE mean precipitation will have only small changes with a notable 
reduction in MED. According to SR1.5 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018), these precipitation changes are more 
pronounced at 2°C than at 1.5°C of global warming. For a 2°C global warming, an increase in runoff is 
projected for north-eastern Europe while decreases are projected in the Mediterranean region, where runoff 
differences between 1.5°C and 2°C global warming will be most prominent (medium confidence). According 
to SROCC (Hock et al., 2019b) the RCP8.5 projections lead to a loss of more than 80% of the ice mass from 
small glaciers by the end of century in Central Europe (high confidence). Snow cover and glaciers are 
projected to decrease all along the 21st century. 


## Atlas.8.2  Assessment and synthesis of observations, trends and attribution 
 
To support climatological analyses and model evaluation, national meteorological and hydrological services 
are increasingly making available high spatial and temporal resolution gridded and in situ homogenized and 
quality-checked datasets (Déqué and Somot, 2008; Vidal et al., 2010; Rauthe et al., 2013; Noël et al., 2015; 
Spinoni et al., 2015b; Ruti et al., 2016; Fantini et al., 2018; Lussana et al., 2018; Herrera et al., 2019; 
Skrynyk et al., 2020). The inclusion of additional station data and data rescue activities lead to a better 
representation of extreme precipitation statistics than the global- or continental-scale datasets (see Section 
Atlas.1.4.1). Recent gridded products merging radar and station data allow higher spatial and temporal 
resolutions to be reached (Haiden et al., 2011; Tabary et al., 2011; Berg et al., 2016; Fumière et al., 2020). A 
number of regional reanalysis products has become available for the European region (Bollmeyer et al., 
2015; Bach et al., 2016; Dahlgren et al., 2016; Landelius et al., 2016). A European ensemble of regional 
reanalyses from 1961 to 2019 is shown to add accuracy and reliability in comparison to global reanalysis 
products, but also introduces additional uncertainties, especially for threshold-based climate indices (Kaiser-
Weiss et al., 2019). However, gridded European datasets are unreliable over data-sparse regions. Also, many 
datasets employ different approaches to interpolation and gridding, which adds to their uncertainty and 
complicates comparative evaluations (Berthou et al., 2018; Fantini et al., 2018; Kotlarski et al., 2019). For 
some subregions and performance metrics differences between datasets have been shown to be of the same 
magnitude as errors in regional climate models (Prein et al., 2016; Prein and Gobiet, 2017; Fantini et al., 
2018), but observational uncertainty is substantially reduced when datasets of similar nature and 
representativeness are used (Kotlarski et al., 2019).  
 
In addition to the global display of observed temperature and precipitation trends in Figure Atlas.11, annual 
mean temperature and precipitation trends between 1980 and 2015 calculated from the gridded ensemble E-
OBS dataset (Cornes et al., 2018) are shown in Figure Atlas.23, together with time series of temperature and 
precipitation anomalies relative to the 1980–2015 mean value from E-OBS, CRU, EWEMBI and Berkeley 
for temperature, and E-OBS, CRU, GPCC and GPCP for precipitation (see also Figure 2.11 for global mean 
values, and Section Atlas.1.4.1 for description of global datasets).  
 
In NEU continued warming has been observed, particularly during spring. An annual mean temperature 
increase of 0.4°C per decade was reported between 1970 and 2008 (Rutgersson et al., 2015). In WCE 
temperature increases since the mid 20th century have been documented for Poland (Degirmendžić et al., 
2004) and Ukraine (Boychenko et al., 2016; Balabukh and Malitskaya, 2017). Land-only observations 
indicate a rapid increase in summer (JJA) mean surface air temperature since the mid-1990s (Dong et al., 
2017). In Eastern Europe no significant trend in winter mean air temperatures was found between 1881 and 
2016 in Belarus (Loginov et al., 2018). In parts of the European area of the MED spring and summer 
temperatures are reported to increase faster than in the other seasons (Brunetti et al., 2006; Homar et al., 
2009; Lionello et al., 2012; Philandras et al., 2015; Gonzalez-Hidalgo et al., 2016; Vicente-Serrano et al., 
2017) (see also the Mediterranean case study in Section 10.6.4 and Figure 10.18). Figure Atlas.23 shows that 
since 1980 in each European region all datasets show a consistent warming of annual mean temperature of 
0.04°C yr–1 to 0.05°C yr–1. Trends in European land temperature cannot be explained without accounting for 
anthropogenic warming offset by anthropogenic aerosol emissions (see Section 8.3.1.1 and Figure 3.8). It is 
virtually certain that annual mean temperature continues to increase in each European subdomain. 
 
Multidecadal trends in mean precipitation are generally small and non-significant. Apart from difficulties 
related to observational coverage (Prein and Gobiet, 2017), gauge undercatch (e.g., Murphy et al., 2019) and 
data inhomogeneity (e.g., Camuffo et al., 2013), strong interannual and multidecadal variability is dominant 
over at least the last two centuries. However, significant precipitation trends have been recorded for recent 
periods, for example in south-western Europe between 1960 and 2000 (Peña-Angulo et al., 2020) and 
between 1961 and 2015 in NEU (Interactive Atlas). Also, some studies suggest that in the MED precipitation 
has declined and more frequent and severe meteorological droughts have occurred between 1960 and 2000 
(Spinoni et al., 2015a; Gudmundsson and Seneviratne, 2016), and in some regions cannot be explained 
without anthropogenic forcing (Knutson and Zeng, 2018) (see also Section 10.4.1.2). Other studies suggest 
that this trend can be seen as an expression of multidecadal internal variability driven mainly by the North 
Atlantic Oscillation (Table Atlas.1) (Kelley et al., 2012; Zittis, 2018). Global dimming and brightening also 
are reported to affect precipitation trends in the Mediterranean region (see Section 8.3.1.6 and Figure 8.7). 
 
The large-scale spatial patterns of the E-OBS annual mean precipitation trend between 1980 and 2015 shown 
in Figure Atlas.23 is broadly consistent with trends derived from CRU, GPCP and GPCC (Figure Atlas.11) 
but with more explicit spatial detail. Trends calculated for regional averages are sensitive to the selection of 
the time window: for 1980–2015 annual mean precipitation averaged over the regions shows a positive trend 
(not significant at p = 0.05), while for CRU and GPCC the trend calculated over 1901–2015 is positive for 
NEU, EEU and WCE, and non-significant for MED. Precipitation trends in the MED are significant only in 
selected areas (Lionello et al., 2012; MedECC, 2020). Also the NEU trends show large spatial variability and 
are subject to decadal variability related to NAO (Heikkilä and Sorteberg, 2012), but are generally positive 
over the 20th century (Figure Atlas.23). There is medium confidence that annual mean precipitation in NEU, 
WCE and EEU has increased since the early 20th century. In the European Mediterranean observed land 
precipitation trends show pronounced variability within the region, with magnitude and sign of trend in the 
past century depending on time period and exact study region (medium confidence). 
 
Trends in snowfall and snow melt are related to seasonal changes in both temperature and precipitation. In 
EEU melt onset dates have advanced by 1–2 weeks in the 1979–2012 period (Mioduszewski et al., 2015). 
Over Eurasia, trends in spring and early summer snow cover extent increased over the 1971–2014 period 
(Hernández-Henríquez et al., 2015). Between 1966 and 2012, averaged over entire Eurasia, monthly mean 
snow depth decreased in autumn and increased in winter and spring (Zhong et al., 2018), while the snow 
cover extent was reported to have decreased during the past 40 years (Bulygina et al., 2011). In NEU late 
winter and early spring snow depth and snow cover decreases since the early 1960s are reported over Finland 
(Luomaranta et al., 2019) and Norway (Rizzi et al., 2018) with a dependence on altitude (Skaugen et al., 
2012), while winter snow depth increased in northern Sweden (Kohler et al., 2006). It is very likely that since 
the early 1980s in snow-dominant areas in NEU and EEU the length of the snowfall season is reduced with 
regional warming, and the melt onset dates have advanced.  
 
<figref>ATLAS.23</figref> 
 
The increasing trend in surface shortwave radiation, documented in AR5 (Hartmann et al., 2013) to have 
occurred since the 1980s and referred to as a brightening effect, is substantiated over Europe and the 
Mediterranean region (Nabat et al., 2014; Sanchez‐Lorenzo et al., 2015; Cherif et al., 2020). This increasing 
trend has been attributed to the decrease in anthropogenic sulphate aerosols over the 1980–2012 period 
(Nabat et al., 2014). In model sensitivity experiments, the aerosol trend has been quantified to explain 81 ± 
16% of the European surface shortwave trend and 23 ± 5% of the European surface temperature warming. It 
is likely that trends in anthropogenic aerosols in Europe have generated positive trends in shortwave 
radiation and surface temperature since the 1980s (see also Sections 6.3.3.1, 8.3.1.6 and 10.6.4). 

Assessments of observed European trends in meteorological extremes and CIDs are reported elsewhere in 
this report. Section 11.3.5 documents and attributes an increase in the frequency and extent of heatwaves and 
daily maximum temperatures, and Section 11.6.2 discusses the uncertainty concerning the detection of trends 
in meteorological droughts, and the role of increasing atmospheric evaporative demand on hydrological and 
ecological/agricultural droughts. Section 8.3.1.8 reports on increasing aridity trends in the Mediterranean 
related to soil moisture declines and increases in atmospheric water vapor demand. Section 11.4.2 reports on 
the increased likelihood and intensity of daily precipitation extremes, while Sections 11.5.2 and 12.4.5.2 
discuss implications for peak streamflow. Section 12.4.5.5 discusses the increased likelihood of wildfires, 
while Section 12.4.5.3 discusses the substantial decadal variability in mean wind speed and the trends in 
wind storms and gusts. The acceleration of sea level rise in the Atlantic and European seas has been 
discussed in Section 12.4.5.5.  
 
 
## Atlas.8.3  Assessment of model performance 
 
A global evaluation of annual mean temperature and precipitation from the CMIP6 ensemble is presented in 
Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 respectively. In general, annual mean temperature is slightly underestimated at high 
latitudes and overestimated in the MED area. Temporal evolution of decadal temperature oscillations in 
Europe simulated by the CMIP6 historical simulations is well reproduced (Fan et al., 2020). Fernandez-
Granja et al. (2021) report an overall improvement of CMIP6 compared to CMIP5 to reproduce atmospheric 
weather patterns over Europe. 
 
Regional climate models (RCMs; Section 10.3.1.2) have been extensively evaluated for a range of climate 
features over Europe (Casanueva et al., 2016; Vaittinada Ayar et al., 2016; Ivanov et al., 2017; Krakovska et 
al., 2017; Terzago et al., 2017; Cavicchia et al., 2018; Drobinski et al., 2018; Fantini et al., 2018; Harzallah 
et al., 2018; Panthou et al., 2018b). Standard assessments of RCMs driven by reanalyses, typically run at 12– 
25 km spatial resolution, confirm that the Euro-CORDEX and Med-CORDEX ensembles are capable of 
reproducing the salient features of European climate (Kotlarski et al., 2014; Krakovska, 2018) and represent 
European circulation features realistically (Cardoso et al., 2016; Drobinski et al., 2018; Flaounas et al., 2018; 
Sanchez-Gomez and Somot, 2018). Seasonal and regionally averaged temperature biases generally do not 
exceed 1.5°C, while precipitation biases can be up to ±40% (Kotlarski et al., 2014). Extensive evaluation of a 
large collection of RCM-GCM combinations show a general wet, cold and windy bias compared to 
observations and reanalyses, but none of the models is systematically performing best or worst (Vautard et 
al., 2020). Higher-resolution simulations do show improved performance in reproducing the spatial patterns 
and seasonal cycle of not only extreme precipitation but also mean precipitation over all European regions 
(Mayer et al., 2015; Fantini et al., 2018; Soares and Cardoso, 2018; Ciarlo et al., 2020)(see also Sections 
10.3.3.4 and 10.3.3.5 for an extensive evaluation of the added value of increased simulation resolution).  
 
In line with findings reported in Section 10.3.3.8, several studies argue that both GCMs and RCMs 
underestimate the observed trend in European summer temperature (Dosio, 2016; Boé et al., 2020b), 
indicating that essential processes are missing or that the natural variability is not correctly sampled 
(Dell’Aquila et al., 2018). Nabat et al. (2014) argued that including realistic aerosol variations enables 
climate models to correctly reproduce the summer warming trend (as is required for attributing continental 
annual temperature trends, Section 8.3.1.1). However, other studies showed models to be sensitive also to 
local effects, such as land-surface processes, convection, microphysics, and snow albedo (Vautard et al., 
2013; Davin et al., 2016). In Euro-CORDEX the warm and dry summer bias over southern and south-eastern 
Europe is reduced compared to the previous ENSEMBLES simulations (Katragkou et al., 2015; Giot et al., 
2016; Prein and Gobiet, 2017; Dell’Aquila et al., 2018). Natural variability has strongly affected the 
historical warming and large ensembles are necessary for a correct estimation of the forced signal versus 
natural variability (Aalbers et al., 2018; Lehner et al., 2020).  
 
Specific assessments of Convection Permitting RCMs (CPRCMs, running at a resolution of typically 1 to 3 
km and designed for extreme precipitation characteristics) is undertaken in Section 10.3.3.4.1. A unique 
CPRCM ensemble has been applied over the great Alpine domain and improves representation of mean and 
extreme precipitation compared to coarser resolution models (Ban et al., 2021; Pichelli et al., 2021). 

The role of aerosol forcing is increasingly analysed as new and more realistic aerosol datasets become 
available (Nabat et al., 2013; Pavlidis et al., 2020), and as RCMs begin to include interactive aerosols (Nabat 
et al., 2012, 2015, 2020; Drugé et al., 2019). Explicitly accounting for aerosol effects in RCMs leads to 
improved representation of the surface shortwave radiation at various scales: long-term means (Gutiérrez et 
al., 2018), day-to-day variability (Nabat et al., 2015), and long-term trends (Nabat et al., 2014).  
 
New, or updated, higher-resolution, coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice model systems have been found to 
improve simulations of observed climate features over the Baltic area compared to atmosphere-only model 
versions, including correlation between precipitation and SST, between surface heat-flux components and 
SST, and weather events like convective snow bands over the Baltic Sea (e.g., Tian et al., 2013; Van Pham et 
al., 2014; Gröger et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015a; Pham et al., 2017). Coupled atmosphere-land-river-ocean 
Regional Climate System Models (RCSMs) from Med-CORDEX have similar skill as the ENSEMBLES and 
the Euro-CORDEX ensembles to represent decadal variability of Mediterranean climate and its extremes 
(Cavicchia et al., 2018; Dell’Aquila et al., 2018; Gaertner et al., 2018). Panthou et al. (2018b) showed that, 
over land, differences between atmosphere-only and coupled RCMs are confined to coastal areas that are 
directly influenced by SST anomalies. In contrast, Van Pham et al. (2014) showed significant differences in 
seasonal mean temperature across a widespread continental domain.  
 
Statistical downscaling methods are assessed in Section 10.3.3.7, including the intercomparison and 
evaluation activities performed in the framework of VALUE and Euro-CORDEX over Europe. 
 
 
## Atlas.8.4  Assessment and synthesis of projections 
 
Simulations from CMIP5 and CMIP6 indicate pronounced geographical patterns and scenario dependence of 
the projections of mean temperature and precipitation. Global warming projected under SSP5-8.5 emissions 
in CMIP6 exceeds the warming projected by RCP8.5 emissions in CMIP5 (Forster et al., 2019) (see also 
Section 4.3). In selected regions in Europe CMIP6 also projects a systematically higher mean temperature 
than CMIP5 (Seneviratne and Hauser, 2020). The annual mean projections from CMIP5, CMIP6 and 0.11° 
resolution EURO-CORDEX contained in the Interactive Atlas are shown for the four European regions in 
Figure Atlas.24. For each region and season a warming offset between the preindustrial (1850–1900) and the 
recent past (1995–2014) baselines is also shown. The results confirm higher CMIP6 long-term annual mean 
warming rates for WCE, EEU and MED and a larger inter-model spread for each region. For given global 
warming levels, regional annual mean temperature change in CMIP5 and CMIP6 are largely consistent and 
higher than the global average, most prominently in EEU. For high warming levels the CMIP5 subset of 8 
GCMs used to drive the EURO-CORDEX simulations show a lower annual mean temperature change than 
the full CMIP5 ensemble in each of the European subregions. This illustrates the large inter-model spread 
and implications for subsampling a relatively small subset from the full ensemble. Regional warming is 
strongest in continental EEU away from the Atlantic and in MED during summer (Lionello and Scarascia, 
2018). The assessment of EURO-CORDEX projections for levels of global warming of 1.5°C and 2.0°C 
indicate enhanced local warming even at relatively low global warming levels, particularly towards the north 
in winter (Schaller et al., 2016; Dosio and Fischer, 2018; Kjellström et al., 2018; Teichmann et al., 2018). 
 
Some signatures of climate change projected by GCMs are modified by RCMs and CPRCMs. Projections of 
temperature, precipitation and wind in RCMs may deviate from GCM signals dependent on the dominant 
atmospheric circulation (Kjellström et al., 2018). In many areas RCMs produce lower warming rates and 
higher precipitation (less drying) in summer (Fernández et al., 2019; Boé et al., 2020a). Also for mean 
surface shortwave radiation systematic differences between GCM and RCM outputs are found (Bartók et al., 
2017; Gutiérrez et al., 2020). Although RCMs generally have a smaller bias for the present climate (Sørland 
et al., 2018) and better cloud representation (Bartók et al., 2017), the representation of aerosol forcing (Boé 
et al., 2020a; Gutiérrez et al., 2020), air-sea coupling (Boé et al., 2020a) or vegetation response to elevated 
atmospheric CO2 (Schwingshackl et al., 2019) give rise to systematic biases in RCM projections. The 
comparison between EURO-CORDEX and the CMIP5 subset shown in Figure Atlas.24 illustrates that the 
RCMs primarily modify the climate change warming signal from the driving GCMs for MED and WCE in 
summer (Boé et al., 2020a). 

Changes in precipitation clearly show a seasonal signature and a meridional gradient over Europe. Mean 
precipitation increases by 4% to 5% per °C of global warming in NEU, EEU and WCE in DJF, and 
decreases in summer in WCE and MED (Jacob et al., 2018) (see Figure Atlas.24). CMIP5 projections of 
precipitation change in MED are strongest in DJF in the south, while changes in JJA are dominant in the 
northern (European) part of MED, Lionello and Scarascia (2018). The European north-south gradient in 
precipitation response is confirmed by the EURO-CORDEX experiment (Coppola et al., 2020), but Figure 
Atlas.24 shows that the JJA precipitation reduction in WCE projected by CMIP5 and CMIP6 at higher 
warming levels has low confidence in the CORDEX simulations. Precipitation in JJA in EEU is reduced in 
CMIP6, while little change is shown in CMIP5. Quantitative estimations of climate change features from 
regional climate projections in Eastern Europe (Partasenok et al., 2015; Kattsov et al., 2017) have low 
confidence due to the use of relatively small ensembles of GCMs and/or RCMs, and limited evaluation of 
model performance in the region.  
 
Over specific geographic features such as high mountains, RCMs further modify the climate change signal of 
precipitation simulated by the low-resolution GCMs (Giorgi et al., 2016; Torma and Giorgi, 2020). This is 
especially true for summer precipitation over the Alps where opposite signs of changes in mean and extreme 
precipitation are generated by the CMIP5 GCM ensemble and the 12-km Med-CORDEX and EURO-
CORDEX RCM ensembles (Giorgi et al., 2016) (see also Section 10.6.4.7).  
 
<figref>ATLAS.24</figref> 
 
Regional warming is virtually certain to extend the observed downward trends in snow accumulation, snow 
water equivalent and length of the snow cover season in NEU and low altitudes in mountainous areas in the 
Alps and Pyrenees (very high confidence). This is supported by regional and global multi-model and/or 
single-model ensemble projections including CMIP5, PRUDENCE, ENSEMBLES and EURO-CORDEX 
(Jylhä et al., 2008; Steger et al., 2013; Mankin and Diffenbaugh, 2015; Schmucki et al., 2015; Marty et al., 
2017; Frei et al., 2018) and attributed to changes in the snowfall fraction of precipitation and to increased 
snow melt. In mountain areas a strong dependence of projected snow trends on altitude is shown, with most 
pronounced effects below 1500 m (López-Moreno et al., 2009). Terzago et al. (2017) showed a large positive 
bias in the amplitude of the annual snow cycle of EURO-CORDEX 0.11° simulations driven by GCM 
projections, while reanalysis-driven RCMs showed good agreement with in-situ observations.  
 
Regional ocean warming in projections with RCSMs for the Baltic and North Sea (Gröger et al., 2015) and 
for the Mediterranean (Darmaraki et al., 2019) is associated with increased intensity and frequency of marine 
heatwaves in the Mediterranean (see Section 12.4.5.5), strong freshening in the Baltic, and, for some 
simulations, changes in the circulation in response to non-uniform changes in air-sea interaction (Dieterich et 
al., 2019). Med-CORDEX RCSM and CMIP5 GCM results agree well on the Mediterranean SST warming 
rate (Mariotti et al., 2015; Darmaraki et al., 2019); see also the Interactive Atlas. 
 
Assessments of projected changes in meteorological extremes and CIDs are reported elsewhere in this report. 
Extreme precipitation and temperature often exhibit a different response to global warming than mean 
values. Increased intensity and frequency of extreme temperatures and heatwaves is assessed in Sections 
11.3.5 and 12.4.5.1. Changes in the hydrological cycle include enhanced soil moisture decline in southern 
Europe, drying in summer and autumn in central Europe, and spring drought due to early snow melt in 
northern Europe (Sections 8.4.1, 11.6.5 and 12.4.5.2). Changes in mean and extreme wind are very uncertain 
(Section 12.4.5.3), while sea level rise will increase the frequency of occurrence of extreme sea level at most 
European coasts (Section 12.4.5.5). 
 
 
## Atlas.8.5  Summary 
 
An assessment of recent literature largely confirms the findings of previous IPCC reports but with additional 
detail and (in some cases) higher confidence due to improvements in observations, reanalyses and methods. 
Observational data sets with global coverage are complemented by the E-OBS gridded ensemble temperature 
and precipitation dataset, a range of regional observational analyses, and regional reanalysis products. New 
RCM experiments, including CPRCMs and regional coupled climate system models, mostly coordinated 
under the umbrella of CORDEX, have generated many new projections and process studies.  
 
The representation of mean European climate features by GCMs and RCMs is improved compared to 
previous IPCC assessments (medium confidence), in spite of persisting biases in annual mean and seasonal 
temperature and precipitation characteristics. The added value of regional downscaling of GCMs by RCM 
projections for summer mean temperature, precipitation and shortwave radiation is constrained by the 
representation of processes that lead to a systematic difference between RCM and driving GCM, such as 
aerosol forcing (medium confidence).  
 
It is virtually certain that annual mean temperature continues to increase in each European region. There is 
medium confidence that annual mean precipitation in NEU, WCE and EEU has increased since the early 20th 
century. In the European Mediterranean trends in annual mean precipitation contain substantial spatial and 
temporal variability (medium confidence). It is very likely that since the early 1980s in snow-dominant areas 
in NEU and EEU the length of the snowfall season is reduced with regional warming, and the melt onset 
dates have advanced. It is likely that decreasing trends in anthropogenic aerosols in Europe have generated 
positive trends in shortwave radiation and surface temperature since the 1980s. 
 
At increasing levels of global warming, there is very high confidence that temperature will increase in all 
European areas at a rate exceeding global mean temperature increases, while increased mean precipitation 
amounts at high latitudes in DJF and reduced JJA precipitation in southern Europe will occur with medium 
confidence for global warming levels of 2°C or less, and with high confidence for higher warming levels. At 
high latitudes and low-altitude mountain areas in Europe strong declines in snow accumulation are virtually 
certain to occur with further increasing regional temperatures (very high confidence).  
 
 
# Atlas.9  North America 
 
The assessment in this section focuses on changes in average temperature and precipitation (rainfall and 
snow) for North America, including the most recent years of observations, updates to observed datasets, the 
consideration of recent studies using CMIP5 and those using CMIP6 and CORDEX simulations. Assessment 
of changes in extremes are in Chapter 11 (Table 11.19–21) and climatic impact-drivers in Chapter 12 (Table 
12.8). 


## Atlas.9.1  Key features of the regional climate and findings from previous IPCC assessments 
 
### Atlas.9.1.1  Key features of the regional climate 
 
The recent-past climate of North America is characterized by high spatial heterogeneity and by variability at 
diverse temporal scales. Considering the traditional Köppen-Geiger classification, North America covers all 
main climate types (see reference region descriptions below). Important geographical features influence local 
climates over various distances, like the Rocky Mountains through cyclogenesis (Grise et al., 2013) and the 
Great Lakes through lake-effect snowfall (Wright et al., 2013). The cryosphere is an important component of 
the climate system in North America, with fundamental roles for sea ice cover, snow cover and permafrost. 
The ocean surrounding the continent also influence its climate, with water temperatures strongly influencing 
hurricane activity which impacts the coasts of eastern Mexico and south-eastern USA (Walsh et al., 2010). 
Temporal variability is influenced by several large-scale atmospheric modes (Annex IV, Table Atlas.1) with 
the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) affecting north-eastern USA and eastern Canada precipitation (Whan 
and Zwiers, 2017), and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) affecting temperature and precipitation in 
California, although in a complex and not yet fully understood manner (Yoon et al., 2015; Yeh et al., 2018).  
 
The reference regions defined for summarising North America climate change (Figure Atlas.26) include:  
North-Western North America (NWN), characterized by a subarctic climate with cool summers and rainfall 
all year round; North-Eastern North America (NEN), which also has a subarctic climate with sections of 
tundra climate in the far north (these two northern regions are also discussed in Section Atlas.11.2, Polar 
Arctic; Western North America (WNA), which has a complex but mainly cold semi-arid climate; the Central 
North America (CNA) with a mainly by continental climate in the northern part of the region and humid 
subtropical in the southern portion; Eastern North America (ENA) with a humid continental climate in the 
northern half and a humid subtropical climate to the south; Northern Central America (northern Mexico) 
(NCA), has a temperate climate to the north of the Tropic of Cancer, with marked differences between 
winter and summer, modulated by the North American monsoon (Peel et al., 2007). NCA, also covered in 
Section Atlas.7.1 Central America, has a temperate climate to the north of the Tropic of Cancer, with marked 
differences between winter and summer, modulated by the North American monsoon (Peel et al., 2007). 
 
 
### Atlas.9.1.2  Findings from previous IPCC assessments 
 
The IPCC AR5 (Bindoff et al., 2013; Hartmann et al., 2013) found that the climate of North America has 
changed due to anthropogenic causes (high confidence), in particular with primarily increasing annual 
precipitation and annual temperature (very high confidence). Assessment of CMIP5 ensemble projections 
concluded that mean annual temperature over North America and annual precipitation north of 45N will very 
likely continue to increase in the future. Also, CMIP5 projects increases in winter precipitation over Canada 
and Alaska and decreases in winter precipitation over the southwestern USA and much of Mexico.  
 
The CMIP5 multi-model ensemble generally reproduces the observed spatial patterns but somewhat 
underestimates the extent and intensity of the North American Monsoon, and also underestimates wetting 
over Central North America over the period of 1950–2012 during winter season according to AR5 (Flato et 
al., 2013). In the long-term (2081–2100), the largest changes of precipitation over North America are 
projected to occur in the mid and high latitudes and during winter (Kirtman et al., 2013).  
 
SR1.5 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018) reported a stronger warming compared to the global mean over Central 
and eastern North America, and a weakening of storm activity over North America under 1.5°C of global 
warming. SROCC (Hock et al., 2019b) reported that snow depth or mass is projected to decline by 25% 
mainly at lower elevations over the high mountains in Western North America. SRCCL (Mirzabaev et al., 
2019) observed vegetation greening in central North America with high confidence.  


## Atlas.9.2  Assessment and synthesis of observations, trends, and attribution 
 
The observed trends in annual mean surface temperature (see Figure Atlas.11 and the Interactive Atlas) 
across near-Arctic latitudes are exceptionally pronounced (>0.5°C per decade), significant and consistent 
across datasets except for far northeast Canada where trends are not significant in the CRU dataset. 
Significant positive trends are seen across the rest of North America during 1960–2015 (Figure Atlas.11) 
though over the shorter 1980–2015 period the regional dataset Daymet (Thornton et al., 2016) records non-
significant changes over southern Alaska, western and south-central Canada, and north-central USA 
(Interactive Atlas). An analysis of annual mean surface temperature in the Berkeley Earth dataset aggregated 
over the reference regions (Figure Atlas.11) demonstrates that a temperature change signal has emerged over 
all regions of North America. There is a detectable anthropogenic influence (medium confidence) on the 
observed upward annual temperature trends in western and northern North America (Vose et al., 2017; Wang 
et al., 2017b; Smith et al., 2018).  
 
Compared to temperature, trends in annual precipitation over 1960–2015 are generally non-significant 
though there are consistent positive trends over parts of ENA and CNA (Figure Atlas.11) and Daymet 
(Interactive Atlas) (high confidence). The global and regional datasets in Figure Atlas.11 and Interactive 
Atlas also indicate significant decreases in precipitation in parts of south-western US and north-western 
Mexico (see also Figure 2.15) though these are not all spatially coherent so there is only medium confidence 
in a drying trend over this region.  
 
Several factors account for the differences in temperature and precipitation trend significance. Observed 
trends in precipitation are relatively modest compared to the very large natural interannual variability of 
precipitation. Furthermore, the precipitation observing network is spatially inadequate (see Section 10.2.2.3) 
and temporally inconsistent (see Section 10.2.2.2) over some regions of North America, particularly over 
Arctic and mountainous areas. So detection of multidecadal trends is difficult, especially for regions with 
summertime convective precipitation maxima that may be spatially patchy (Easterling et al., 2017). See 
Section 2.3 for further discussion of precipitation trends. 
  
There is evidence of a recent decline in the overall North American annual maximum snow mass, with a 
trend for non-alpine regions above 40°N during 1980–2018 estimated from the bias-corrected GlobSnow 3.0 
data (Pulliainen et al., 2020) (medium confidence). This is despite technical challenges with in situ 
measurements and remote sensing retrievals of snow variables (Larue et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2017; Wang 
et al., 2017a; Zeng et al., 2018), spatial heterogeneity and interpolation assumptions that affect gridded 
reference products, notably over alpine and forested areas (Mudryk et al., 2015; Dozier et al., 2016; Cantet et 
al., 2019) and breaks in instruments and procedures (Kunkel et al., 2007; Mortimer et al., 2020). Changes in 
snow cover have evolved in a complex way, with both positive and negative trends and differing from one 
metric to another (Knowles, 2015; Brown et al., 2019). Evidence of large-area snow cover decline includes 
decreases in annual maximum snow depth and in snow water equivalent (Vincent et al., 2015; Kunkel et al., 
2016; Mote et al., 2018), as well as a shortening of the snow season duration (Knowles, 2015; Vincent et al., 
2015). However, reported snow decline trends are statistically significant only for a fraction of the concerned 
areas or locations (see Figure Atlas.25) (low confidence). See also Sections 2.3.2.2 and 9.5.3.1. 
 
Rupp et al. (2013) applied a standard finger-printing approach to CMIP5 models and determined that the 
decline in Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover extent could only be explained by simulations that 
included natural and anthropogenic forcing. In an attribution study focusing on direct physical causes, it was 
found that increased spring snowmelt in northern Canada was driven by warming-induced high latitudes 
changes such as atmospheric moisture, cloud cover, and energy advection (Mioduszewski et al., 2014).  
In an analysis of drivers of the record low snow water equivalent (SWE) values of spring 2015 in the western 
US, it was found that the relative importance of greenhouse gases varies spatially (Mote et al., 2016). See 
also Section 3.4.2 for further discussion of anthropogenic influences on snow extent.

## Atlas.9.3  Assessment of model performance 
 
CMIP6 models have been evaluated in the literature, although these studies have not included the full set of 
CMIP6 simulations. Fan et al. (2020) established on a continental basis for North America that temperature 
pattern correlations were quite accurate. Thorarinsdottir et al. (2020) compared maximum and minimum 
temperatures over Europe and North America with several observational datasets and found that the CMIP6 
ensemble agreed better with ERA5 data than did CMIP5. Srivastava et al. (2020) evaluated historical CMIP6 
simulations for precipitation, comparing them with several observational datasets over the continental US. 
Most models show a wet bias over the eastern half of continental USA and the northeast region while dry 
biases persist in the central part of the country (Akinsanola et al. (2020a) and Almazroui et al. (2021)). The 
spatial structure of biases is similar in CMIP5 and CMIP6, but with lower magnitudes in CMIP6. Agel and 
Barlow (2020) examined 16 CMIP6 models over the north-eastern US for precipitation and did not find a 
distinct improvement over CMIP5, although they did find the higher resolution models tended to perform 
better. On the basis of the evidence so far, there is medium confidence that CMIP6 models are improved 
compared to CMIP5 in terms of biases in mean temperature and precipitation over North America.  
 
North America has been extensively used as a testbed for regional climate model (RCM) experiments, such 
as the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) (Mearns et al., 2009), 
the MultiRCM Ensemble Downscaling (MRED) (Yoon et al., 2012), and NA-CORDEX (Bukovsky and 
Mearns, 2020). Therefore, much performance evaluation has been conducted with a focus on specific climate 
features in North America. For the North American monsoon region, multi-model performance evaluation 
(Bukovsky et al., 2013; Tripathi and Dominguez, 2013; Cerezo-Mota et al., 2015) or a single member 
performance (Lucas-Picher et al., 2013; Martynov et al., 2013; Šeparović et al., 2013) demonstrated the 
added value of RCMs, particularly more recent CORDEX simulations, through improved simulation of 
summertime precipitation and the climatological wintertime storm tracks across the western United States. 
NA-CORDEX simulations were more successful at reproducing weather types compared to a single model-
based large perturbed-physics ensemble (Prein et al., 2019). The application of a complex evaluation tool to 
the full suite of NA-CORDEX simulations found that the higher resolution simulations (25 km vs 50 km) of 
precipitation were improved, particularly for daily intensity (Gibson et al., 2019). 
 
However, deficiencies have also been reported. For example, storm occurrence over the East Coast of North 
America was found (Poan et al., 2018), and amplitude in the simulated annual cycle was generally excessive 
in NA-CORDEX simulations. RCMs tend to produce more (less) precipitation over mountains (the coastal 
plains) (Cerezo-Mota et al., 2015) and winter precipitation in the western US had large positive biases in all 
RegCM simulations, regardless of the driving GCM (Mahoney et al., 2021).  
 
Recently, convective-permitting RCMs have been used to simulate North American climate features and 
generated better simulations of precipitation. For example, summer precipitation over the south-western 
USA was improved due to better representation of organized mesoscale convective systems at the sub-daily 
scale (Castro et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2017; Prein et al., 2017b; Pal et al., 2019), the diurnal cycle of 
convection (Nesbitt et al., 2008), and in terms of means (and extremes) for the north-eastern United States 
(Komurcu et al., 2018). 
 
Recent studies have examined RCMs simulation of SWE, a quantity of primary importance notably for 
hydrological modelling though its ground measurements are restricted by relatively high time and monetary 
costs (Smith et al., 2017; Odry et al., 2020) which limit model assessment. Also, studies often emphasize that 
a false impression of model skill for SWE can be obtained by compensating temperature and precipitation 
biases. Assessment frameworks have dealt with these issues by considering observational uncertainty 
(Mccrary et al., 2017) and by decomposing SWE biases into their contributing processes (Rhoades et al., 
2018; Xu et al., 2019). SWE biases exceed observational uncertainty in several 50-km reanalysis-driven 
NARCCAP simulations over several regions, for all cold months (Mccrary et al., 2017). Analyses of NA-
CORDEX simulations show that refining spatial resolution from 50 to 12 km improves certain (but not all) 
aspects of SWE, stemming from improved mean precipitation and topography-related temperature (Xu et al., 
2019). Similarly an assessment of RCM simulations of freezing rain over Eastern Canada found a mix of 
improved and deteriorated aspects from higher resolution (St-Pierre et al., 2019). 
 
 
## Atlas.9.4  Assessment and synthesis of projections 
 
<figref>ATLAS.26</figref> 
 
CMIP5 and CMIP6 surface temperature and precipitation projections over the region are similar, with all 
regions warming more than the global average, most prominently those in the north most (Figure Atlas.26). 
CMIP6 projects, for scenarios and time-periods, higher temperature changes (see also Chapter 4) with this 
contrast more accentuated in the long-term future and at higher global warming levels. The higher warming 
in the north (also see the Interactive Atlas) is clear when comparing NEN, with increases from 2.5°C to over 
11°C on an annual basis for SSP5-8.5 (near-term to long-term compared to a 1995–2014 baseline), to NCA, 
where changes range from 1.5°C to 6°C across the same periods. Maps showing changes in temperature and 
precipitation, and their robustness, are available in the Interactive Atlas. The number of model results (i.e., 
ensemble size used to generate these figures) differs, and this sample size difference may affect the results, 
but the patterns and magnitudes of change are generally consistent and thus it is very likely that temperatures 
will increase throughout the 21st century in all land areas, with stronger warming in the far north.  
 
CMIP5 results have been analysed extensively (e.g., Maloney et al., 2014) and used in major climate change 
assessments. The most recent US National Climate Assessment analysis of CMIP5 focusing on RCP4.5 and 
RCP8.5 for two future time periods stated that the USA would continue to warm regardless of scenario but is 
likely to be higher with higher emissions scenarios (e.g., RCP8.5). Projected changes in precipitation are 
somewhat complex, but increased precipitation dominates in winter and spring, whereas in summer changes 
are more variable and uncertain. Canada’s Changing Climate Report (Bush and Lemmen, 2019) presents 
changes in temperature and precipitation, as well as other variables, such as snow, for future periods in 
Canada using results from CMIP5. It indicates that annual and winter precipitation is projected to increase 
everywhere in Canada over the 21st century with larger percentage increases in the north. Temperature is 
also projected to increase, regardless of scenario, and with larger changes occurring in the north.  
 
To provide the basis for generating additional information compared to that derived from CMIP5 the NA-
CORDEX experiments were designed to involve a GCM-RCM matrix which included multiple GCMs that 
sampled the full range of climate sensitivity, multiple RCMs, at two different spatial resolutions (25 and 50 
km) and a range of emissions scenarios (in most cases RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) (Mearns et al., 2017). 
Karmalkar (2018) noted that the NA-CORDEX model covers subregional ranges of temperature change 
from the CMIP5 GCMs better than NARCCAP did for the CMIP3 models. This structural design shift 
provides greater confidence in the NA-CORDEX results in terms of sampling the uncertainty across the 
CMIP5 models (Figure Atlas.27) (Bukovsky and Mearns, 2020). The pattern of warming is as seen in 
CMIP5 and CMIP6 which also builds confidence that the RCMs generate high-resolution results consistent 
with CMIP5 on large scales whilst providing added value over regions such as the complex topography of 
the Rocky Mountains in the US West, which are not well resolved in the GCMs. There is high confidence 
that downscaling a subset of CMIP models that spans the range of climate sensitivities in the full ensemble is 
critical for producing a representative range of dynamically downscaled projections. 
 
<figref>ATLAS.27</figref> 
 
There are striking contrasts in the seasonal results for precipitation for the subregions (Figure Atlas.26). The 
northern regions and ENA all show steady increases with the global warming levels (very high confidence). 
For example, the projected increases in NEN region range from 7% in the near term to 40% at the end of the 
21st century for the SSP5-8.5 scenario. In contrast, projected changes for NCA are for significant decreases 
both on an annual basis (Interactive Atlas) and in winter and which become greater as warming increases 
(Akinsanola et al., 2020b; Almazroui et al., 2021). The other two regions (WNA and CNA) exhibit mainly 
increases in winter. In summer, distributions are in general less uniform except for NWN and NEN which 
display steady increases with global warming levels (but smaller than in winter). WNA and CNA mainly 
show decreases (based on the median values) but with some models projecting increases. Projections from 
the NA-CORDEX ensemble are consistent with those from the GCMs whilst providing greater detail of 
precipitation changes over the mountains and along the coasts (Bukovsky and Mearns, 2020)(Interactive 
Atlas). Similar results are found in other analyses of RCM projections (Wang and Kotamarthi, 2015; Ashfaq 
et al., 2016; Teichmann et al., 2020). Also, further analysis of the NA-CORDEX projections showed 
substantial changes in weather types related to increased monsoonal flow frequency and drying of the 
northern Great Plains in summer (Prein et al., 2019). 
 
In summary, NEN, NWN and most of ENA will very likely experience increased annual mean precipitation, 
with greater increases at higher levels of warming (very high confidence). In NCA decreases predominate on 
an annual basis and particularly in winter (high confidence). Projected changes in summer are highly 
uncertain throughout other regions apart from the far northern parts of NEN and NWN which will likely 
experience increases (high confidence).  
 
As discussed in Section 10.3.3.4 an important advance in regional modelling over the past decade or so is the 
use of convection-permitting regional models (CPMs) (Prein et al., 2015, 2017b). There have been a number 
of experiments using CPMs over North America (e.g., Rasmussen et al., 2014; Prein et al., 2015, 2019; Liu 
et al., 2017; Komurcu et al., 2018). A CPM study over North America that investigated changes in 
Mesoscale Convective Systems projected that by the end of the century, assuming an RCP8.5 scenario, their 
frequency more than tripled and associated precipitation increased by 80% (Prein et al., 2017a). A multiple 
nesting of WRF over north-eastern US downscaling to 3 km a CESM GCM climate projection assuming an 
RCP8.5 scenario, found a different pattern of precipitation change of mixed increases and decreases 
compared to the GCM projection of increases every month (Komurcu et al., 2018). These investigations 
demonstrate the potential of very high-resolution simulations to add important dimensions to our 
understanding of regional climate change, though not necessarily to reduce uncertainty (high confidence). 
 
It is virtually certain that snow cover will experience a general decline across North America during the 21st 
century, in terms of extent, annual duration and SWE, based on CMIP5 (Maloney et al., 2014), CMIP6 
(Mudryk et al., 2020), NA-CORDEX (Mahoney et al., 2021) and NARCCAP (e.g., McCrary and Mearns, 
2019) simulations. For some regions the decline could be discernible over the next few decades, for example 
in western USA (Fyfe et al., 2017). It is, however, likely that some high-latitude regions will rather 
experience an increase in certain winter snow cover properties (Mudryk et al., 2018; McCrary and Mearns, 
2019), due to snowfall increase (Krasting et al., 2013a) prevailing over the warming effect. Discussion of 
changes in snow in the future is also covered in Section 9.5.3, but for larger regions.  
 
The fraction of precipitation falling as snow is projected to decrease practically everywhere over North 
America, including over western USA and south-western Canada (Mahoney et al., 2021), and in the Great 
Lakes basin where lake-effect precipitation is important (Suriano and Leathers, 2016). In this basin, the 
frequency of heavy lake-effect snowstorms is expected to decrease during the 21st century, except for a 
possible temporary increase around Lake Superior by mid-century, if local air temperatures remain low 
enough (Notaro et al., 2015). CMIP5 simulations of the periods 1981–2000 and 2081–2100 over central and 
eastern US suggest a northward shift in the transition zone between rain-dominated and snow-dominated 
areas, by about 2° latitude under the RCP4.5 scenario and 4° latitude under the RCP8.5 scenario (Ning and 
Bradley, 2015). Rain-on-snow event properties over North America should also evolve during the 21st 
century, with non-trivial dependencies on the positioning relative to the freezing line (Jeong and Sushama, 
2018) and on elevation (Musselman et al., 2018). 
 
 
## Atlas.9.5  Summary 
 
Across North America it is very likely that positive surface temperature trends are persistent. Across near-
Arctic latitudes of North America increases are exceptionally pronounced, greater than 0.5°C per decade 
(high confidence). In parts of eastern and central North America it is likely that annual precipitation has 
increased over the period of 1960 to 2015 but with no clear trends in other regions except for parts of south-
western US and north-western Mexico where there is medium confidence in drying.  
 
Model representation of the climatology of mean temperature and precipitation has likely improved 
compared to the AR5 over North America. This is aided by continuous model development, and the 
existence of new coordinated modelling initiatives such as NA-CORDEX. There is high confidence that 
downscaling a subset of CMIP models that spans the range of climate sensitivities in the full ensemble is 
critical for producing a representative range of dynamically downscaled projections. 
 
It is virtually certain that annual and seasonal surface temperatures over all of North America will continue 
to increase at a rate greater than the global average, with greater increases in the far north. It is very likely, 
based on global and regional model future projections, that on an annual time scale precipitation will 
increase over most of North America north of about 45°N and in eastern North America, and it is likely that 
it will decrease in the southwest US and northern Mexico, particularly in winter. Elsewhere the direction of 
change of precipitation is uncertain. It is virtually certain that snow cover will experience a decline over 
most regions of North America during the 21st century, in terms of water equivalent, extent and annual 
duration. It is however very likely that some high-latitude regions will rather experience an increase in winter 
snow water equivalent, due to the snowfall increase prevailing over the warming effect.  


# Atlas.10  Small islands 
 
## Atlas.10.1  Key features of the regional climate and findings from previous IPCC assessments 
 
### Atlas.10.1.1 Key features of the regional climate 
 
Many small islands lie in tropical regions and their climate varies depending on a range of factors with 
location, extent and topography having major influences. In general, their climate is determined by that of 
the broader region in which they lie as they have little influence on the regional climate although steep 
topography can induce higher rainfall totals locally. Temperature variability tends to be low due to the 
influence of the surrounding ocean, most marked in the tropics where oceanic temperature ranges are small. 
However, seasonal rainfall variability can often be significant, both through the annual cycle and also 
interannually through the influence of many modes of variability (for more details see Cross-Chapter Box 
Atlas.2:, Annex IV and Section Atlas.7.1 for the Caribbean). Many small islands are exposed to tropical 
cyclones and the associated hazards of high winds, storm surges and extreme rainfall, and many low-lying 
islands are exposed to regular flooding from natural high tide and wave activity. In the Pacific, phases of the 
El Niño Southern Oscillation result in periods of warmer or cooler than average temperatures following the 
upper ocean warming of El Niño events or cooling of La Niña events, and respectively weaker and stronger 
trade winds. El Niño conditions also lead to drought in Melanesian islands and increased typhoons and storm 
surges in French Polynesia with La Niña conditions causing drought in Kiribati. Other islands experience 
increased rainfall during these periods. 
 
 
### Atlas.10.1.2 Findings from previous IPCC assessments 
 
The AR5 noted observed temperature increases of 0.1°C–0.2°C per decade in Pacific Islands and that 
warming was very likely to continue across all Small Island regions (Christensen et al., 2013; IPCC, 2013a). 
It also reported decreased rainfall over the Caribbean, increases over the Seychelles, streamflow reductions 
over the Hawaiian Islands and projections of reduced rainfall over the Caribbean and drier rainy season for 
many of the southwest Pacific Islands (Christensen et al., 2013; IPCC, 2013a; Nurse et al., 2014). The 
remaining findings are derived from the SROCC (IPCC, 2019a). Ocean warming rates have likely increased 
in recent decades with marine heatwaves increasing and very likely to have become longer-lasting, more 
intense and extensive as a result of anthropogenic warming. Open ocean oxygen levels have very likely 
decreased and oxygen minimum zones have likely increased in extent. There is very high confidence that 
global mean sea level rise has accelerated in recent decades which, combined with increases in tropical 
cyclone winds and rainfall and increases in extreme waves, has exacerbated extreme sea level events and 
coastal hazards (high confidence). It is virtually certain that during the 21st century, the ocean will transition 
to unprecedented conditions with further warming and acidification virtually certain, increased upper ocean 
stratification very likely and continued oxygen decline (medium confidence). There is very high confidence 
that marine heatwaves and medium confidence that extreme El Niño and La Niña events will become more 
frequent. It is very likely that these changes will be smaller under scenarios with low greenhouse-gas 
emissions. Global mean sea level will continue to rise and there is high confidence that the consequent 
increases in extreme levels will result in local sea levels in most locations that historically occurred once per 
century occurring at least annually by the end of the century under all RCP scenarios (high confidence). In 
particular, many small islands are projected to experience historical centennial events at least annually by 
2050 under RCP2.6 and higher emissions. The proportion of Category 4 and 5 tropical cyclones, and 
associated precipitation rates and storm surges, along with average tropical cyclone intensity are projected to 
increase with a 2°C global temperature rise, thereby exacerbating coastal hazards. 
 
 
## Atlas.10.2  Assessment and synthesis of observations, trends and attribution 
 
Significant positive trends in temperature ranging from 0.15°C per decade (over the period 1953–2010) to 
0.18°C per decade (over the period 1961–2011) are noted in the tropical Western Pacific, where the 
significant increasing trends in the warm and cool extremes are also spatially homogeneous (Jones et al., 
2013; Whan et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016). Similarly, much of the Caribbean region showed statistically 
significant warming (at the 95% level) over the 1901–2010 period (Jones et al., 2016b). Observation records 
in the Caribbean region indicate a significant warming trend of 0.19°C per decade and 0.28°C per decade in 
daily maximum and minimum temperatures, respectively, with statistically significant increases (at the 5% 
level) in the number of warm days and warm nights during 1961–2010 (Taylor et al., 2012b; Stephenson et 
al., 2014; Beharry et al., 2015). 
 
A weather station-based annual precipitation trend analysis over 1901–2010 in the Caribbean region 
indicated some locations with detectable decreasing trends (Knutson and Zeng, 2018), which were 
attributable in part to anthropogenic forcing. These include southern Cuba, the northern Bahamas, and the 
Windward Islands although significant trends were not found over the shorter periods of 1951–2010 and 
1981–2010. In Caribbean Islands, a Palmer Drought Severity Index dataset from 1950 to 2016 showed a 
clear drying trend in the region (Herrera and Ault, 2017). The 2013–2016 period showed the most severe 
drought during the period and was strongly related to anthropogenic warming, which would have increased 
the severity of the event by 17% and its spatial extent by 7% (Herrera et al., 2018). However, a seasonal 
analysis of observations grouped into large subregions of the Caribbean revealed no significant long-term 
trends in rainfall over 1901–2012 but significant inter-decadal variability (Jones et al., 2016b). Declines in 
summer rainfall (–4.4% per decade) and maximum five-day rainfall (–32.6 mm per decade) over 1960–2005 
were reported for Jamaica (CSGM, 2012) and an insignificant decrease in summer precipitation was 
observed for Cuba for 1960 to 1995 (Naranjo-Diaz and Centella, 1998). Three of four stations examined for 
Puerto Rico exhibited declining JJA rainfall over 1955–2009 with the trend statistically significant at the 
95% level for Canóvana (Méndez-Lázaro et al., 2014). In the Caribbean, positive regional trends in 
precipitation of 2% and trends in extremes during 1961 to 2010 were found to be not statistically significant 
(at the 5% level) (Stephenson et al., 2014; Beharry et al., 2015). Positive trends in JJA rainfall over Cuba and 
Jamaica are seen in the CRU, whereas they are negative over Cuba for GPCC; over eastern Hispaniola they 
are positive in CRU and negative in CHIRPS (Cavazos et al., 2020).  
 
In Hawai’i, between 1920 and 2012, over 90% of the islands showed reduced rainfall and streamflow, an 
increase in the frequency of days with zero flow (Strauch et al., 2015; Frazier and Giambelluca, 2017) and 
robust positive trends in the drought frequency and severity (McGree et al., 2016). Over the western Pacific, 
interannual and decadal variabilities also drive long-term trends in rainfall. Recent analysis of station data 
showed spatial variations in the mostly decreasing but non-significant trends in annual and extreme rainfall 
over the Western Pacific from 1961–2011 (low confidence) (McGree et al., 2014). Over the southern 
subtropical Pacific decreases in annual, JJA, SON and extreme rainfall and increasing drought frequency in 
western region has been observed since 1951 (Jovanovic et al., 2012; McGree et al., 2016, 2019). 
 
Over the Western Indian Ocean significant warming trends have been reported for Mauritius (1.2°C during 
1951–2016 (MESDDBM, 2016)), La Réunion (0.18°C per decade over 1968–2019 (Météo-France, 2020)) 
and Maldives (MEE, 2016). Both Mauritius and La Réunion have experienced rainfall decreases of 8% 
during 1951–2016 and 1.2% per decade during 1961–2019 with generally weak, non-significant rainfall 
trends during 1967–2012.  
 
Assessing observed climate change for Small Islands is often constrained by low station density (Ryu and 
Hayhoe, 2014; Jones et al., 2016c), digitization requirements or data sharing limitations (Jones et al., 2016c). 
Station data typically have longer temporal coverage relative to satellite products but are limited in spatial 
coverage (Cavazos et al., 2020). For Small Island nations, spatial gaps between observations can be very 
large due to isolation of the islands (Wright et al., 2016). Additionally over past decades, the number of 
station observations has declined substantially in Mauritius (Dhurmea et al., 2019), Hawai‘i (Bassiouni and 
Oki, 2013; Frazier and Giambelluca, 2017) and most Pacific Island countries since the 1980s (Jones et al., 
2013; McGree et al., 2014, 2016). In Fiji, meteorological stations were located on or by the coast and sparse 
in the interior (Kumar et al., 2013). Notable topography and land use may result in changes in climatic 
conditions over small distances (Foley, 2018), making the observational density particularly relevant.  
 
Moreover, many stations have little metadata available, including those in Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands and 
Papua New Guinea (Whan et al., 2014). Compared to earlier decades, little metadata are currently being 
documented in the western Pacific islands (McGree et al., 2014), which will challenge the homogenization of 
long-term observational records. Challenges in the Caribbean include maintaining continuous daily time 
series with metadata, converting climatological data into digital formats and making them freely available 
(Stephenson et al., 2014; Beharry et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2016c). This is also an issue in the Pacific as 
many data are kept in national (local) databases, with only a fraction having been incorporated into global 
datasets (Whan et al., 2014).  
 
Because of the small number of stations used for interpolation and the complex mountainous topography, 
gridded product for these small islands should be interpreted with caution (Frazier and Giambelluca, 2017). 
For the Antilles, the error in estimating CRU2.0 monthly precipitation can stand locally between 20% and 
40%. Over the Caribbean, (Cavazos et al., 2020) found a discrepancy across gridded observational datasets 
(CRU, CHIRPS, and GPCP) in detecting orographic precipitation especially during boreal summer making 
their use in climate model evaluation challenging (Herrera and Ault, 2017). Furthermore, some reanalysis 
products such as the 0.7° x 0.7° ERA-Interim reanalysis are not adequate as many of the smaller Caribbean 
islands are not represented as land (Jones et al., 2016c).  
 
 
## Atlas.10.3  Assessment of model performance 
 
An assessment of model performance for the Caribbean region is contained in Section Atlas.7.1 on Central 
America. In summary, the ability of climate models to simulate the climate over the region has improved in 
many key respects with the application of increased model resolution and a better representation of the land-
surface processes of particular importance in these advances (high confidence). Regional climate models 
(RCMs) simulate realistically seasonal surface temperature and precipitation patterns including the bimodal 
rainfall in the precipitation annual cycle although with some timing biases in some regions (high confidence). 
The important regional circulation and precipitation features, the Caribbean Low-Level Jet and the mid-
summer drought, are well represented over a variety of RCM domains covering the region (high confidence).  
 
Over the tropical Pacific, surface temperature biases in CMIP6 models remain similar to those in CMIP5, 
although are reduced in the higher resolution models in the HiResMIP ensemble. CMIP6 models generally 
represents trends in sea surface temperatures better than CMIP5 (see Section 9.2.1 for more details). For 
precipitation, the persistent tropical Pacific bias of the double ITCZ (erronious bands of excessive rainfall 
both sides of the equatorial Pacific) is still present in CMIP6 models although is slightly improved compared 
to those in CMIP3 and CMIP5 models (Section 3.3.2.2). Application of downscaling techniques (RCMs and 
stretched-grid GCMs) using resolutions finer than 10 km over the Pacific can capture topographic influences 
on wind and rainfall to generate realistic simulations of island climates – for example over Fiji and New 
Caledonia, (Chattopadhyay and Katzfey, 2015; Dutheil et al., 2019). In both cases applying bias adjustment 
to the sea surface temperatures used as a lower boundary condition for the downscaling models was 
important to generate realistic simulations. 
 
 
## Atlas.10.4  Assessment and synthesis of projections 
 
Projected median temperature increases for Small Islands from the CMIP5 ensemble range from 1°C 
(RCP4.5) to 1.5°C (RCP8.5) in the period 2046–2065, and from 1.3°C (RCP4.5) to 2.8°C (RCP8.5) by 
2081–2100 relative to 1986–2005 (Harter et al., 2015). Spatial variations in the warming trend are projected 
to increase by the end of the 21st century, with relatively higher increases in the Arctic and sub-Arctic 
islands, and in the equatorial regions compared with islands in the Southern Ocean (Harter et al., 2015). In 
the western Pacific, temperatures are projected to increase by 2.0°C to 4.5°C by the end of the 21st century 
relative to 1961–1990 (Wang et al., 2016). The warming over land in the Lesser Antilles is estimated to be 
about 1.6°C (3.0°C) by 2071–2100 for the RCP4.5 (RCP8.5) scenario, relative to 1971–2000 (Cantet et al., 
2014). Projections from the CMIP6 ensemble support these findings (Figure Atlas.28) and across global 
warming levels from 1.5°C to 4°C CMIP5 and CMIP6 consistently project lower levels of warming for 
Small Islands than the global average (see also the Interactive Atlas).  

<figref>ATLAS.28</figref> 
 
The CMIP5 ensemble median projected a precipitation decreases of up to –16% over the Caribbean, parts of 
the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and southern sub-tropical and eastern Pacific Ocean, and increases of up to 
10% over parts of the western Pacific and Southern Ocean, and up to 55% in the equatorial Pacific islands 
under RCP6.0 in the period 2081–2100 relative to 1986–2005 (Harter et al., 2015). A projected decrease in 
annual precipitation is also noted over the Lesser Antilles under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios (Cantet et 
al., 2014). Seasonal rainfall is projected to decrease in most areas in Hawai’i, except for the climatically wet 
windward side of the mountains, which would increase the wet and dry gradient over the area (Timm et al., 
2015). The average precipitation changes in Hawai’i are estimated to be about –11% to –28% under RCP4.5 
during the wet season, and about –4% to –28% under RCP4.5 during the dry season in the period 2041–2071 
relative to 1975–2005, with larger changes under RCP8.5 (Timm et al., 2015). There are still uncertainties in 
the projected changes, which have been attributed to factors including insufficient model skill in representing 
topography in the small islands, and high variability in climate drivers. However, the broad-scale pattern of 
projected wetter conditions in the western and equatorial Pacific, North Indian and Southern Oceans and of 
drier conditions over the Caribbean, parts of the Atlantic, West Indian and the southern sub-tropical and 
eastern Pacific Oceans are further strengthened in the CMIP6 ensemble (Figure Atlas.28) which are thus 
likely regional responses as the climate continues to warm. 
 
The negative trend in future summer rainfall in the Caribbean and Central America is projected to be 
strongest during the mid-summer (June–August) based on studies using GCMs (Rauscher et al., 2008; 
Karmalkar et al., 2013; Karmacharya et al., 2017; Taylor et al., 2018). The future summer drying over the 
Caribbean is associated with a projected future strengthening of the Caribbean Low-Level Jet (Taylor et al., 
2013b). Rauscher et al. (2008) hypothesized that the simulated 21st century drying over Central America 
represents an early onset and intensification of the mid-summer drought. The westward expansion and 
intensification of the NASH associated with the mid-summer drought occurs earlier under A1B, with 
stronger low-level easterlies. Rauscher et al. (2008) further suggested that the eastern Pacific ITCZ is also 
located further southward and that there are some indications that these changes could be forced by ENSO-
like warming of the tropical eastern Pacific and increased land-ocean heating contrasts over the North 
American continent. Other studies also suggest a future intensification of the NASH due to changes in land-
sea temperature contrast resulting from increased greenhouse-gas concentrations (Li et al., 2012b). 

## Atlas.10.5  Summary 
 
It is very likely that all Small Island regions have warmed with significant trends recorded from at least the 
1960s in all territories or nations. Trends include 0.15°C–0.18°C per decade in the tropical Western Pacific 
(1953 to 2011), significant warming over the Caribbean (1901–2010) with trends of 0.19°C (0.28°C) per 
decade in daily maximum (minimum temperatures) (1961–2010) and in La Réunion of 0.18°C per decade 
(1968–2019). There are fewer significant trends in precipitation in these regions though several locations in 
the Caribbean have detectable decreasing trends (high confidence), in part attributable to anthropogenic 
forcing (limited evidence). Also, it is likely that drying has occurred since the mid-20th century in some parts 
of the Western Indian Ocean, and in the Pacific poleward of 20° latitude in both the northern and southern 
hemispheres. 
 
It is very likely that Small Island regions will continue to warm in the coming decades at a level slightly 
lower than the global mean. Small Island regions in the Western and equatorial Pacific, North Indian and 
Southern Ocean are likely to be wetter in the future and those in the Caribbean, parts of the Atlantic and 
West Indian Oceans and the southern sub-tropical and eastern Pacific Ocean drier.

# Atlas.11  Polar regions 
 
The assessment in this section focuses on changes in average temperature, precipitation (rainfall and snow) 
and surface mass balance over the polar regions, Antarctica and the Arctic, including the most recent years 
of observations, updates to observed datasets, the consideration of recent studies using CMIP5 simulations 
and those using CMIP6 and CORDEX simulations. Findings are presented for West Antarctica (WAN), East 
Antarctica (EAN) and three Arctic regions, Arctic Ocean (ARO), Greenland/Iceland (GIC) and Russian 
Arctic (RAR) (Figure Atlas.29) with some reference also to North-Eastern North America (NEN), North-
Western North America (NWN) and Northern Europe (NEU), which are covered more extensively in 
Sections Atlas.9 and Atlas.8 respectively. Subregional changes are discussed when relevant, for example the 
Antarctic Peninsula (AP) as a subregion of WAN. The Southern Ocean (SOO) region is assessed in Chapter 
9 with changes in climatic impact-drivers assessed in Chapter 12 (12.4.9, Table 12.11) and some extremes in 
Chapter 11 (Table 11.7–9 for RAR). Chapter 9 provides an overall assessment of the ice sheet processes and 
changes, as part of the cryosphere, ocean and sea level change assessment.

## Atlas.11.1  Antarctica 
 
### Atlas.11.1.1 Key features of the regional climate and findings from previous IPCC assessments 
 
#### Atlas.11.1.1.1  Key features of the regional climate 
The Antarctic region, covered by an ice sheet and surrounded by the Southern Ocean, is characterized by 
polar climate. It is the coldest, windiest and driest continent on Earth and plays a pivotal role in regulating 
the global climate and hydrological cycle. Antarctica has a mean temperature of –35°C (Lenaerts et al., 
2016) and receives 171 mm yr–1 water equivalent of snowfall (north of 82°S, estimate based on satellite 
measurements during 2006–2011) (Palerme et al., 2014). Precipitation in Antarctica occurs mostly in the 
form of snowfall and diamond dust, with sporadic coastal rainfall during the summer over the Antarctic 
Peninsula and sub-Antarctic islands. Drizzle events sometimes occur during warm air intrusions (Nicolas et 
al., 2017) at relatively low temperatures (Silber et al., 2019). Precipitation constitutes the largest component 
of the surface mass balance (SMB), which also includes sublimation (from the surface or drifting snow), 
meltwater runoff and redistribution by wind (Lenaerts et al., 2019). SMB can be considered as a proxy of 
precipitation if averaged over an annual cycle (Gorodetskaya et al., 2015; Bracegirdle et al., 2019). 
Precipitation and SMB exhibit spatial and temporal variability controlled by atmospheric large-scale low-
pressure systems and moisture advection from lower latitudes. SMB is an important component of the total 
ice-sheet mass balance (Section 9.4.2.1). The Antarctic contribution to sea level results from the imbalance 
between net snow accumulation and ice discharge into the ocean (Box 9.1). Ice shelves buttress the ice sheet 
and are influenced by oceanic and atmospheric drivers (Box 9.1). 
 
Antarctic climate variability is influenced by the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and regionally by other 
modes, including ENSO, Pacific-South American Pattern, Pacific Decadal Variability, Indian Ocean Dipole 
and Zonal Wave 3 (Annex IV). Climate change in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean is influenced by 
interactions between the ice sheet, ocean, sea ice, and atmosphere (Meredith et al., 2019) (Sections 9.2.3.2, 
9.3.2 and 9.4.2). In addition to Chapter 9, Antarctica is discussed across the report: global climate links 
(Chapters 2 and 10), attribution (Chapter 3), global water cycle (Chapter 8), extremes (Chapter 11), and 
climatic impact-drivers (Chapter 12).  
 
 
#### Atlas.11.1.1.2  Findings from previous IPCC assessments 
AR5 (Vaughan et al., 2013) reported warming over Antarctica since 1950s, mostly over AP and WAN, 
attributed to the positive trend in the SAM. These trends in the Antarctic temperature were given low 
confidence due to substantial multi-annual to multi-decadal variability, as well as uncertainties in magnitude 
and spatial trend structure. AR5 reported low confidence that anthropogenic forcing has contributed to the 
temperature change in Antarctica. AR5 highlighted a large interannual variability in snow accumulation with 
no significant trend since 1979 around Antarctica, and high confidence in the overall mass loss from 
Antarctica, accelerated since 1990s.  
 
In this and the following paragraphs findings are from SROCC (Meredith et al., 2019) unless otherwise 
stated. Warming trends were reported over parts of WAN with record surface warmth over WAN during the 
1990s compared to the past 200 years, and AP surface melting intensifying since the mid-20th century. No 
significant temperature trends were reported over EAN and there was low confidence in both WAN and EAN 
trend estimates due to sparse in situ records and large interannual to interdecadal variability. In the AP, 
concomitant increase in temperature and foehn winds due to positive SAM caused increased surface melting 
over the Larsen ice shelves (medium confidence). Strong warming between the mid-1950s and the late 1990s 
led to the collapse of the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002, which had been intact for the 11,000 years (medium 
confidence). 
 
Snowfall increased over the Antarctic ice sheet over AP and WAN, offsetting some of the 20th century sea 
level rise (medium confidence). Longer records suggest either a decrease in snowfall over the Antarctic ice 
sheet over the last 1000 years or a statistically negligible change over the last 800 years (low confidence). 
 
Recent warming in the AP and consequent ice-shelf collapse are likely linked to anthropogenic ozone and 
greenhouse-gas forcing via the SAM and anthropogenically-driven Atlantic sea surface. Also, there is high 
confidence in the influence of tropical sea surface temperature on the Antarctic temperature and Southern 
Hemisphere mid-latitude circulation, as well as the SAM. There is medium agreement but limited evidence 
of an anthropogenic forcing effect on Antarctic ice-sheet mass balance (low confidence) and partitioning 
between natural and human drivers of atmospheric and ocean circulation changes remains very uncertain. 
 
In AR5 Church et al. (2013) gave medium confidence in model projections of a future Antarctic SMB 
increase, implying a negative contribution to global mean sea level rise, consistent with a projection of 
significant Antarctic warming. Church et al. (2013) also gave high confidence to the relationship between 
future temperature and precipitation increases in Antarctica on physical grounds and from ice core evidence. 
In Meredith et al. (2019), the total mass balance projections derived from ice sheet models were reported 
without separating the SMB though projections were reported of increased precipitation and continued 
strengthening of the westerly winds in the Southern Ocean. 
 
 
### Atlas.11.1.2 Assessment and synthesis of observations, trends and attribution 
 
Figure Atlas.30 (Antarctic map inset) shows near surface air temperature trends for 1957-2016 and 1979-
2016 at the stations where observations are available for at least 50 years and the detected trends have 
statistical significance of at least 90% according to the most recent (after SROCC) studies (Jones et al., 2019; 
Turner et al., 2020). It is very likely that the western and northern AP has been warming significantly since 
1950s (0.49 ± 0.28°C per decade during 1957–2016 and 0.46 ± 0.15°C during 1951–2018 at Faraday-
Vernadsky station; 0.29 ± 0.16°C per decade during 1957–2016 at Esperanza station), with no significant 
trends reported in the eastern AP during the same period (Gonzalez and Fortuny, 2018; Jones et al., 2019; 
Turner et al., 2020). Short-term cooling trends, strongest during austral summer, have been reported at AP 
stations during 1999–2016 but the absence of warming and cooling at some stations during 1999–2016 is 
consistent with natural variability and there is no evidence of a shift in the overall warming trend observed 
since 1950s (Turner et al., 2016, 2020; Gonzalez and Fortuny, 2018; Jones et al., 2019; Bozkurt et al., 2020).  

Significant warming at the Byrd station (0.29 ± 0.19°C per decade during 1957–2016) confirms and extends 
earlier trend estimates (0.42 ± 0.24°C per decade during 1958–2010) and is representative of the entire WAN 
warming (0.22 ± 0.12°C per decade from 1958 to 2012 averaged over WAN excluding AP, medium 
confidence due to lack of observations) (Bromwich et al., 2013, 2014; Jones et al., 2019). WAN and AP 
show statistically significant warming in the HadCRUTv5 observational dataset (Figure 2.11b). There is a 
high confidence in the long-term warming trend at the AP and WAN also at the century scale based on 
reconstructions (Zagorodnov et al., 2012; Stenni et al., 2017; Lyu et al., 2020) confirming the trends 
estimated by earlier studies assessed in the SROCC (Meredith et al., 2019). The century-scale warming trend 
in the AP is very likely an emerging signal compared to natural variability, while the WAN warming trend 
falls in the high end of century-scale trends over the last 2000 years (Stenni et al., 2017) (medium 
confidence).  
 
In EAN, during 1957-2016, three stations showed significant warming (Scott base 0.22 ± 0.15, 
Novolazarevskaya 0.13 ± 0.09 and Vostok  0.15 ± 0.13°C per decade), while other stations with long-term 
observations indicated no statistically significant trends (Figure Atlas.30). During 1979-2016, three coastal 
stations showed cooling, while at South Pole a warming trend was detected, increasing  to 0.61±0.34 °C per 
decade during 1989-2018) (Jones et al., 2019; Clem et al., 2020; Turner et al., 2020) (Figure Atlas.30).  The 
century-scale warming in Queen Maud Land Coast based on the ice-core reconstructions is within the range 
of centennial internal variability (Stenni et al., 2017).  
 
While a trend towards a positive phase of the SAM since the 1970s likely explains a significant part of the 
warming at the northern AP, it had a cooling effect on the continental WAN and EAN (particularly strong in 
DJF, Table.Atlas.1). Warming in western AP and over WAN during 1957–2016 (Figure.Atlas.30) and 
through to 2020 (Figure 2.11) is likely due to significant contribution of other factors, such as tropical Pacific 
forcing through PDV, ENSO, Amundsen Sea Low position/strength and also anthropogenic climate change 
(Jones et al., 2019; Scott et al., 2019; Wille et al., 2019; Donat-Magnin et al., 2020; Turner et al., 2020). 
Since SROCC, new studies confirmed the influence of foehn wind and cloud radiative forcing on Larsen C 
surface melt (Elvidge et al., 2020; Gilbert et al., 2020; Turton et al., 2020). In the WAN, summer surface-
melt occurrence over ice shelves may have increased since the late 2000s (Scott et al., 2019). It is likely that 
increased meltwater ponding and resulting hydrofracturing have been important mechanisms of the rapid 
disintegration of the Larsen B ice shelf (Banwell et al., 2013; MacAyeal and Sergienko, 2013; Robel and 
Banwell, 2019). Ice shelf disintegration and relevant processes are discussed in Sections 9.4.2.1 and 9.4.2.3. 
 
Direct observations of snowfall in Antarctica using traditional gauges are highly uncertain and records from 
precipitation radars (Gorodetskaya et al., 2015; Grazioli et al., 2017; Scarchilli et al., 2020) are not long 
enough to assess trends. Estimates of precipitation and SMB are largely model-based due to the paucity of in 
situ observations in Antarctica (Lenaerts et al., 2019; Hanna et al., 2020). Antarctic SMB is dominated by 
precipitation and removal by sublimation with very small amounts of melt mostly important only on the ice 
shelves. Climate models and satellite records (IMBIE team et al., 2018; Rignot et al., 2019; Mottram et al., 
2021) suggest that strong interannual variability of Antarctic-wide SMB over the satellite period currently 
masks any existing trend (Figure Atlas.30) in spite of a possible ozone depletion-related precipitation 
increase over the 1991–2005 period (Lenaerts et al., 2018). No significant Antarctic-wide SMB trend 
continent-wide SMB trend is inferred since 1979 (IMBIE team et al., 2018; Medley and Thomas, 2019). 
While ice core reconstructions show a significant increase in the western AP SMB since 1950s (Thomas et 
al., 2017; Medley and Thomas, 2019; Wang et al., 2019), this trend is not reproduced by regional climate 
models or reanalyses used to drive them (Figure Atlas.30) (van Wessem et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019).  
 
According to the ice core reconstructions, SMB over WAN (including AP) has likely increased during the 
20th century with trends of 5.4 ± 2.9 Gt yr–1 per decade (1900–2010) (Wang et al., 2019) mitigating global 
mean sea level rise by, respectively, 0.28 ± 0.17 mm per decade (WAN excluding AP, during 1901–2000) 
and 0.62 ± 0.17 mm per decade (AP, during 1979–2000) (Medley and Thomas, 2019). Significant spatial 
heterogeneity in SMB trends has been observed over AP and WAN: 

- western AP has likely experienced a significant increase in SMB beginning around 1930 and 
accelerating during 1970–2010, which is outside of the natural variability range of the past 300 years 
(Thomas et al., 2017; Medley and Thomas, 2019; Wang et al., 2019);  
- eastern AP has no significant SMB trends during the same period (low confidence, observations 
limited to one ice core and large interannual variability) (Thomas et al., 2017; Engel et al., 2018);  
- overall WAN SMB (excluding AP) was stable during 1980–2009 but exhibited high regional 
variability (Medley et al., 2013): significant increases (5–15 mm per decade during 1957–2000) to 
the east of the West Antarctic ice sheet divide and significant decrease (–1 to –5 mm per decade 
during 1901–1956, and –5 to –15 mm per decade during 1957–2000) to the west (Medley and 
Thomas, 2019; Wang et al., 2019).  
 
The SMB of EAN increased during the 20th century which mitigated global mean sea level rise by 0.77 ± 
0.40 mm per decade during 1901–2000 (Medley and Thomas, 2019) (medium confidence). EAN SMB has 
been increasing at a much lower rate since 1979 as shown by observations, while regional climate models 
show strong interannual variability masking any trend (Medley and Thomas, 2019; Rignot et al., 2019) 
(Figure Atlas.30) (low confidence due to limited observations). EAN SMB changes during the 20th century 
and recent decades showed large spatial heterogeneity: 
- With significant increases likely in Queen Maud Land (QML): 5.2 ± 3.7% per decade during 1920–
2011 measured in ice core near the Kohnen station (Medley et al., 2018), an increase on the plateau 
(Altnau et al., 2015), and stable conditions during 1993–2010 along the annual stake line from 
Syowa (coast) to Dome F (plateau) (Wang et al., 2015b); increases during 1911–2010 (Thomas et 
al., 2017) with anomalously high SMB observed in 2009 and 2011 (Boening et al., 2012; Lenaerts et 
al., 2013; Gorodetskaya et al., 2014); 
- increases in Wilkes Land and Queen Mary Land during 1957–2000 (Thomas et al., 2017; Medley 
and Thomas, 2019) (low confidence due to limited observations and strong spatial variability); 
- a likely stable SMB in the interior of the East Antarctic plateau during the 1901–2000 period and the 
last decades (Thomas et al., 2017; Medley and Thomas, 2019); 
- stable in Adelie Land (annual stake line during 1971–2008) (Agosta et al., 2012) (low confidence 
due to limited evidence).

Regional trends of the last 50 years (1961–2010) and 100 years (1911–2010) are within centennial variability 
of the past 1000 years, except for coastal QML (unusual 100-year increase in accumulation) and for coastal 
Victoria Land (unusual 100-year decrease in accumulation) (Thomas et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the current 
EAN SMB is not unusual compared to the past 800 years (Frezzotti et al., 2013).  
 
The geographic pattern of accumulation changes since the 1950s bears a strong imprint of a trend towards a 
more positive phase of the SAM (e.g., Medley and Thomas, 2019), which could be linked to ozone depletion 
(Lenaerts et al., 2018) or large-scale atmospheric warming (Frieler et al., 2015; Medley and Thomas, 2019). 
More evidence has emerged showing the importance of the Pacific-South American Pattern, ENSO and 
Pacific Ocean convection, and large-scale blocking causing warm-air intrusions and both extreme 
precipitation and melt events, responsible for large interannual SMB variability (high confidence) 
(Gorodetskaya et al., 2014; Bodart and Bingham, 2019; Scott et al., 2019; Turner et al., 2019; Wille et al., 
2019; Adusumilli et al., 2021). This strengthens evidence for an important connection between Antarctic 
climate and tropical sea surface temperature stated by SROCC (Meredith et al., 2019). Section 3.4.3 and 
SROCC (Meredith et al., 2019) provide a discussion of attribution of Antarctic ice sheet changes.  
 
 
### Atlas.11.1.3 Assessment of model performance 
 
This section provides evaluation of atmospheric global and regional climate models, including reanalyses. 
Evaluation of the ice sheet models and relevant processes, including selection of the atmospheric models 
used to drive ice sheet models, is given in Section 9.4.2.2. 
 
One of the major systematic biases in CMIP5 and earlier GCMs was an equatorward bias in the latitude of 
the Southern Hemisphere mid‐latitude westerly jet, which is significantly reduced in the CMIP6 ensemble 
(Bracegirdle et al., 2020a). GCM Southern Ocean sea-ice biases are also of importance as they influence 21st 
century temperature projections in Antarctica and simulation of present day temperatures are highly sensitive 
to these biases (Agosta et al., 2015; Bracegirdle et al., 2015). A positive bias in near-surface temperature 
over the Antarctic plateau is seen in CMIP5 models (Lenaerts et al., 2016).  
 
CMIP6 GCMs showed an improved representation of the Antarctic near-surface temperature compared to 
CMIP5 but little improvement (maintaining positive bias) in Antarctic precipitation estimates (Palerme et al., 
2017; Roussel et al., 2020). An analysis of the 1850–2000 SMB mean, trends and interannual and spatial 
variability suggests slightly worse agreement with ice-core-based reanalyses in CMIP6 than CMIP5 (Gorte 
et al., 2020). Comparison of CMIP5 models with CloudSat satellite products and an ice-core-based SMB 
reconstruction showed almost all the models overestimate current Antarctic precipitation, some by more than 
100% (Palerme et al., 2017; Gorte et al., 2020). GCM simulations of surface snow-melt processes are of 
variable quality, with extremely simple representatons, or non-existent (Agosta et al., 2015; Trusel et al., 
2015). Though most meltwater refreezes in the snowpack in current climate simulations this may be an issue 
in the future climate simulations under global warming as run-off is projected to increase (Kittel et al., 2021). 
Since CMIP5, representation of snow (Lenaerts et al., 2016) and stable surface boundary layers (Vignon et 
al., 2018) has improved in some atmospheric GCMs. In one example, the CMIP6 model CESM2 simulation 
of cloud and precipitation showed substantial improvements (Schneider et al., 2020) though surface melting 
is still considerably overestimated compared to RCMs and satellite products (Trusel et al., 2015; Lenaerts et 
al., 2016).  
 
Assimilation of observations in reanalysis products yields realistic temperature patterns and seasonal 
variations, with the recent ERA5 reanalysis showing improved performance compared to others for mean 
and extreme temperature, wind and humidity, though a warm bias in the near-surface air temperatures 
remains (Retamales-Muñoz et al., 2019; Tetzner et al., 2019; Dong et al., 2020; Gorodetskaya et al., 2020). 
The ability of the reanalyses to simulate precipitation and SMB is more variable; they generally overestimate 
the latter (Gossart et al., 2019; Roussel et al., 2020), but are well suited to provide atmospheric and sea 
surface boundary conditions to drive RCMs.  
 
Recent higher-resolution simulations covering the entire Antarctic ice sheet with a grid spacing of 12 to 50 
km include five Polar-CORDEX RCMs – RACMO2 (van Wessem et al., 2018), MAR (Agosta et al., 2019; 
Kittel et al., 2021), COSMO-CLM2 (Souverijns et al., 2019), HIRHAM5 (Lucas-Picher et al., 2012), and 
MetUM (Walters et al., 2017; Mottram et al., 2021) – and one stretched-grid GCM – ARPEGE (Beaumet et 
al., 2019). RCM simulations forced by ERA-Interim agree well with automatic weather station temperatures, 
with high correlation (R2 > 0.9) and low bias (<1.5°C) except for high resolution HIRHAM5 (–2.1°C) and 
MetUM (–3.4°C), which are not internally nudged models (Mottram et al., 2021). RCMs generally 
underestimate the observed SMB but with biases lower than 20%, except for COSMO-CLM2 at lower 
elevations (<1200 m) and HIRHAM5 and MetUM at higher elevations (>2200 m) (Mottram et al., 2021). 
These RCM simulations lead to estimates of the grounded Antarctic ice sheet SMB ranging from 2133 Gt yr–
1 to 2328 Gt yr–1 when considering the four simulations compatible with the IMBIE2 Antarctic total mass 
budget (IMBIE team et al., 2018; Mottram et al., 2021). However, the simulated spatial pattern of SMB 
differs widely between models suggesting the importance of missing or under-represented processes in the 
models, such as drifting-snow transport and sublimation (Agosta et al., 2019), cloud-precipitation 
microphysical processes (van Wessem et al., 2018) and snowpack modelling (Mottram et al., 2021). 
Comparisons of integrated SMB estimates between models are also complicated by different resolutions and 
continental ice masks, with models showing large differences in the absolute SMB (Mottram et al., 2021) but 
better agreement for SMB annual rates (Figure Atlas.30) 
 
Finer resolution RCM studies demonstrate improved representation of precipitation and temperature 
gradients (van Wessem et al., 2018; Bozkurt et al., 2020; Donat-Magnin et al., 2020; Elvidge et al., 2020), 
and strength of katabatic winds (Bintanja et al., 2014; Souverijns et al., 2019) in coastal and mountainous 
regions. Adequate representation of some processes is still lacking, including drifting snow, sublimation of 
falling snow or the spectral dependency of snow albedo (Lenaerts et al., 2019). Non-hydrostatic regional 
models, for example Polar-WRF, MetUM or HARMONIE-AROME at spatial resolutions up to 2 km further 
improve regional RCM simulations, but are still often unable to resolve relevant feedbacks and foehn 
processes (Grosvenor et al., 2014; Elvidge et al., 2015, 2020; Elvidge and Renfrew, 2016; King et al., 2017; 
Turton et al., 2017; Bozkurt et al., 2018b; Hines et al., 2019; Vignon et al., 2019; Gilbert et al., 2020). 

Existing uncertainties in the Antarctic climate representation by both GCMs and RCMs cause significant 
spread in the future Antarctic climate and SMB projections (Gorte et al., 2020; Kittel et al., 2021). Run-time 
bias adjustment in atmospheric GCMs (Krinner et al., 2019, 2020) (see also Cross-Chapter Box 10.2) has 
been proposed to provide low-bias present and consistently-corrected future RCM forcing (reducing the need 
for coupled model selection), which could be used directly for Antarctic climate projections (Krinner et al., 
2019).

### Atlas.11.1.4 Assessment and synthesis of projections 
 
This section provides an assessment of projections in temperature, precipitation and SMB. See Section 9.4.2 
for projected changes in the ice sheet total mass balance and relevant processes and see Section 4.3.1 (Table 
4.2) and Section 4.5.1 for Antarctic temperature projections relative to other regions. 
 
The Antarctic region is very likely to experience a significant increase in annual mean temperature and 
precipitation by the end of this century under all emission scenarios used in CMIP5 and CMIP6 (Bracegirdle 
et al., 2015, 2020b; Frieler et al., 2015; Lenaerts et al., 2016; Previdi and Polvani, 2016; Palerme et al., 
2017)(Figure Atlas.29). Ensemble means (and 10th–90th percentile ranges) of end-of-century (2081–2100) 
projected Antarctic surface air temperature change from 35 CMIP6 models and relative to 1995–2014 are 
1.2°C (0.5°C–2.0°C) for the SSP1-2.6 emissions scenarios, 2.3°C (1.3°C–3.4°C) for SSP2-4.5, 3.5°C 
(2.0°C–5°C) for SSP3-7.0 and 4.4°C (2.8°C–6.4°C) for SSP5-8.5 (Interactive Atlas). Both temperature and 
precipitation projections are characterised by a relatively large multi-model range (Figure Atlas.29, 
Interactive Atlas). A strong regional variability is present with the projected changes over coastal Antarctica 
not scaling linearly with global forcing. While continental mean temperatures are linearly related to global 
mean temperatures in CMIP6 models, the relative increase in coastal temperatures are higher for low-
emissions scenarios due to stronger relative Southern Ocean warming and relatively stronger effects of ozone 
recovery (Bracegirdle et al., 2020b). A higher multi-model average increase in temperature is projected by 
CMIP6 models compared to CMIP5, with a 1.3°C higher mean Antarctic near-surface temperature at the end 
of 21st century (Kittel et al., 2021). While similar median temperature changes are projected for WAN and 
EAN, the former shows larger spread and higher projected temperature range in both CMIP5 and CMIP6 
models and for all scenarios (Figure Atlas.29). CORDEX-Antarctica simulations show a mean and range in 
the future temperature changes similar to the subset of CMIP5 models used to drive them for the RCP8.5 
scenario and 1.5°C, 2°C and 3°C global warming levels (GWL) (Figure Atlas.29). 
 
There is high confidence that projected future surface-air temperature increase over Antarctica will be 
accompanied by precipitation increase (Figure Atlas.29). CMIP6 models show a similar or larger but more 
constrained increase in precipitation (more models agreeing with larger precipitation increase) for the same 
GWLs compared to CMIP5. For example, over WAN during JJA for 3°C GWL, CMIP6 and CMIP5 models 
project a median 15% increase in precipitation with a 10th–90th percentile range of 7–25% in CMIP6 
models and of 3–24% in CMIP5. Average precipitation changes relative to 1995–2014 over WAN and EAN 
are largely similar, and show projected increases for SSP2-4.5 (SSP5-8.5) of around 5% (5%) for 2021–
2040, 7% (10%) for 2041–2060, and 12% (25%) for 2081–2100 with smaller increases projected for SSP1-
2.6 emissions, reaching around 5% in 2081–2100. Regionally, the largest relative precipitation increase is 
projected (under all scenarios) for the eastern part of WAN, the western AP, large parts of EAN plateau and 
over coastal EAN within 0°E–90°E longitudinal sector (Interactive Atlas). The largest increase in absolute 
precipitation amount is projected along the coastal regions, with the largest increase over coastal WAN and 
the western AP, and is projected to be largely driven by the increase in maximum 5-day precipitation 
(Interactive Atlas), which is in line with the dominant contribution of extreme snowfall events to the total 
annual precipitation in the present Antarctic climate (Boening et al., 2012; Gorodetskaya et al., 2014; Turner 
et al., 2020). Under all emission scenarios, the coastal precipitation increase corresponds to the snowfall 
increase, except for the northern and central part of the western AP, where snowfall is projected to decrease 
and rainfall to increase (similarly to the tendency towards increased precipitation, decreased snowfall and 
increase in rainfall over the Southern Ocean) (Interactive Atlas).  
 
From 2000 to 2100, the grounded Antarctic SMB is projected to mitigate sea level rise for RCP4.5 (RCP8.5) 
by the following sea level equivalents (SLE), 0.03 ± 0.02 m (0.08 ± 0.04 m SLE) from 30 CMIP5 models 
and for SSP2-4.5 (SSP5-8.5) by 0.03 ± 0.03 m SLE (0.07 ± 0.04 m SLE) from 24 CMIP6 models (Gorte et 
al., 2020). Subsets or downscaling of CMIP AOGCMs lead to 21st century cumulative projections in the 
range of 0.05 ± 0.03 m SLE for CMIP5 RCP8.5 and 0.08 ± 0.04 m SLE for CMIP6 SSP5-8.5 (Gorte et al., 
2020; Nowicki et al., 2020; Seroussi et al., 2020; Kittel et al., 2021). Use of model subsets reduces spread 
leading to either lower or higher climate sensitivity in the Antarctic depending on the selection method. For 
example, models selected by Gorte et al. (2020) based on SMB ice-core reconstruction from Medley and 
Thomas (2019) tend to underestimate strongly winter sea ice area (Agosta et al., 2015; Roach et al., 2020) 
and show reduced 21st century increase in Antarctic SMB compared to the full ensembles (Agosta et al., 
2015; Bracegirdle et al., 2015). A different subset of models is used for ISMIP6 (Section 9.4.2.3) which 
gives a lower increase in Antarctic SMB than the full ensemble for CMIP5 but a larger increase for CMIP6.  
 
Polar-CORDEX RCMs show higher variability in precipitation projections compared to CMIP5 models with 
a similar spatial pattern of the areas with precipitation increase over continental Antarctica but with higher 
local magnitude and also showing a larger increase over the Weddell Sea ice shelves (Interactive Atlas). 
CMIP5 and CMIP6 models, bias-adjusted based on regional climate model simulations, showed that the 
projected warming is expected to result in increased surface melting over the Antarctic ice shelves, with 
meltwater runoff under RCP8.5 and SSP5-8.5 becoming larger than precipitation over ice shelves over the 
period 2045–2050, surpassing intensities that were linked with the collapse of Larsen A and B ice shelves 
(Trusel et al., 2015; Kittel et al., 2021). Given the existing uncertainty in the present precipitation and SMB 
simulations and the significant range in the projected precipitation increase under various emissions 
scenarios in CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX models, there is medium confidence that the future Antarctic 
SMB will have a negative contribution to sea level during the 21st century under all emissions scenarios (see 
Section 9.4.2.3 for assessment of the drivers of future Antarctic ice sheet change and Section 9.4.2.6 for 
longer time scales).  
 
 
### Atlas.11.1.5 Summary 
 
Observations show a very likely widespread, strong warming trend starting in 1950s in the Antarctic 
Peninsula. Significant warming trends are observed in other West Antarctic regions and at selected stations 
in East Antarctica (medium confidence). Antarctic precipitation and SMB showed a significant positive trend 
over the 20th century according to the ice cores, while large interannual variability masks any existing trend 
over the satellite period since the end of 1970s (medium confidence).  
 
An assessment of model performance for the present day shows that high-resolution regional climate models 
with polar-optimised physics are important for estimating SMB and generating climate information, and 
show improved realizations compared to reanalyses and GCMs when evaluated against observations. At the 
same time, CMIP6 GCMs showed an improved representation of the Antarctic near-surface temperature 
compared to CMIP5, though still struggle with the representation of precipitation. There is therefore medium 
confidence in the capacity of climate models to simulate Antarctic climate and SMB changes.  
 
Under all assessed emission scenarios, both West and East Antarctica are very likely to have higher annual 
mean surface air temperatures and more precipitation, which will have a dominant influence on determining 
future changes in the SMB (high confidence). However, due to the challenges of model evaluation over the 
region and the possibility of increased meltwater runoff described above, there is only medium confidence 
that the future contribution of the Antarctic SMB to sea level this century will be negative under all 
greenhouse-gas emission scenarios.  
 
 
## Atlas.11.2  Arctic 
 
### Atlas.11.2.1 Key features of the regional climate and findings from previous IPCC assessments 
 
#### Atlas.11.2.1.1  Key features of the regional climate 
The Arctic region comprises the Arctic Ocean (ARO), Russian Arctic (RAR), Greenland and Iceland (GIC) 
and other surrounding land areas in Europe (NEW) and North America (NEN, NWN) (Figure Atlas.29). The 
region is one of the coldest and driest regions on Earth and plays a key role influencing global and regional 
climates and the hydrological cycle. A number of physical processes contribute to amplified Arctic 
temperature variations as compared to the global temperature, in particular thermodynamic changes that 
include the increase in surface absorption of solar radiation due to surface albedo feedbacks related with sea-
ice, ice, and snow-cover retreat as well as poleward energy transports, water-vapour-radiation and cloud-
radiation feedbacks (Screen and Simmonds, 2010; Serreze and Barry, 2011; Pithan and Mauritsen, 2014; 
Bintanja and Krikken, 2016; Graversen and Burtu, 2016; Franzke et al., 2017; Stuecker et al., 2018). 
Precipitation in the Arctic is dominated by snowfall, with rainfall present mostly during the summer period. 
Arctic climate is influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation, the leading mode of atmospheric variability in 
the North Atlantic basin with a northward extension into the Arctic affecting temperature, precipitation and 
sea ice over the region, with ENSO and Atlantic Multidecadal Variability also affecting parts of the region 
(Annex IV). Further, the Greenland Ice Sheet contribution to sea-level results from the imbalance between 
mass gain by net snow accumulation and mass loss by meltwater runoff and ice discharge into the ocean 
(IMBIE team, 2020), highlighting that the ice sheet is a major contributor to sea level changes.  
 
 
#### Atlas.11.2.1.2  Findings from previous IPCC assessments 
The following summary from previous IPCC reports is derived from the SROCC (IPCC, 2019a) unless 
otherwise stated. Arctic surface air temperatures have increased from the mid-1950s, with feedbacks from 
loss of sea ice and snow cover contributing to the amplified warming (high confidence) (IPCC, 2018c), and 
have likely increased by more than double the global average over the last two decades (high confidence). 
Arctic snow cover in June has declined from 1967 to 2018 (high confidence). Arctic glaciers are losing mass 
(very high confidence) and this along with changes in high-mountain snow melt have caused changes in 
hydrology, including river runoff, that are projected to continue in the near term (high confidence). The rate 
of ice loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet has increased; during 2006–2015 the loss was 278 ± 11 Gt yr-1 with 
the rate for 2012–2016 higher than for 2002–2011 and several times higher than during 1992–2001 (high 
confidence). 
 
The Arctic sea-ice area is declining in all months of the year (very high confidence) with the September sea-
ice minimum very likely having reduced by 12.8 ± 2.3% per decade during the satellite era (1979 to 2018) to 
levels unprecedented for at least 1000 years (medium confidence).  
 
The high latitudes are likely to experience an increase in annual mean precipitation under RCP8.5 (IPCC, 
2013c). Further, changes in precipitation will not be uniform. Autumn and spring snow cover duration are 
projected to decrease by a further 5–10% from current conditions in the near term (2031–2050). No further 
losses are projected under RCP2.6 whereas a further 15–25% reduction in snow cover duration is projected 
by the end of century under RCP8.5 (high confidence). 

### Atlas.11.2.2 Assessment and synthesis of observations, trends and attribution 
 
The Arctic has warmed at more than twice the global rate over the past 50 years with the greatest warming 
during the cold season (Davy et al., 2018; Box et al., 2019; Przybylak and Wyszyński, 2020; Xiao et al., 
2020) (high confidence). This is based on various Arctic amplification processes, in particular the combined 
effect of several related feedback processes including sea-ice and snow-cover albedo and water-vapour-
cloud-radiation feedbacks as well as poleward energy transports. The annual average Arctic surface air 
temperature increased by 2.7°C from 1971 to 2017, with a 3.1°C increase in the cold season (October–May) 
and a 1.8°C increase in the warm season (June–September) (AMAP, 2019). Satellite-based data estimate the 
rate of annual warming for 1981–2012 over sea-ice covered regions to be 0.47°C per decade, whereas the 
trend was significantly higher at 0.77°C per decade over Greenland and amplified in the northern Barents 
and Kara seas (Comiso and Hall, 2014). The largest Arctic warming in 2003–2017 was reported over the 
Barents and Kara Seas with trends larger than 2.5°C per decade (Susskind et al., 2019) and Arctic 
temperatures from 2014 to 2018 have exceeded all previous records since 1900 (Blunden and Arndt, 2019). 
 
Over the ARO, long-term temperature records are available from Spitsbergen (Svalbard Airport). For the 
period 1898–2018, the annual mean warming was 0.32°C per decade, about 3.5 times the global mean 
temperature for the same period and since 1991, 1.7°C per decade or about seven times the global average 
for the same period (Nordli et al., 2020). There is a positive trend in the annual temperature for all stations 
across Svalbard (Gjelten et al., 2016; Hanssen-Bauer et al., 2019; Dahlke et al., 2020) of 0.64°C–1.01°C per 
decade for 1971–2017 (Hanssen-Bauer et al., 2019) co-varying with regional changes in sea-ice conditions 
(Dahlke et al., 2020). The largest temperature trends very likely occur in winter, with Svalbard airport 
warming at 0.43°C per decade during 1898–2018 and 3.19°C per decade during 1991–2018 (Nordli et al., 
2020) and Isaksen et al. (2016) reporting on substantial warming in western Spitsbergen, particularly in 
winter, while the summer warming is moderate.  
 
A multi-dataset analysis for NEN shows a consistent warming (Rapaić et al., 2015), with the largest annual 
temperature trend greater than 0.3°C per decade during 1981 to 2010 over eastern NEN and also significant 
warming over northern Quebec and most of the Canadian Arctic north of the treeline. For the longer 1950–
2010 period, a consistent warming is found over central and western NEN, but no trend or no consensus is 
found over the Labrador coast. The latter is related with cooling of the North Atlantic region during the 
1970s. For western Greenland, however, summer temperatures increased (2.2°C in June, 1.1°C in July) from 
1994 to 2015 (Saros et al., 2019). For neighbouring Arctic regions of NEU, WSE and ESB, datasets show a 
consistent warming of annual mean temperature since the mid-1970s and 1980 (see Sections Atlas.8 and 
Atlas.5.2). 
 
Along with the amplified warming, the Arctic has become moister (Rinke et al., 2019; Nygård et al., 2020). 
AMAP reported Arctic precipitation increases of 1.5–2.0% per decade, with the strongest increase in the cold 
season (October–May) (AMAP, 2019) (medium confidence). Also, for neighbouring Arctic regions for 
example NEU, EEU and Northern Asia, mean annual precipitation has increased since the early 20th century 
(see Sections Atlas.8 and Atlas.5.2). Estimated trends for precipitation and snowfall fraction are mixed for 
Arctic, with increases and decreases for different regions and seasons (Vihma et al., 2016). However, annual 
precipitation trends derived from different reanalyses do not agree, differ in sign and have low significance 
(Lindsay et al., 2014; Boisvert et al., 2018). Direct precipitation measurements are difficult and include 
uncertainties (among others measuring frozen precipitation), therefore precipitation estimates in the Arctic 
rely on climate models and reanalyses.  
 
An average of five reanalyses for 2000–2010 suggests around 40% of Arctic Ocean precipitation falls as 
snow, though there is large uncertainty in this estimate (Boisvert et al., 2018). Rainfall frequency is 
estimated to have increased over the Arctic by 2.7–5.4% over 2000–2016 (Boisvert et al., 2018) with more 
frequent rainfall events reported for NEU and ARO (Svalbard) (Maturilli et al., 2015; AMAP, 2019), and 
winter rain totals and frequency have increased in Svalbard since 2000 (Łupikasza et al., 2019) (medium 
confidence). Rain-free winters have rarely occurred since 1998 (Peeters et al., 2019).  
 
Observational records (1966 to 2010) for the RAR region show changing precipitation characteristics (Ye et 
al., 2016), with higher precipitation intensity but lower frequency and little change in annual precipitation 
total. Precipitation intensity is reported to have increased in all seasons, strongest in winter and spring, 
weakest in summer, and at a rate of about 1–3% per degree Celsius of air temperature increase.  
 
### Atlas.11.2.3 Assessment of model performance 
 
Evaluating simulated temperature and precipitation is problematic in the Arctic due to sparse weather station 
observations. The lack of reliable observed precipitation datasets for the Arctic thus makes it very unlikely to 
be able to evaluate objectively the skill of models to reproduce precipitation patterns (Takhsha et al., 2018). 
 
The CMIP5 models reproduce the observed Arctic warming over the past century (Chylek et al., 2016; Hao 
et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2019) (medium confidence). The simulated mean Arctic warming for 1900–2014 
averaged over 40 CMIP5 models is 2.7°C compared to the observed values of 2.2°C (NASA GISS data 
smoothed using a 1200-km radius) or 1.7°C (using a 250-km smoothing radius) (Chylek et al., 2016). 
However, there are large inter-model differences in the simulated warming which ranges from 1.2°C to 
5.0°C. Although the CMIP5 models reproduce the spatially averaged observed warming over the past 50 to 
100 years, the pattern is different from that of observations and reanalysis (Xie et al., 2016; Franzke et al., 
2017; Hao et al., 2018). Zonal mean temperature trends in the CMIP5 models overestimate the warming in 
the cold season over high latitudes in the northern hemisphere (Xie et al., 2016). Overall, the amplified 
Arctic warming in the recent decades is overestimated by CMIP5 models (Huang et al., 2019). Possible 
reasons are modelled sea surface temperature biases and an overestimated temperature response to the Arctic 
sea-ice decline. Furthermore, some models, which have a warm or weak bias in their Arctic temperature 
simulations, closely relate the Arctic warming to changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulation. In other 
models, which show large cold biases, the albedo feedback effect plays a more important role for the 
temperature trend magnitude. This implies that the dominant simulated Arctic warming mechanism and trend 
may be dependent on the bias of the model mean state (Franzke et al., 2017). Compared to CMIP5 models, 
Davy and Outten (2020) found lower biases in CMIP6 models’ representation of sea-ice extent and volume 
with improved extents linked to a better seasonal cycle in the Barents Sea. 
 
Rapid temperature changes, such as the pronounced increase of 2°C yr–1 during 2003–2012 over the Kara 
and Barents Seas in March is well captured in Arctic CORDEX simulations (Kohnemann et al., 2017). The 
models show adequate skill in capturing the general temperature patterns (Koenigk et al., 2015; Matthes et 
al., 2015; Hamman et al., 2016; Cassano et al., 2017; Brunke et al., 2018; Diaconescu et al., 2018; Takhsha 
et al., 2018), but tend to show a cold temperature bias which is largest in winter and depends on the reference 
dataset. Cassano et al. (2017) showed a large sensitivity of the simulated surface climate to changes in 
atmospheric model physics. In particular, large changes in radiative flux biases, driven by changes in 
simulated clouds, lead to large differences in temperature and precipitation biases. 
 
The CMIP5 models perform well in simulating 20th-century snowfall for the northern hemisphere, although 
there is a positive bias in the multi-model ensemble relative to the observed data in many regions (Krasting 
et al., 2013b). Lack of sufficient spatial resolution in the model topography has a serious impact on the 
simulation of snowfall. The patterns of relative maxima and minima of snowfall, however, are captured 
reasonably well by the models. 
  
Arctic CORDEX RCMs reproduce the dominant features of regional precipitation patterns and extremes 
(e.g., Glisan and Gutowski, 2014; Hamman et al., 2016). Due to their higher spatial resolution, RCMs 
simulates larger amounts of orographic precipitation compared to reanalyses. Overall, the simulated 
precipitation is within the reanalysis and global model ensemble spread, but the Arctic river basin 
precipitation is closer to observations (Brunke et al., 2018). However, Takhsha et al. (2018) show that the 
RCMs precipitation bias highly depends on the observational reference dataset used.  
 
The annual mean precipitation pattern of ensemble global atmospheric simulations with a high horizontal 
resolution agrees well with the observations, with precipitation maxima over the Greenland and Norwegian 
Seas (Kusunoki et al., 2015). However, the simulated Arctic average annual precipitation shows a positive 
bias with excessive precipitation over Alaska and the western Arctic (Kattsov et al., 2017). 

Regarding the Greenland Ice Sheet (region GIC), modelled surface mass balance (SMB) has decreased since 
the end of the 1990s (Fettweis et al., 2020). A multi-model inter-comparison study (Fettweis et al., 2020) 
emphasized a simulated positive mean annual SMB of 338 ± 68 Gt yr-1 between 1980 and 2012, with a 
decreasing average rate of 7.3 ± 2.0 Gt yr-2, mainly driven by an increase in meltwater runoff. Mouginot et 
al. (2019) stated that SMB played a strong role in the ice sheet mass loss, where SMB dominated in the last 
two decades. Mottram et al. (2019) found that SMB processes dominate the ice sheet mass budget over most 
of the interior, highlighting that the ice sheet is a contributor to global mean sea level rise between 1991 and 
2015. More specifically, SMB models have improved (Fettweis et al., 2020; Hanna et al., 2021) due to 
increased availability and quality of remotely sensed (Koenig et al., 2016; Overly et al., 2016) and in-situ 
observations (Machguth et al., 2016; Fausto et al., 2018; Vandecrux et al., 2019, 2020). Fettweis et al. (2020) 
showed that the models’ ensemble mean provides the best estimate of the present-day SMB relative to 
observations. This is the case for the patterns in all seven regions (regional division after Mouginot et al., 
2019) apart from the SE accumulation zone where large discrepancies in modelled snowfall accumulation 
occurred where the spread can reach 2 m water equivalent per year. Montgomery et al. (2020) confirmed this 
highlighting that RCMs (MAR and RACMO) are underestimating accumulation in southeast Greenland and 
that models misrepresent spatial heterogeneity due to an orographically forced bias in snowfall near the 
coast. Further, for northeast Greenland, Karlsson et al. (2020) found RCMs underestimate snow 
accumulation rates by up to 35%. The regional time series show that SMB has been gradually decreasing in 
all seven regions (1979–2017), although the trend is less strong in central-eastern and southeast regions. In 
the southwest, northeast and northwest, SMB turns negative or close to zero after 2000 and remains above 
zero in other regions (Figure Atlas.30) (medium confidence).  
 
 
### Atlas.11.2.4 Assessment and synthesis of projections 
 
Mean temperature in the Arctic is projected to continue to rise through the 21st century significantly higher 
than the global average (Figure Atlas.29 and Interactive Atlas). For the regions NWN and NEN, see Section 
Atlas.9. The Arctic is projected to reach a 2°C annual mean warming above the 1981–2005 baseline about 25 
to 50 years before the globe as a whole under RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 (Post et al., 2019). The Arctic warming 
may be as much as 4°C in the annual mean and 7°C in late autumn under 2°C global warming, regardless of 
which scenario is considered (Post et al., 2019) (high confidence). 
 
Projections from 40 CMIP5 models of the 2014–2100 Arctic annual warming under RCP4.5 vary from 0.9°C 
to 6.7°C, with a multi-model mean of 3.7°C (Chylek et al., 2016). All models agree on a projected Arctic 
amplification (of at least 1.5 times), but they disagree on the magnitude and spatial patterns. Arctic warming 
trends projected by models that include a full direct and indirect aerosol effect (‘fully aerosol-cloud 
interactive’) are significantly higher than those projected by models without a full indirect aerosol effect 
(Chylek et al., 2016).  
 
Projected Arctic warming exhibits a very pronounced seasonal cycle, with exceptionally strong warming in 
the winter. In projections from 30 CMIP5 models, winter warming over ARO varies regionally from 3°C to 
5°C by mid-century and 5°C to 9°C by late-century under RCP4.5 (AMAP, 2017) (high confidence). 
Averaged over the Arctic and based on 36 CMIP5 models, winter warming is 5.8 ± 1.5°C by mid-century 
and 7.1 ± 2.3°C by 2100 under RCP4.5 (Overland et al., 2019), and an exceptionally strong warming of up to 
14.1 ± 2.9°C is projected in December under RCP8.5 (Bintanja and Krikken, 2016). Bintanja and Van Der 
Linden (2013) estimated the Arctic winter warming over the 21st century to exceed the summer warming by 
at least a factor of four, irrespective of the magnitude of the climate forcing.  
 
Overland et al. (2014) highlighted the difference between the near-term ‘adaptation timescale’ and the long-
term ‘mitigation timescale’ for the Arctic. Only in the latter half of the century do the projections under 
RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 noticeably separate. End-of-the-century warming is approximately twice as large under 
RCP8.5 demonstrating the impact of the lower emissions under RCP4.5 (AMAP, 2017) (high confidence). 
More specifically under the strong forcing scenario, annual mean surface air temperature in the Arctic is 
projected to increase by 8.5 ± 2.1°C over the course of the 21st century (Bintanja and Andry, 2017), and 
emerges as a ‘new Arctic’ climate being significantly different from that of the mid-20th century (Landrum 
and Holland, 2020). The end-of-the-century warming (2080–2099 relative to 1980–1999, RCP8.5) can 
exceed 15°C in autumn and winter over the Arctic Ocean (Koenigk et al., 2015). Projections averaged over 
the four best-performing CMIP5 models show an Arctic annual warming of 4.1°C (RCP2.6), 5.7°C 
(RCP4.5), and 10.6°C (RCP8.5) by 2100 compared to 1951–1980 (Hao et al., 2018). Also, for neighbouring 
Arctic regions, for example NEU, WSB and ESB, temperature is projected to increase towards the end of the 
century under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (see Sections Atlas.8 and Atlas.5.2). 
 
The ensemble of CMIP6 shows likely greater warming compared to CMIP5 (Figure Atlas.29). There is weak 
agreement among the models in projected temperature change over the Arctic North Atlantic under SSPs 
until the mid-century, but a robust warming signal clearly emerges even there by 2100 (Interactive Atlas). 
Generally, the largest annual warming is simulated over the Arctic Ocean, particularly over the Barents and 
Kara Seas. Future warming in CORDEX RCMs and the CMIP5 models are similar (Spinoni et al., 2020). 
The RCM warming over the AO is smaller, while the warming over land is larger in winter and spring but 
smaller in summer, compared with CMIP5 (Koenigk et al., 2015).  
 
Mean precipitation in ARO, GIC and RAR is projected to rise in a warming climate (Figure Atlas.29), with 
different rates for the different seasons and scenarios. For NWN and NEN, see Section Atlas.9. The CMIP5 
multi-model mean projected precipitation increase in the Arctic is likely of the order of 50% under RCP8.5 
by the end of 21st century, which is among the highest globally (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). Over 70°N–
90°N, the precipitation increase is likely 62 ± 20% and 56 ± 13% for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively. For 
ARO (Svalbard), the increase in annual precipitation by 2100 is estimated to be about 45% for RCP4.5 and 
65% for RCP8.5 (CMIP5 ensemble median) (Van der Bilt et al., 2019). However, importantly the simulated 
Arctic precipitation increase varies by a factor of three to four between models (Bintanja and Selten, 2014). 
The projected increase is strongest in late autumn and winter (Vihma et al., 2016). The interannual 
variability of Arctic precipitation will likely increase markedly (up to 40% over the 21st century), especially 
in summer (Bintanja et al., 2020) (medium confidence) 
 
The CMIP6 projections confirm precipitation will likely increase almost everywhere in the Arctic (see the 
Interactive Atlas). The largest increase is simulated over the Barents and Kara Seas and East Siberian Sea 
regions, and over northeast Greenland. A pronounced uncertainty in the projection exists over the Arctic 
North Atlantic and south Greenland. There, the precipitation signal is not significant even by the end of the 
21st century and under high-emission scenarios (RCP8.5, SSP5-8.5). Consistent with the generally higher 
warming in CMIP6, compared to CMIP5, the projected precipitation increase is also higher (Figure Atlas.29) 
(high confidence). 
 
The Arctic mean annual precipitation sensitivity has been estimated at 4.5% increase per degree Celsius of 
temperature rise, compared to a global average of 1.6–1.9% per degree Celsius of temperature rise (Bintanja 
and Selten, 2014) based on a set of 37 CMIP5 GCMs. Koenigk et al. (2015) stress the different precipitation 
sensitivity in winter (0.8 mm per month per degree Celsius of temperature rise) and summer (2 mm per 
month per degree Celsius of temperature rise). Dobler et al. (2016) support the high precipitation sensitivity 
for the projected temperature changes. The pattern and amplitude of precipitation changes agree in 
CORDEX simulations with their driving CMIP5 models (Koenigk et al., 2015; Spinoni et al., 2020) (high 
confidence). However, more small-scale variations over land and coastlines and significantly larger 
precipitation changes in summer are obvious in the downscaling. 
 
Rain is projected to become the dominant form of precipitation in the Arctic region by the end of the 21st 
century (Bintanja, 2018). The CMIP5 models show a decrease in annual Arctic snowfall under both RCP4.5 
and RCP8.5 (Krasting et al., 2013b; Bintanja and Andry, 2017) (high confidence). In the central Arctic, the 
snowfall fraction barely remains larger than 50%, with only Greenland still having snowfall fractions larger 
than 80% (Bintanja and Andry, 2017). The most dramatic reductions in snowfall fraction are projected to 
occur over the North Atlantic and especially the Barents Sea. 
 
With ongoing warming and polar amplification in the Arctic, the Greenland Ice Sheet SMB will inevitably 
continue to change (Lenaerts et al., 2019) (high confidence). For the ice sheet, despite large differences 
between model scenarios, future projections and regions agree that increasing temperatures will increase 
runoff which will in turn dominate the future decrease of SMB (Rae et al., 2012; van Angelen et al., 2014; 
Mottram et al., 2017; Hofer et al., 2020), confirming the high sensitivity of the SMB to atmospheric 
warming. Changes in SMB will continue to dominate future mass loss from the ice sheet, and likely even 
more when marine terminating glaciers retreat onto land, and solid ice discharge is reduced (Vizcaino, 2014; 
Lenaerts et al., 2019).  
 
 
### Atlas.11.2.5 Summary 
 
It is very likely that the Arctic has warmed at more than twice the global rate over the past 50 years and likely 
that annual precipitation has increased with the highest increases during the cold season. This is based on 
various Arctic amplification processes, in particular combination of several feedback-related processes such 
as sea-ice and snow-cover albedo, poleward energy transports, and water-vapour-cloud-radiation feedbacks. 
The frequency of rainfall increased over the Arctic by 2.7 to 5.4% over the 2000–2016 period with more 
frequent rainfall events being reported for northern Europe and Svalbard (medium confidence).  
 
The CMIP5 models reproduce the observed Arctic warming over the past century but overestimate the 
amplified Arctic warming in the recent decades (medium confidence). Arctic CORDEX simulations show 
adequate skill in capturing regional temperature and precipitation patterns and precipitation extremes (high 
confidence). SMB models have improved due to increased availability and quality of remotely sensed and in-
situ observations and an ensemble mean of SMB model simulations provides the best estimate of the present-
day SMB (medium confidence). 
 
It is very likely that the Arctic annual mean temperature and precipitation will continue to increase, reaching 
around 11.5 ± 3.4°C and 49 ± 19% over the 2081–2100 period (with respect to a 1995–2014 baseline) under 
the SSP5-8.5 scenario or 4.0 ± 2.5°C and 17 ± 11% under the SSP1-2.6 scenario. These CMIP6 results show 
likely higher Arctic annual mean temperatures compared to CMIP5 for a given time-period and emissions 
scenario, though the projections are consistent for global warming levels.  
 
 
# Atlas.12  Final remarks 
 
Developing from the WGI AR5 Atlas Annex (IPCC, 2013a), the Atlas is an innovation in the WGI 
contribution to the AR6, providing a region-by-region assessment of new knowledge on changes in mean 
climate and an online interactive tool, the Interactive Atlas. It demonstrates the diversity in the climate 
changes across these regions, in the evidence base for generating information on what changes have already 
occurred and why, and what further changes each region is likely to face in the future based on different 
emission scenarios. Finally, the Interactive Atlas allows for further exploration of the data underpinning 
assessment material generated by many of the other chapters. 
 
The foundation of the regional information generated by the Atlas chapter is an assessment of the significant 
body of new literature on regional climate change though noting substantial heterogeneity in both its 
availability and the involvement of regional expertise. In many regions this allows for an in-depth 
assessment though in some the range of information that can be provided and/or the level of confidence in 
the information is limited. There is similar heterogeneity in the availability of observations to assess recent 
trends and evaluate model performance, with a lack of curated regional datasets in polar regions, northern 
South America and Africa. 
 
Internal variability is a large contributor to the climate uncertainty at regional scales. Recent work has 
combined outputs of Single Model Initial-conditions Large Ensembles (SMILEs) with CMIP5 and CMIP6 to 
partition and gain insights on the modelled range and uncertainty arising from internal variability and from 
model response uncertainty for a given emission scenario (Deser et al., 2020; Lehner et al., 2020; Maher et 
al., 2021). The work highlights the notable role for internal variability at regional scales, particularly for 
precipitation in regions with weaker forced response, where internal variability can remain larger than model 
uncertainty or scenario uncertainty throughout the whole century. The Atlas (similar to the other regional 
chapters) uses a single realization per model (CMIP6 models provide multiple realizations, but it is not the 
case for CORDEX and less so for CMIP5) which allows for the comparison of the different lines of evidence 
but at the expense of internal variability having a larger influence on the ability to detect or quantify changes. 
 
The assessment produced in the Atlas is based on the individual results from the different lines of global and 
regional evidence and the consistency amongst them, as there is a lack of literature on methodologies that 
combine multiple lines of evidence to distil regional climate change information.
