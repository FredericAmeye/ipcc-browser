# Introduction 
 
The Working Group I (WGI) contribution to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth 
Assessment Report (AR6) assess the physical science basis of climate change. As part of that contribution, 
this Technical Summary (TS) is designed to bridge between the comprehensive assessment of the WGI 
Chapters and its Summary for Policymakers (SPM). It is primarily built from the Executive Summaries of 
the individual chapters and atlas and provides a synthesis of key findings based on multiple lines of evidence 
(e.g., analyses of observations, models, paleoclimate information and understanding of physical, chemical 
and biological processes and components of the climate system). All the findings and figures here are 
supported by and traceable to the underlying chapters, with relevant chapter sections indicated in curly 
brackets.  
 
Throughout this Technical Summary, key assessment findings are reported using the IPCC calibrated 
uncertainty language (Chapter 1, Box 1.1). Two calibrated approaches are used to communicate the degree 
of certainty in key findings, which are based on author teams’ evaluations of underlying scientific 
understanding: 
 

1. Confidence<ref>1</ref> is a qualitative measure of the validity of a finding, based on the type, amount, quality and consistency of evidence (e.g., data, mechanistic understanding, theory, models, expert judgment) and the degree of agreement; and 
2. Likelihood<ref>2</ref> provides a quantified measure of confidence in a finding expressed probabilistically (e.g., based on statistical analysis of observations or model results, or both, and expert judgement by the author team or from a formal quantitative survey of expert views, or both). 

Where there is sufficient scientific confidence, findings can also be formulated as statements of fact without 
uncertainty qualifiers. Throughout IPCC reports, the calibrated language is clearly identified by being 
typeset in italics.  
 
The context and progress in climate science (TS.1) is followed by a Cross-Section Box TS.1 on global 
surface temperature change. TS.2 provides information about past and future large-scale changes in all 
components of the climate system. TS.3 summarises knowledge and understanding of climate forcings, 
feedbacks and responses. Infographic TS.1 uses a storyline approach to integrate findings on possible climate 
futures. Finally, TS.4 provides a synthesis of climate information at regional scales.<ref>3</ref> The list of acronyms 
used in the WGI Report is in Annex VIII.  
 
The AR6 WGI report promotes best practices in traceability and reproducibility, including through adoption 
of the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles for scientific data. Each chapter 
has a data table (in its Supplementary Material) documenting the input data and code used to generate its 
figures and tables. In addition, a collection of data and code from the report has been made freely-available 
online via long-term archives. ([URL to access WGI data to be added by 30 June])  

These FAIR principles are central to the WGI Interactive Atlas, an online tool that complements the WGI 
Report by providing flexible spatial and temporal analyses of past, observed and projected climate change 
information. ([URL to access WGI data to be added by 30 June]).  
 
Regarding the representation of robustness and uncertainty in maps, the method chosen for the AR64 differs 
from the method used in the Sixth Assessment Report (AR5). This choice is based on new research in the 
visualization of uncertainty and on user surveys.      
 
<boxref>Box TS.1</boxref>
 
As part of the AR6 cycle, the IPCC produced three Special Reports in 2018 and 2019: the Special Report on 
Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5), the Special Report on Oceans and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate 
(SROCC), and the Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL).  
 
The AR6 WGI Report provides a full and comprehensive assessment of the physical science basis of climate 
change that builds on the previous assessments and these Special Reports and consider new information and 
knowledge from the recent scientific literature<ref>6</ref>, including longer observational datasets, new scenarios and 
model results.  
 
The structure of the AR6 WGI report is designed to enhance the visibility of knowledge developments and to 
facilitate the integration of multiple lines of evidence, thereby improving confidence in findings. The Report 
has been peer-reviewed by the scientific community and governments (Annex X provides the Expert 
Reviewer list). The substantive introduction provided by Chapter 1 is followed by a first set of chapters 
dedicated to large-scale climate knowledge (Chapters 2–4), which encompasses observations and 
paleoclimate evidence, causes of observed changes, and projections, and are complemented by Chapter 11 
for large-scale changes in extremes. The second set of chapters (Chapters 5–9) is orientated around the 
understanding of key climate system components and processes, including the global cycles of carbon, 
energy and water; short-lived climate forcers and their link to air quality; the ocean, cryosphere and sea level 
change. The last set of chapters (Chapters 10–12 and the Atlas) is dedicated to the assessment and distillation 
of regional climate information from multiple lines of evidence at sub-continental to local scales (including 
urban climate), with a focus on recent and projected regional changes in mean climate, extremes, and 
climatic impact-drivers. The new online Interactive Atlas allows users to interact in a flexible manner 
through maps, time series and summary statistics with climate information for a set of updated WGI 
reference regions. The Report also includes 34 Frequently Asked Questions and answers for the general 
public.
 
Together, this Technical Summary and the underlying chapters aim at providing a comprehensive picture of 
knowledge progress since the WGI AR5. Multiple lines of scientific evidence confirm that the climate is 
changing due to human influence. Important advances in the ability to understand past, present, and possible 
future changes should result in better-informed decision-making. 
 
Some of the new results and main updates to key findings in AR6 WGI compared to AR5, SR1.5, SRCCL, 
and SROCC are summarized below. Relevant Technical Summary sections with further details are shown in 
parenthesis after each bullet point.  
 
## Selected Updates and/or New Results since AR5 

- Human influence<ref>7</ref> on the climate system is now an established fact: The Fourth Assessment 
Report (AR4) stated in 2007 that ‘warming of the climate system is unequivocal’, and the AR5 
stated in 2013 that ‘human influence on the climate system is clear’. Combined evidence from across 
the climate system strengthens this finding. It is unequivocal that the increase of CO2, methane 
(CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human 
activities and that human influence is the principal driver of many changes observed across the 
atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere. (TS.1.2, TS.2.1) 
- Observed global warming to date: A combination of improved observational records and a series 
of very warm years since AR5 have resulted in a substantial increase in the estimated level of global 
warming to date. The contribution of changes in observational understanding alone between AR5 
and AR6 leads to an increase of about 0.1°C in the estimated warming since 1850–1900. For the 
decade 2011–2020, the increase in global surface temperature since 1850–1900 is assessed to be 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20] °C.<ref>8</ref> Estimates of crossing times of global warming levels and estimates of 
remaining carbon budgets are updated accordingly. (TS.1.2, Cross-Section Box TS.1) 
- Paleoclimate evidence: The AR5 assessed that many of the changes observed since the 1950s are 
unprecedented over decades to millennia. Updated paleoclimate evidence strengthens this 
assessment; over the past several decades, key indicators of the climate system are increasingly at 
levels unseen in centuries to millennia and are changing at rates unprecedented in at least the last 
2000 years. (Box TS.2, TS.2)  
- Updated assessment of recent warming: The AR5 reported a smaller rate of increase in global 
mean surface temperature over the period 1998–2012 than the rate calculated since 1951. Based on 
updated observational datasets showing a larger trend over 1998–2012 than earlier estimates, there is 
now high confidence that the observed 1998–2012 global surface temperature trend is consistent 
with ensembles of climate model simulations, and there is now very high confidence that the slower 
rate of global surface temperature increase observed over this period was a temporary event induced 
by internal and naturally forced variability that partly offset the anthropogenic surface warming 
trend over this period, while heat uptake continued to increase in the ocean. Since 2012, strong 
warming has been observed, with the past five years (2016–2020) being the hottest five-year period 
in the instrumental record since at least 1850 (high confidence). (TS.1.2, Cross-Section Box TS.1)  
- Magnitude of climate system response: In this Report, it has been possible to reduce the long-
standing uncertainty ranges for metrics that quantify the response of the climate system to radiative 
forcing, such as the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and the transient climate response (TCR), 
due to substantial advances (e.g., a 50% reduction in the uncertainty range of cloud feedbacks) and 
improved integration of multiple lines of evidence, including paleoclimate information. Improved 
quantification of effective radiative forcing, the climate system radiative response, and the observed 
energy increase in the Earth system over the past five decades demonstrate improved consistency 
between independent estimates of climate drivers, the combined climate feedbacks, and the observed 
energy increase relative to AR5. (TS.3.2) 
- Improved constraints on projections of future climate change: For the first time in an IPCC 
report, the assessed future change in global surface temperature is consistently constructed by 
combining scenario-based projections (which the AR5 focused on) with observational constraints 
based on past simulations of warming as well as the updated assessment of ECS and TCR. In 
addition, initialized forecasts have been used for the period 2019–2018. The inclusion of these lines 
of evidence reduces the assessed uncertainty for each scenario. (TS.1.3, Cross-Section Box TS.1)
- Air quality: The AR5 assessed that projections of air quality are driven primarily by precursor 
emissions, including methane. New scenarios explore a diversity of future options in air pollution 
management. The AR6 WGI reports rapid recent shifts in the geographical distribution of some of 
these precursor emissions, confirms the AR5 finding, and shows higher warming effects of short-
lived climate forcers in scenarios with the highest air pollution. (TS.1.3, TS.2.2, Box TS.7) 
- Effects of short-lived climate forcers on global warming: The AR5 assessed the radiative forcing 
for emitted compounds. The AR6 has extended this by assessing the emission-based effective 
radiative forcings (ERFs) also accounting for aerosol–cloud interactions. The best estimates of ERF 
attributed to sulphur dioxide (SO2) and CH4 emissions are substantially greater than in AR5, while 
that of black carbon is substantially reduced. The magnitude of uncertainty in the ERF due to black 
carbon emissions has also been reduced relative to AR5. 
- Global water cycle: The AR5 assessed that anthropogenic influences have likely affected the global 
water cycle since 1960. The dedicated chapter in the AR6 WGI (Chapter 8) concludes with high 
confidence that human-caused climate change has driven detectable changes in the global water 
cycle since the mid-20th century, with a better understanding of the response to aerosol and 
greenhouse gas changes. The AR6 WGI further projects with high confidence an increase in the 
variability of the water cycle in most regions of the world and under all emissions scenarios (Box 
TS.6)  
- Extreme events: The AR5 assessed that human influence had been detected in changes in some 
climate extremes. A dedicated chapter in the AR6 (Chapter 11) concludes that it is now an 
established fact that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions have led to an increased frequency 
and/or intensity of some weather and climate extremes since 1850, in particular for temperature 
extremes. Evidence of observed changes and attribution to human influence has strengthened for 
several types of extremes since AR5, in particular for extreme precipitation, droughts, tropical 
cyclones and compound extremes (including fire weather). (TS.1.2, TS.2.1)  

## Selected Updates and/or New Results Since AR5 and SR1.5 
- Timing of crossing 1.5°C global warming: Slightly different approaches are used in SR1.5 and in 
this Report. SR1.5 assessed a likely range of 2030 to 2052 for reaching a global warming level of 1.5°C (for a 30-year period), assuming a continued, constant rate of warming. In AR6, combining 
the larger estimate of global warming to date and the assessed climate response to all considered 
scenarios, the central estimate of crossing 1.5°C of global warming (for a 20-year period) occurs in 
the early 2030s, ten years earlier than the midpoint of the likely range assessed in the SR1.5, 
assuming no major volcanic eruption. (TS.1.3, Cross-Section Box TS.1) 
- Remaining carbon budgets: The AR5 had assessed the transient climate response to cumulative 
emissions of CO2 to be likely in the range of 0.8°C to 2.5°C per 1000 GtC (1 GtC = 1 PgC = 3.667 
GtCO2), and this was also used in SR1.5. The assessment in AR6, based on multiple lines of 
evidence, leads to a narrower likely range of 1.0°C–2.3°C per 1000 GtC. This has been incorporated 
in updated estimates of remaining carbon budgets (see TS.3.3.1), together with methodological 
improvements and recent observations. (TS.1.3, TS.3.3) 
- Effect of short-lived climate forcers on global warming in coming decades: The SR1.5 stated 
that reductions in emissions of cooling aerosols partially offset greenhouse gas mitigation effects for 
two to three decades in pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C. The AR6 assessment updates the 
AR5 assessment of the net cooling effect of aerosols and confirms that changes in short-lived 
climate forcers will very likely cause further warming in the next two decades across all scenarios 
(TS.1.3, Box TS.7) 
- COVID-19: Temporary emission reductions in 2020 associated with COVID-19 containment led to 
small and positive net radiative effect (warming influence). However, global and regional climate 
responses to this forcing are undetectable above internal climate variability due to the temporary 
nature of emission reductions. (TS.3.3) 

## Selected Updates and/or New Results Since AR5, SRCCL and SROCC 

- Atmospheric concentration of methane: SRCCL reported a resumption of atmospheric methane 
concentration growth since 2007. WGI AR6 reports a faster growth over 2014–2019 and assesses 
growth since 2007 to be largely driven by emissions from the fossil fuels and agriculture (dominated 
by livestock) sectors. (TS.2.2) 
- Land and ocean carbon sinks: SRCCL assessed that the persistence of the land carbon sink is 
uncertain due to climate change. WGI AR6 finds that land and ocean carbon sinks are projected to 
continue to grow until 2100 with increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO2, but the fraction of 
emissions taken up by land and ocean is expected to decline as the CO2 concentration increases, with 
a much larger uncertainty range for the land sink. AR5, SR1.5 and SRCCL assessed carbon dioxide 
removal options and scenarios. WGI AR6 finds that the carbon cycle response is asymmetric for 
pulse emissions or removals, which means that CO2 emissions would be more effective at raising 
atmospheric CO2 than CO2 removals are at lowering atmospheric CO2. (TS.3.3, Box TS.5) 
- Ocean stratification increase<ref>9</ref>: Refined analyses of available observations in the AR6 lead to a 
reassessment of the rate of increase of the global stratification in the upper 200 m to be double that 
estimated in SROCC from 1970 to 2018. (TS.2.4) 
- Projected ocean oxygen loss: Future subsurface oxygen decline in new projections assessed in WGI 
AR6 is substantially greater in 2080–2099 than assessed in SROCC. (TS.2.4) 
- Ice loss from glaciers and ice sheets: since SROCC, globally resolved glacier changes have 
improved estimates of glacier mass loss over the past 20 years, and estimates of the Greenland and 
Antarctic Ice Sheet loss have been extended to 2020. (TS.2.5) 
- Observed global mean sea level change: new observation-based estimates published since SROCC 
lead to an assessed sea level rise estimate from 1901 to 2018 that is now consistent with the sum of 
individual components and consistent with closure of the global energy budget. (Box TS.4)   
- Projected global mean sea level change: AR6 projections of global mean sea level are based on 
projections from ocean thermal expansion and land ice contribution estimates, which are consistent 
with the assessed equilibrium climate sensitivity and assessed changes in global surface temperature. 
They are underpinned by new land ice model intercomparisons and consideration of processes 
associated with low confidence to characterise the deep uncertainty in future ice loss from 
Antarctica. AR6 projections based on new models and methods are broadly consistent with SROCC 
findings. (Box TS.4)   

# TS.1  A Changing Climate 

This section introduces the assessment of the physical science basis of climate change in the AR6 and 
presents the climate context in which this assessment takes place, recent progress in climate science and the 
relevance of global and regional climate information for impact and risk assessments. The future emissions 
scenarios and global warming levels, used to integrate assessments across WGI AR6, are introduced and 
their applications for future climate projections are briefly addressed. Paleoclimate science provides a long-
term context for observed climate change of the past 150 years and the projected changes in the 21st century 
and beyond (Box TS.2). The assessment of past, current and future global surface temperature changes 
relative to the standard baselines and reference periods<ref>10</ref> used throughout this Report is summarized in 
Cross-Section Box TS.1. 
 
 
## TS.1.1  Context of a Changing Climate 
 
AR6 WGI assesses new scientific evidence relevant for a world whose climate system is rapidly changing, 
overwhelmingly due to human influence. The five IPCC assessment cycles since 1990 have comprehensively 
and consistently laid out the rapidly accumulating evidence of a changing climate system, with the Fourth 
Assessment Report (AR4) in 2007 being the first to conclude that warming of the climate system is 
unequivocal. Sustained changes have been documented in all major elements of the climate system: the 
atmosphere, land, cryosphere, biosphere and ocean (TS.2). Multiple lines of evidence indicate the recent 
large-scale climatic changes are unprecedented in a multi-millennial context, and that they represent a 
millennial-scale commitment for the slow-responding elements of the climate system, resulting in continued 
worldwide loss of ice, increase in ocean heat content, sea level rise and deep ocean acidification (Box TS.2; 
Section TS.2). {1.2.1, 1.3, Box 1.2, 2.2, 2.3, Figure 2.34, 5.1, 5.3, 9.2, 9.4-9.6, Appendix 1.A} 

Earth’s climate system has evolved over many millions of years, and evidence from natural archives 
provides a long-term perspective on observed and projected changes over the coming centuries. These 
reconstructions of past climate also show that atmospheric CO2 concentrations and global surface 
temperature are strongly coupled (Figure TS.1), based on evidence from a variety of proxy records over 
multiple time scales (Box TS.2; TS.2). Levels of global warming (see Core Concepts Box) that have not 
been seen in millions of years could be reached by 2300, depending on the emissions pathway that is 
followed (TS.1.3). For example, there is medium confidence that, by 2300, an intermediate scenario<ref>11</ref> used in 
the report leads to global surface temperatures of 2.3°C–4.6°C higher than 1850–1900, similar to the mid-
Pliocene Warm Period (2.5°C–4°C), about 3.2 million years ago, whereas the high CO2 emissions scenario 
SSP5-8.5 leads to temperatures of 6.6°C–14.1°C by 2300, which overlaps with the Early Eocene Climate 
Optimum (10°C–18°C), about 50 million years ago. {Cross-Chapter Box 2.1 and 2.4, 2.3.1, 4.3.1.1, 4.7.1.2, 
7.4.4.1} 
 
<figref>TS.1</figref>
 
Understanding of the climate system’s fundamental elements is robust and well established. Scientists in the 
19th century identified the major natural factors influencing the climate system. They also hypothesized the 
potential for anthropogenic climate change due to carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by combustion of fossil 
fuels (petroleum, coal, natural gas). The principal natural drivers of climate change, including changes in 
incoming solar radiation, volcanic activity, orbital cycles, and changes in global biogeochemical cycles, have 
been studied systematically since the early 20th century. Other major anthropogenic drivers, such as 
atmospheric aerosols (fine solid particles or liquid droplets), land-use change and non-CO2 greenhouse 
gases, were identified by the 1970s. Since systematic scientific assessments began in the 1970s, the influence 
of human activity on the warming of the climate system has evolved from theory to established fact (see also 
TS.2). The evidence for human influence on recent climate change strengthened from the IPCC First 
Assessment Report in 1990 to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report in 2013/14, and is now even stronger in 
this assessment (TS.1.2.4, TS.2). Changes across a greater number of climate system components, including 
changes in regional climate and extremes can now be attributed to human influence (see TS.2 and TS.4). 
{1.3.1 - 1.3.5, 3.1, 11.2, 11.9} 
 
## TS.1.2  Progress in Climate Science  
 
### TS.1.2.1  Observation-based products and their assessments 
 
Observational capabilities have continued to improve and expand overall since AR5, enabling improved 
consistency between independent estimates of climate drivers, the combined climate feedbacks, and the 
observed energy and sea level increase. Satellite climate records and improved reanalyses are used as an 
additional line of evidence for assessing changes at the global and regional scales. However, there have also 
been reductions in some observational data coverage or continuity and limited access to data resulting from 
data policy issues. Natural archives of past climate, such as tropical glaciers, have also been subject to losses 
(in part due to anthropogenic climate change). {1.5.1, 1.5.2, 10.2.2} 
 
Earth system observations are an essential driver of progress in our understanding of climate change. 
Overall, capabilities to observe the physical climate system have continued to improve and expand. 
Improvements are particularly evident in ocean observing networks and remote sensing systems. Records 
from several recently instigated satellite measurement techniques are now long enough to be relevant for 
climate assessments. For example, globally distributed, high-vertical-resolution profiles of temperature and 
humidity in the upper troposphere and stratosphere can be obtained from the early 2000s using global 
navigation satellite systems, leading to updated estimates of recent atmospheric warming. Improved 
measurements of ocean heat content, warming of the land surface, ice sheet mass loss, and sea level changes 
allow a better closure of the global energy and sea level budgets relative to AR5. For surface and balloon-
based networks, apparent regional data reductions result from a combination of data policy issues, data 
curation/provision challenges, and real cessation of observations, and are to an extent counter-balanced by 
improvements elsewhere. Limited observational records of extreme events and spatial data gaps currently 
limit the assessment of some observed regional climate change. {1.5.1, 2.3.2, 7.2.2, Box 7.2, Cross-Chapter 
Box 9.1, 9.6.1, 10.2.2, 10.6, 11.2, 12.4} 
 
New paleoclimate reconstructions from natural archives have enabled more robust reconstructions of the 
spatial and temporal patterns of past climate changes over multiple time scales (Box TS.2). However, 
paleoclimate archives, such as tropical glaciers and modern natural archives used for calibration (e.g., corals 
and trees), are rapidly disappearing owing to a host of pressures, including increasing temperatures (high 
confidence). Substantial quantities of past instrumental observations of weather and other climate variables, 
over both land and ocean, which could fill gaps in existing datasets, remain un-digitized or inaccessible. 
These include measurements of temperature (air and sea surface), rainfall, surface pressure, wind strength 
and direction, sunshine amount and many other variables dating back into the 19th century. {1.5.1} 
 
Reanalyses combine observations and models (e.g., a numerical weather prediction model) using data 
assimilation techniques to provide a spatially complete, dynamically consistent estimate of multiple variables 
describing the evolving climate state. Since AR5, new reanalyses have been developed for the atmosphere 
and the ocean with various combinations of increased resolution, extended records, more consistent data 
assimilation and larger availability of uncertainty estimates. Limitations remain, for example, in how 
reanalyses represent global-scale changes to the water cycle. Regional reanalyses use high-resolution, 
limited-area models constrained by regional observations and with boundary conditions from global 
reanalyses. There is high confidence that regional reanalyses better represent the frequencies of extremes and 
variability in precipitation, surface air temperature and surface wind than global reanalyses and provide 
estimates that are more consistent with independent observations than dynamical downscaling approaches. 
{1.5.2, 10.2.1.2, Annex I} 
 
### TS.1.2.2  Climate Model Performance 

Developments in the latest generation CMIP6 climate and Earth system models, including new and better 
representation of physical, chemical and biological processes, as well as higher resolution, have improved 
the simulation of the recent mean climate of most large-scale indicators of climate change (high confidence, 
Figure TS.2) and many other aspects across the Earth system. Projections of the increase in global surface 
temperature, the pattern of warming, and global mean sea level rise from previous IPCC Assessment Reports 
and other studies are broadly consistent with subsequent observations, especially when accounting for the 
difference in radiative forcing scenarios used for making projections and the radiative forcings that actually 
occurred. While past warming is well simulated by the new generation of models, some individual models 
simulate past surface warming that is either below or above that observed. The information about how well 
models simulate past warming, as well as other insights from observations and theory, are used to assess 
projections of global warming. (see Cross-Section Box TS.1). Increasing horizontal resolution in global 
climate models improves the representation of small-scale features and the statistics of daily precipitation 
(high confidence). Earth system models, which include additional biogeochemical feedbacks, often perform 
as well as their lower-complexity global climate model counterparts, which do not account for these 
additional feedbacks (medium confidence). {1.3.6, 1.5.3, 3.1, 3.5.1, 3.8.2, 4.3.1, 4.3.4, 7.5, 8.5.1, 9.6.3.1}  
 
Climate model simulations coordinated and collected as part of the World Climate Research Programme’s 
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), complemented by a range of results from the 
previous phase (CMIP5), constitute a key line of evidence supporting this Report. The latest generation of 
CMIP6 models have an improved representation of physical processes relative to previous generations, and a 
wider range of Earth system models now represent biogeochemical cycles. Higher-resolution models that 
better capture smaller-scale processes are also increasingly becoming available for climate change research 
(Figure TS.2, Panels a and b). Results from coordinated regional climate modelling initiatives, such as the 
Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) complement and add value to the 
CMIP global models, particularly in complex topography zones, coastal areas and small islands, as well as 
for extremes. {1.5.3, 1.5.4, 6.2.1.2, 6.3.6, 8.5.1, 10.3.3, Atlas.1.4} 
 
Projections of the increase in global surface temperature and the pattern of warming from previous IPCC 
Assessment Reports and other studies are broadly consistent with subsequent observations (limited evidence, 
high agreement), especially when accounting for the difference in radiative forcing scenarios used for 
making projections and the radiative forcings that actually occurred. The AR5 and the SROCC projections of 
GMSL for the 2007–2018 period have been shown to be consistent with observed trends in GMSL and 
regional weighted mean tide gauges. {1.3.6, 9.6.3.1, Figure TS.3} 
 
For most large-scale indicators of climate change, the simulated recent mean climate from CMIP6 models 
underpinning this assessment have improved compared to the CMIP5 models used in AR5 (high confidence). 
This is evident from the performance of 18 simulated atmospheric and land large-scale indicators of climate 
change between the three generations of models (CMIP3, CMIP5, and CMIP6) when benchmarked against 
reanalysis and observational data (Figure TS.2, Panel c). Earth system models, characterized by additional 
biogeochemical feedbacks, often perform at least as well as related, more constrained, lower-complexity 
models lacking these feedbacks (medium confidence). {3.8.2, 10.3.3.3} 

The CMIP6 multi-model mean global surface temperature change from 1850–1900 to 2010–2019 is close to 
the best estimate of the observed warming. However, some CMIP6 models simulate a warming that is below 
or above the assessed very likely range. The CMIP6 models also reproduce surface temperature variations 
over the past millennium, including the cooling that follows periods of intense volcanism (medium 
confidence). For upper air temperature, an overestimation of the upper tropical troposphere warming by 
about 0.1°C per decade between 1979 and 2014 persists in most CMIP5 and CMIP6 models (medium 
confidence), whereas the differences between simulated and improved satellite-derived estimates of change 
in global mean temperature through the depth of the stratosphere have decreased. {3.3.1} 

Some CMIP6 models demonstrate an improvement in how clouds are represented. CMIP5 models 
commonly displayed a negative shortwave cloud radiative effect that was too weak in the present climate. 
These errors have been reduced, especially over the Southern Ocean, due to a more realistic simulation of 
supercooled liquid droplets with sufficient numbers and an associated increase in the cloud optical depth. 
Because a negative cloud optical depth feedback in response to surface warming results from ‘brightening’ 
of clouds via active phase change from ice to liquid cloud particles (increasing their shortwave cloud 
radiative effect), the extratropical cloud shortwave feedback in CMIP6 models tends to be less negative, 
leading to a better agreement with observational estimates (medium confidence). CMIP6 models generally 
represent more processes that drive aerosol–cloud interactions than the previous generation of climate 
models, but there is only medium confidence that those enhancements improve their fitness-for-purpose of 
simulating radiative forcing of aerosol–cloud interactions. {7.4.2, FAQ 7.2, 6.4} 
 
CMIP6 models still have deficiencies in simulating precipitation patterns, particularly in the tropical ocean. 
Increasing horizontal resolution in global climate models improves the representation of small-scale features 
and the statistics of daily precipitation (high confidence). There is high confidence that high-resolution 
global, regional and hydrological models provide a better representation of land surfaces, including 
topography, vegetation and land-use change, which can improve the accuracy of simulations of regional 
changes in the terrestrial water cycle. {3.3.2, 8.5.1, 10.3.3, 11.2.3} 
 
There is high confidence that climate models can reproduce the recent observed mean state and overall 
warming of temperature extremes globally and in most regions, although the magnitude of the trends may 
differ. There is high confidence in the ability of models to capture the large-scale spatial distribution of 
precipitation extremes over land. The overall performance of CMIP6 models in simulating the intensity and 
frequency of extreme precipitation is similar to that of CMIP5 models (high confidence). {Cross-Chapter 
Box 3.2, 11.3.3, 11.4.3} 
 
The structure and magnitude of multi-model mean ocean temperature biases have not changed substantially 
between CMIP5 and CMIP6 (medium confidence). Since AR5, there is improved consistency between recent 
observed estimates and model simulations of changes in upper (<700 m) ocean heat content. The mean zonal 
and overturning circulations of the Southern Ocean and the mean overturning circulation of the North 
Atlantic (AMOC) are broadly reproduced by CMIP5 and CMIP6 models. {3.5.1, 3.5.4, 9.2.3, 9.3.2, 9.4.2} 
 
CMIP6 models better simulate the sensitivity of Arctic sea ice area to anthropogenic CO2 emissions, and 
thus better capture the time evolution of the satellite-observed Arctic sea ice loss (high confidence). The 
ability to model ice-sheet processes has improved substantially since AR5. As a consequence, we have 
medium confidence in the representation of key processes related to surface-mass balance and retreat of the 
grounding-line (the junction between a grounded ice sheet and an ice shelf, where the ice starts to float) in 
the absence of instabilities. However, there remains low confidence in simulations of ice-sheet instabilities, 
ice-shelf disintegration and basal melting owing to their high sensitivity to both uncertain oceanic forcing 
and uncertain boundary conditions and parameters. {1.5.3, 2.3.2, 3.4.1, 3.4.2, 3.8.2, 9.3.1, 9.3.2, 9.4.1, 9.4.2} 
 
CMIP6 models are able to reproduce most aspects of the spatial structure and variance of the El Niño-
Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Basin and Dipole modes of variability (medium confidence). 
However, despite a slight improvement in CMIP6, some underlying processes are still poorly represented. 
Models reproduce observed spatial features and variance of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and 
Northern Annular Modes (NAM) very well (high confidence). The summertime SAM trend is well captured, 
with CMIP6 models outperforming CMIP5 models (medium confidence). By contrast, the cause of the 
Northern Annular Mode (NAM) trend towards its positive phase is not well understood. In the Tropical 
Atlantic basin, which contains the Atlantic Zonal and Meridional modes, major biases in modelled mean 
state and variability remain. Model performance is limited in reproducing sea surface temperature anomalies 
for decadal modes of variability, despite improvements from CMIP5 to CMIP6 (medium confidence) (see 
also TS.1.4.2.2, Table TS.4). {3.7.3-3.7.7}  
 
Earth system models simulate globally averaged land carbon sinks within the range of observation-based 
estimates (high confidence), but global-scale agreement masks large regional disagreements. There is also 
high confidence that the ESMs simulate the weakening of the global net flux of CO2 into the ocean during 
the 1990s, as well as the strengthening of the flux from 2000. {3.6.1, 3.6.2}  
  
Two important quantities used to estimate how the climate system responds to changes in GHG 
concentrations are the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and transient climate response (TCR<ref>13</ref>). The 
CMIP6 ensemble has broader ranges of ECS and TCR values than CMIP5 (see TS.3.2 for the assessed 
range). These higher sensitivity values can, in some models, be traced to changes in extratropical cloud 
feedbacks (medium confidence). To combine evidence from CMIP6 models and independent assessments of 
ECS and TCR, various emulators are used throughout the report. Emulators are a broad class of simple 
climate models or statistical methods that reproduce the behaviour of complex ESMs to represent key 
characteristics of the climate system, such as global surface temperature and sea level projections. The main 
application of emulators in AR6 is to extrapolate insights from ESMs and observational constraints to 
produce projections from a larger set of emissions scenarios, which is achieved due to their computational 
efficiency. These emulated projections are also used for scenario classification in WGIII. {Box 4.1, 4.3.4., 
7.4.2, 7.5.6, CCB7.1, FAQ7.2}

### TS.1.2.3  Understanding Climate Variability and Emerging Changes 
 

Observed changes in climate are unequivocal at the global scale and are increasingly apparent on regional 
and local spatial scales. Both the rate of long-term change and the amplitude of year-to-year variations differ 
between regions and across climate variables, thus influencing when changes emerge or become apparent 
compared to natural variations (see Core Concepts Box). The signal of temperature change has emerged 
more clearly in tropical regions, where year-to-year variations tend to be small over land, than in regions 
with greater warming but larger year-to-year variations (high confidence) (Figure TS.3). Long-term changes 
in other variables have emerged in many regions, such as for some weather and climate extremes and Arctic 
sea ice area. {1.4.2, Cross-Chapter Box 3.1, 9.3.1, 11.3.2, 12.5.2} 

Observational datasets have been extended and improved since AR5, providing stronger evidence that the 
climate is changing and allowing better estimates of natural climate variability on decadal time scales. There 
is very high confidence that the slower rate of global surface temperature change observed over 1998–2012 
compared to 1951–2012 was temporary, and was, with high confidence, induced by internal variability 
(particularly Pacific Decadal Variability) and variations in solar irradiance and volcanic forcing that partly 
offset the anthropogenic warming over this period. Global ocean heat content continued to increase 
throughout this period, indicating continuous warming of the entire climate system (very high confidence). 
Hot extremes also continued to increase during this period over land (high confidence). Even in a continually 
warming climate, periods of reduced and increased trends in global surface temperature at decadal time 
scales will continue to occur in the 21st century (very high confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 3.1, 3.3.1, 3.5.1, 
4.6.2, 11.3.2} 
 
Since AR5, the increased use of ‘large ensembles’, or multiple simulations with the same climate model but 
using different initial conditions, supports improved understanding of the relative roles of internal variability 
and forced change in the climate system. Simulations and understanding of modes of climate variability, 
including teleconnections, have improved since AR5 (medium confidence), and larger ensembles allow a 
better quantification of uncertainty in projections due to internal climate variability. {1.4.2, 1.5.3, 1.5.4, 4.2, 
Box 4.1, 4.4.1, 8.5.2, 10.3.4, 10.4} 
 
Changes in regional climate can be detected even though natural climate variations can temporarily increase 
or obscure anthropogenic climate change on decadal time scales. While anthropogenic forcing has 
contributed to multi-decadal mean precipitation changes in several regions, internal variability can delay 
emergence of the anthropogenic signal in long-term precipitation changes in many land regions (high 
confidence). {10.4.1, 10.4.2, 10.4.3} 
 
Mean temperatures and heat extremes have emerged above natural variability in almost all land regions with 
high confidence. Changes in temperature-related variables, such as regional temperatures, growing season 
length, extreme heat and frost, have already occurred, and there is medium confidence that many of these 
changes are attributable to human activities. Several impact-relevant changes have not yet emerged from the 
natural variability but will emerge sooner or later in this century depending on the emissions scenario (high 
confidence). Ocean acidification and deoxygenation have already emerged over most of the global open 
ocean, as has a reduction in Arctic sea ice (high confidence). {9.3.1, 9.6.4, 11.2, 11.3, 12.4, 12.5, Atlas.3-
Atlas.11} 
 
<figref>TS.3</figref>
 
### TS.1.2.4  Understanding of Human Influence 

The evidence for human influence on recent climate change has strengthened progressively from the IPCC 
Second Assessment Report to the AR5 and is even stronger in this assessment, including for regional scales 
and for extremes. Human influence in the IPCC context refers to the human activities that lead to or 
contribute to a climate response, such as the human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases that 
subsequently alter the atmosphere’s radiative properties, resulting in warming of the climate system. Other 
human activities influencing climate include the emission of aerosols and other short-lived climate forcers, 
and land-use change such as urbanisation. Progress in our understanding of human influence is gained from 
longer observational datasets, improved paleoclimate information, a stronger warming signal since AR5, and 
improvements in climate models, physical understanding and attribution techniques (see Core Concepts 
Box). Since AR5, the attribution to human influence has become possible across a wider range of climate 
variables and climatic impact-drivers (CIDs, see Core Concepts Box). New techniques and analyses drawing 
on several lines of evidence have provided greater confidence in attributing changes in regional weather and 
climate extremes to human influence (high confidence). {1.3, 1.5.1, Appendix 1A, 3.1-3.8, 5.2, 6.4.2, 7.3.5, 
7.4.4, 8.3.1, 10.4, Cross-Chapter Box 10.3, 11.2-11.9, 12.4, TS.3} 

Combining the evidence from across the climate system increases the level of confidence in the attribution of 
observed climate change to human influence and reduces the uncertainties associated with assessments based 
on single variables.  
 
Since AR5, the accumulation of energy in the Earth system has become established as a robust measure of 
the rate of global climate change on interannual-to-decadal time scales. The rate of accumulation of energy is 
equivalent to the Earth’s energy imbalance and can be quantified by changes in the global energy inventory 
for all components of the climate system, including global ocean heat uptake, warming of the atmosphere, 
warming of the land, and melting of ice. Compared to changes in global surface temperature, the Earth's 
energy imbalance (see Core Concepts Box) exhibits less variability, enabling more accurate identification 
and estimation of trends. 
 
Identifying the human-induced components contributing to the energy budget provides an implicit estimate 
of the human influence on global climate change. {Cross-Working Group Box: Attribution, 3.8, 7.2.2, Box 
7.2 and Cross Chapter Box 9.1, TS.2, TS.3.1} 
 
Regional climate changes can be moderated or amplified by regional forcing from land use and land-cover 
changes or from aerosol concentrations and other short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs). For example, the 
difference in observed warming trends between cities and their surroundings can partly be attributed to 
urbanization (very high confidence). While established attribution techniques provide confidence in our 
assessment of human influence on large-scale climate changes (as described in TS.2), new techniques 
developed since AR5, including attribution of individual events, have provided greater confidence in 
attributing changes in climate extremes to climate change. Multiple attribution approaches support the 
contribution of human influence to several regional multi-decadal mean precipitation changes (high 
confidence). Understanding about past and future changes in weather and climate extremes has increased due 
to better observation-based datasets, physical understanding of processes, an increasing proportion of 
scientific literature combining different lines of evidence, and improved accessibility to different types of 
climate models (high confidence) (see TS.2, TS.4). {Cross-Working Group Box: Attribution, 1.5, 3.2, 3.5, 
5.2, 6.4.3, 8.3, 9.6, 10.1, 10.2, 10.3.3, 10.4.1, 10.4.2, 10.4.3, 10.5, 10.6, Cross-Chapter Box 10.3, Box 10.3, 
11.1.6, 11.2-11.9, 12.4}. 
 
## TS.1.3  Assessing Future Climate Change  
 
Various frameworks can be used to assess future climatic changes and to synthesize knowledge across 
climate change assessment in WGI, WGII and WGIII. These frameworks include: (i) scenarios, (ii) global 
warming levels and (iii) cumulative CO2 emissions (see Core Concepts Box). The latter two offer scenario- 
and path-independent approaches to assess future projections. Additional choices, for instance with regard to 
common reference periods and time windows for which changes are assessed, can further help to facilitate 
integration across the WGI report and across the whole AR6 (see TS.1.1). {1.4.1, 1.6, Cross-Chapter Box 
1.4, 4.2.2, 4.2.4, Cross-Chapter Box 11.1} 
 
 
### TS.1.3.1  Climate Change Scenarios  
 
A core set of five scenarios based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) are used consistently 
across this report: SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5. These scenarios cover a broader 
range of greenhouse gas and air pollutant futures than assessed in earlier WGI reports, and they include high-
CO2 emissions pathways without climate change mitigation as well as new low-CO2 emissions pathways 
(Figure TS.4). In these scenarios, differences in air pollution control and variations in climate change 
mitigation stringency strongly affect anthropogenic emission trajectories of SLCFs. Modelling studies 
relying on the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) used in the AR5 complement the assessment 
based on SSP scenarios, for example at the regional scale. A comparison of simulations from CMIP5 using 
the RCPs with SSP-based simulations from CMIP6 shows that about half of the increase in simulated 
warming in CMIP6 versus CMIP5 arises because higher climate sensitivity is more prevalent in CMIP6 
model versions; the other half arises from higher radiative forcing in nominally corresponding scenarios 
(e.g., RCP8.5 and SSP5-8.5; medium confidence). The feasibility or likelihood of individual scenarios is not 
part of this assessment, which focuses on the climate response to a large range of emissions scenarios. 
{1.5.4, 1.6, Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, 4.2, 4.3, 4.6, 6.6, 6.7, Cross-Chapter Box 7.1, Atlas.2.1} 
 
Climate change projections with climate models require information about future emissions or 
concentrations of greenhouse gases, aerosols, ozone depleting substances, and land use over time (Figure 
TS.4). This information can be provided by scenarios, which are internally consistent projections of these 
quantities based on assumptions of how socio-economic systems could evolve over the 21st century. 
Emissions from natural sources, such as the ocean and the land biosphere, are usually assumed to be 
constant, or to evolve in response to changes in anthropogenic forcings or to projected climate change. 
Natural forcings, such as past changes in solar irradiance and historical volcanic eruptions, are represented in 
model simulations covering the historical era. Future simulations assessed in this report account for projected 
changes in solar irradiance and for the long-term mean background forcing from volcanoes, but not for 
individual volcanic eruptions. Scenarios have a long history in IPCC as a method for systematically 
examining possible futures and allow to follow the cause-effect chain: from anthropogenic emissions, to 
changes in atmospheric concentrations, to changes in the Earth’ energy balance (‘forcing’), to changes in 
global climate and ultimately regional climate and climatic impact-drivers (Figure TS.4; see TS.2; 
Infographic TS.1). {1.5.4, 1.6.1, 4.2.2, 4.4.4, Cross-Chapter Box 4.1, 11.1}  
 
<figref>TS.4</figref>

The uncertainty in climate change projections that results from assessing alternative socio-economic futures, 
the so-called scenario uncertainty, is explored through the use of scenario sets. Designed to span a wide 
range of possible future conditions, these scenarios do not intend to match how events actually unfold in the 
future, and they do not account for impacts of climate change on the socio-economic pathways. Besides 
scenario uncertainty, climate change projections are also subject to climate response uncertainty (i.e., the 
uncertainty related to our understanding of the key physical processes and structural uncertainties in climate 
models) and irreducible and intrinsic uncertainties related to internal variability. Depending on the spatial 
and temporal scales of the projection, and on the variable of interest, the relative importance of these 
different uncertainties may vary substantially. {1.4.3, 1.6, 4.2.5, Box 4.1, 8.5.1} 
 
In this report, a core set of five scenarios is used to explore climate change over the 21st century and beyond 
(Section TS.2). They are labelled SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5<ref>14</ref>, and span a wide 
range of radiative forcing levels in 2100. Scenarios in AR6 cover a broader range of emissions futures than 
considered in AR5, including high CO2 emissions scenarios without climate change mitigation as well as a 
low CO2 emissions scenario reaching net zero CO2 emissions (see Core Concepts Box) around mid-century. 
These SSP scenarios offer unprecedented detail of input data for ESM simulations and allow for a more 
comprehensive assessment of climate drivers and responses, in particular because some aspects, such as the 
temporal evolution of pollutants, emissions or changes in land use and land cover, span a broader range in 
the SSP scenarios than in the RCPs used in the AR5. Modelling studies utilizing the RCPs complement the 
assessment based on SSP scenarios, for example, at the regional scale (Section TS.4). Scenario extensions 
are based on assumptions about the post-2100 evolution of emissions or of radiative forcing that is 
independent from the modelling of socio-economic dynamics, which does not extend beyond 2100. To 
explore specific dimensions, such as air pollution or temporary overshoot of a given warming level, scenario 
variants are used in addition to the core set. {1.6.1, Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, 4.2.2, 4.2.6, 4.7.1, Cross-Chapter 
Box 7.1} 
 
SSP1-1.9 represents the low end of future emissions pathways, leading to warming below 1.5°C in 2100 and 
limited temperature overshoot over the course of the 21st century (see Figure TS.6). At the opposite end of 
the range, SSP5-8.5 represents the very high warming end of future emissions pathways from the literature. 
SSP3-7.0 has overall lower GHG emissions than SSP5-8.5 but, for example, CO2 emissions still almost 
double by 2100 compared to today’s levels. SSP2-4.5 and SSP1-2.6 represent scenarios with stronger 
climate change mitigation and thus lower GHG emissions. SSP1-2.6 was designed to limit warming to below 
2°C. Infographic TS.1 presents a narrative depiction of SSP-related climate futures. No likelihood is attached 
to the scenarios assessed in this report, and the feasibility of specific scenarios in relation to current trends is 
best informed by the WGIII contribution to AR6. In the scenario literature, the plausibility of some scenarios 
with high CO2 emissions, such as RCP8.5 or SSP5-8.5, has been debated in light of recent developments in 
the energy sector. However, climate projections from these scenarios can still be valuable because the 
concentration-levels reached in RCP8.5 or SSP5-8.5 and corresponding simulated climate futures cannot be 
ruled out. That is because of uncertainty in carbon-cycle feedbacks which in nominally lower emissions 
trajectories can result in projected concentrations that are higher than the central concentration-levels 
typically used to drive model projections {1.6.1; Cross-Chapter Box 1.4; 4.2.2, 5.4; SROCC; Chapter 3 in 
WGIII}. 
 
The socio-economic narratives underlying SSP-based scenarios differ in their assumed level of air pollution 
control. Together with variations in climate change mitigation stringency, this difference strongly affects 
anthropogenic emission trajectories of SLCFs, some of which are also air pollutants. SSP1 and SSP5 assume 
strong pollution control, projecting a decline of global emissions of ozone precursors (except methane) and 
of aerosols and most of their precursors in the mid- to long term. The reductions due to air pollution controls 
are further strengthened in scenarios that assume a marked decarbonization, such as SSP1-1.9 or SSP1-2.6. 
SSP2-4.5 is a medium pollution-control scenario with air pollutant emissions following current trends, and 
SSP3-7.0 is a weak pollution-control scenario with strong increases in emissions of air pollutants over the 
21st century. Methane emissions in SSP-based scenarios vary with the overall climate change mitigation 
stringency, declining rapidly in SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 but declining only after 2070 in SSP5-8.5. SSP 
trajectories span a wider range of air pollutant emissions than considered in the RCP scenarios (see Figure 
TS.4), reflecting the potential for large regional differences in their assumed pollution policies. Their effects 
on climate and air pollution are assessed in Box TS.7. {4.4.4, 6.6.1, Figure 6.4; 6.7.1, Figure 6.19} 
 
Since the RCPs are also labelled by the level of radiative forcing they reach in 2100, they can in principle be 
related to the core set of AR6 scenarios (Figure TS.4). However, the RCPs and SSP-based scenarios are not 
directly comparable. First, the gas-to-gas compositions differ; for example, the SSP5-8.5 scenario has higher 
CO2 but lower methane concentrations compared to RCP8.5. Second, the projected 21st-century trajectories 
may differ, even if they result in the same radiative forcing by 2100. Third, the overall effective radiative 
forcing (see Core Concepts Box) may differ, and tends to be higher for the SSPs compared to RCPs that 
share the same nominal stratospheric-temperature-adjusted radiative forcing label. Comparing the 
differences between CMIP5 and CMIP6 projections (Cross-Section Box TS.1) that were driven by RCPs and 
SSP-based scenarios, respectively, indicates that about half of the difference in simulated warming arises 
because of higher climate sensitivity being more prevalent in CMIP6 model versions; the remainder arises 
from higher ERF in nominally corresponding scenarios (e.g., RCP8.5 and SSP5-8.5; medium confidence) 
(see TS.1.2.2). In SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5, changes in effective radiative forcing also explain about half of 
the changes in the range of warming (medium confidence). For SSP5-8.5, higher climate sensitivity is the 
primary reason behind the upper end of the CMIP6-projected warming being higher than for RCP8.5 in 
CMIP5 (medium confidence). Note that AR6 uses multiple lines of evidence beyond CMIP6 results to assess 
global surface temperature under various scenarios (see Cross-Section Box TS.1 for the detailed assessment). 
{1.6, 4.2.2, 4.6.2.2, Cross-Chapter Box 7.1} 
 
Earth system models can be driven by anthropogenic CO2 emission (‘emissions-driven’ runs), in which case 
atmospheric CO2 concentration is a projected variable; or by prescribed time-varying atmospheric 
concentrations (‘concentration-driven’ runs). In emissions-driven runs, changes in climate feed back on the 
carbon cycle and interactively modify the projected CO2 concentration in each ESM, thus adding the 
uncertainty in the carbon cycle response to climate change to the projections. Concentration-driven 
simulations are based on a central estimate of carbon cycle feedbacks, while emissions-driven simulations 
help quantify the role of feedback uncertainty. The differences in the few ESMs for which both emission and 
concentration-driven runs were available for the same scenario are small and do not affect the assessment of 
global surface temperature projections discussed in Cross-Section Box TS.1 and Section TS.2 (high 
confidence). By the end of the 21st century, emission-driven simulations are on average around 0.1°C cooler 
than concentration-driven runs reflecting the generally lower CO2 concentrations simulated by the emission 
driven ESMs, and a spread about 0.1°C greater reflecting the range of simulated CO2 concentrations. 
However, these carbon cycle–climate feedbacks do affect the transient climate response to cumulative CO2 
emissions (TCRE<ref>15</ref>), and their quantification is crucial for the assessment of remaining carbon budgets 
consistent with global warming levels simulated by ESMs (see TS.3). {1.6.1, Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, 4.2, 
4.3.1, 5.4.5, Cross-Chapter Box 7.1} 
 

### TS.1.3.2  Global Warming Levels and Cumulative CO2 Emissions 
 
Quantifying geographical response patterns of climate change at various global warming levels (GWLs), 
such as 1.5 or 2°C above the 1850–1900 period, is useful for characterizing changes in mean climate, 
extremes and climatic impact-drivers. GWLs are used in this report as a dimension of integration 
independent of the timing when the warming level is reached and of the emissions scenario that led to the 
warming. For many climate variables the response pattern for a given GWL is consistent across different 
scenarios. However, this is not the case for slowly responding processes, such as ice sheet and glacier mass 
loss, deep ocean warming, and the related sea level rise. The response of these variables depends on the time 
it takes to reach the GWL, differs if the warming is reached in a transient warming state or after a temporary 
overshoot of the warming level, and will continue to evolve, over centuries to millennia, even after global 
warming has stabilized. Different GWLs correspond closely to specific cumulative CO2 emissions due to 
their near-linear relationship with global surface temperature. This report uses 1.0°C, 1.5°C, 2.0°C, 3.0°C, 
and 4.0°C above 1850–1900 conditions as a primary set of GWLs. {1.6.2, 4.2.4, 4.6.1, 5.5, Cross-Chapter 
Box 11.1, Cross-chapter Box 12.1} 

For many indicators of climate change, such as seasonal and annual mean and extreme surface air 
temperatures and precipitation, the geographical patterns of changes are well estimated by the level of global 
surface warming, independently of the details of the emission pathways that caused the warming, or the time 
at which the level of warming is attained. GWLs, defined as a global surface temperature increase of, for 
example, 1.5°C or 2°C relative to the mean of 1850–1900, are therefore a useful way to integrate climate 
information independently of specific scenarios or time periods. {1.6.2, 4.2.4, 4.6.1, 11.2.4, Cross-Chapter 
Box 11.1} 
 
The use of GWLs allows disentangling the contribution of changes in global warming from regional aspects 
of the climate response, as scenario differences in response patterns at a given GWL are often smaller than 
model uncertainty and internal variability. The relationship between the GWL and response patterns is often 
linear, but integration of information can also be done for non-linear changes, like the frequency of heat 
extremes. The requirement is that the relationship to the GWL is broadly independent of the scenario and 
relative contribution of radiative forcing agents. {1.6, 11.2.4, Cross-Chapter Box 11.1} 
 
The GWL approach to integration of climate information also has some limitations. Variables that are quick 
to respond to warming, like temperature and precipitation, including extremes, sea ice area, permafrost and 
snow cover, show little scenario dependence for a given GWL, whereas slow-responding variables such as 
glacier and ice sheet mass, warming of the deep ocean and their contributions to sea level rise, have 
substantial dependency on the trajectory of warming taken to reach the GWL. A given GWL can also be 
reached for different balances between anthropogenic forcing agents, such as long-lived greenhouse gas and 
SLCF emissions, and the response patterns may depend on this balance. Finally, there is a difference in the 
response even for temperature-related variables if a GWL is reached in a rapidly warming transient state or 
in an equilibrium state when the land–sea warming contrast is less pronounced. In this Report the climate 
responses at different GWLs are calculated based on climate model projections for the 21st century (see 
Figure TS.5), which are mostly not in equilibrium. The SSP1-1.9 scenario allows assessing the response to a 
GWL of about 1.5°C after a (relatively) short-term stabilization by the end of the 21st century. {4.6.2, 
9.3.1.1, 9.5.2.3, 9.5.3.3, 11.2.4, Cross-Chapter Box 11.1, Cross-chapter Box 12.1} 
 
Global warming levels are highly relevant as a dimension of integration across scientific disciplines and 
socio-economic actors and are motivated by the long-term goal in the Paris Agreement of ‘holding the 
increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts 
to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels’. The evolution of aggregated impacts 
with temperature levels has also been widely used and embedded in the WGII assessment. This includes the 
‘Reasons for Concern’ (RFC) and other ‘burning ember’ diagrams in IPCC WGII. The RFC framework has 
been further expanded in the SR1.5, the SROCC and SRCCL by explicitly looking at the differential impacts 
between half-degree GWLs and the evolution of risk for different socio-economic assumptions. {1.4.4, 1.6.2, 
11.2.4, 12.5.2, Cross-chapter Box 11.1, Cross-Chapter Box 12.1} 
 
SR1.5 concluded, ‘climate models project robust differences in regional climate characteristics between 
present-day and global warming of 1.5°C, and between 1.5°C and 2°C’. This report adopts a set of common 
GWLs across which climate projections, impacts, adaptation challenges and climate change mitigation 
challenges can be integrated, within and across the three WGs, relative to 1850–1900. The core set of GWLs 
in this Report are 1.0°C (close to present day conditions), 1.5°C, 2.0°C, 3.0°C, and 4.0°C. {1.4, 1.6.2, Cross-
Chapter Box 1.2, Table 1.5, Cross-chapter Box 11.1} 
 
#### Connecting Scenarios and Global Warming Levels 
 
In this report, scenario-based climate projections are translated into GWLs by aggregating the ESM model 
response at specific GWL across scenarios (see Figure TS.5 and Figure TS.6). The climate response pattern 
for the 20-year period around when individual simulations reach a given GWL are averaged across all 
models and scenarios that reach that GWL. The best estimate and likely range of the timing of when a certain 
GWL is reached under a particular scenario (or ‘GWL-crossing time’), however, is based not only on CMIP6 
output, but on a combined assessment taking into account the observed warming to date, CMIP6 output and 
additional lines of evidence (see Cross-Section Box TS.1). {4.3.4, Cross-Chapter Box 11.1, Atlas.2, 
Interactive Atlas} 
 
<figref>TS.5</figref>
 
Global warming levels are closely related to cumulative CO2 (and in some cases CO2-equivalent) emissions. 
This report confirms the assessment of the WGI AR5 and SR1.5 that a near-linear relationship exists 
between cumulative CO2 emissions and the resulting increase in global surface temperature (Section TS.3.2). 
This implies that continued CO2 emissions will cause further warming and associated changes in all 
components of the climate system. For declining cumulative CO2 emissions (i.e., if negative net emissions 
are achieved), the relationship is less strong for some components, such as the hydrological cycle. The WGI 
report uses cumulative CO2 emissions to compare climate response across scenarios and provides a link to 
the emission pathways assessment in WGIII. The advantage of using cumulative CO2 emissions is that it is 
an inherent emissions scenario characteristic rather than an outcome of the scenario-based projections, where 
uncertainties in the cause–effect chain from emissions to temperature change are important (Figure TS.4), for 
example, the uncertainty in effective radiative forcing (ERF) and transient climate response (TCR). 
Cumulative CO2 emissions can also provide a link to the assessments of mitigation options. Cumulative CO2 
emissions do not carry information about non-CO2 emissions, although these can be included with specific 
emission metrics to estimate CO2-equivalent emissions. (TS.3.3) {1.3.2, 1.6, 4.6.2, 5.5, 7.6, 8.4.3}  
 
 
## TS.1.4  From Global to Regional Climate Information for Impact and Risk Assessment 

The WGI AR6 has an expanded focus on regional information supported by the increased availability of 
coordinated regional climate model ensemble projections and improvements in the sophistication and 
resolution of global and regional climate models (high confidence). Multiple lines of evidence can be used to 
construct climate information on a global to regional scale and can be further distilled in a co-production 
process to meet user needs (high confidence). To better support risk assessment, a common risk framework 
across all three Working Groups has been implemented in AR6, and low-likelihood but high-impact 
outcomes are explicitly addressed in WGI by using physical climate storylines (see Core Concepts Box). 
Climatic impact-drivers are physical climate system conditions (e.g., means, events, extremes) that affect an 
element of society or ecosystems. They are the WGI contribution to the risk framing without anticipating 
whether their impact provides potential opportunities or is detrimental (i.e., as for hazards). Many global and 
regional climatic impact-drivers have a direct relation to global warming levels (high confidence). {1.4.4, 
1.5.2-1.5.4, 4.8, 10.1, 10.5.1, 11.2.4, 11.9, 12.1-12.3, 12.6, Atlas.1.3.3-1.3.4, Atlas.1.4, Atlas.1.4.4, Boxes 
10.2 and 11.2, Cross-Chapter Boxes 1.3, 10.3, 11.1, 12.1 and 12.2}  

Climate change is a global phenomenon, but manifests differently in different regions. The impacts of 
climate change are generally experienced at local, national and regional scales, and these are also the scales 
at which decisions are typically made. Robust climate change information is increasingly available at 
regional scales for impact and risk assessments. Depending on the climate information context, geographical 
regions in AR6 may refer to larger areas, such as sub-continents and oceanic regions, or to typological 
regions, such as monsoon regions, coastlines, mountain ranges or cities, as used in TS.4. A new set of 
standard AR6 WGI reference regions has also been included in this report (Fig. TS.6 bottom panels). {1.4.5, 
10.1, 11.9, 12.1-12.4, Atlas.1.3.3-1.3.4}  
 
Global and regional climate models are important sources of climate information at the regional scale. Since 
AR5, a more comprehensive assessment of past and future evolution of a range of climate variables on a 
regional scale has been enabled by the increased availability of coordinated ensemble regional climate model 
projections and improvements in the level of sophistication and resolution of global and regional climate 
models. This has been complemented by observational, attribution and sectoral-vulnerability studies 
informing, for instance, about impact-relevant tolerance thresholds. {10.3.3, 11.9, 12.1, 12.3, 12.6, Atlas.3-
Atlas.11, Interactive Atlas} 
 
Multiple lines of evidence derived from observations, model simulations and other approaches can be used to 
construct climate information on a regional scale as described in detail in TS.4.1.1 and TS.4.1.2. Depending 
on the phenomena and specific context, these sources and methodologies include theoretical understanding 
of the relevant processes, drivers and feedbacks of climate at regional scale, trends in observed data from 
multiple datasets, and the attribution of these trends to specific drivers. Furthermore, simulations from 
different model types (including global and regional climate models, emulators, statistical downscaling 
methods, etc.) and experiments (e.g., CMIP, CORDEX, and large ensembles of single-model simulations 
with different initial conditions), attribution methodologies as well as other relevant local knowledge (e.g., 
indigenous knowledge) are utilized. (see Box TS.11). {1.5.3,1.5.4, Cross-Chapter Box 7.1, 10.2,10.3-10.6, 
11.2, Atlas.1.4, Cross-Chapter Box 10.3} 
 
From the multiple lines of evidence, climate information can be distilled in a co-production process that 
involves users, related stakeholders and producers of climate information, considering the specific context of 
the question at stake, the underlying values, and the challenge of communicating across different 
communities. The co-production process is an essential part of climate services, which are discussed in 
TS.4.1.2. {10.5, 12.6, Cross-Chapter Box 12.2} 
 
<figref>TS.6</figref> 
 
With the aim of informing decision-making at local or regional scales, a common risk framework has been 
implemented in AR6. Methodologies have been developed to construct more impact- and risk-relevant 
climate change information tailored to regions and stakeholders. Physical storyline approaches are used in 
order to build climate information based on multiple lines of evidence, and which can explicitly address 
physically plausible, but low-likelihood, high-impact outcomes and uncertainties related to climate 
variability for consideration in risk assessments (see Figure TS.6). {4.8, 12.1-12.3, 12.6, Box 9.4, 10.5, Box 
10.2, Box 11.2, Cross-Chapter Box 1.3, Glossary} 
 
The climatic impact-driver framework developed in AR6 supports an assessment of changing climate 
conditions that are relevant for sectoral impacts and risk assessment. Climatic impact-drivers (CIDs) are 
physical climate system conditions (e.g., means, extremes, events) that affect an element of society or 
ecosystems and are thus a potential priority for providing climate information. For instance, the heat index 
used by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA HI) for issuing heat warnings is 
a CID index that can be associated with adverse human health impacts due to heat stress (see Figure TS.6). 
Depending on system tolerance, CIDs and their changes can be detrimental (i.e., hazards in the risk framing), 
beneficial, neutral, or a mixture of each across interacting system elements, regions and sectors (aligning 
with WGII Sectoral Chapters 2–8). Each sector is affected by multiple CIDs, and each CID affects multiple 
sectors. Climate change has already altered CID profiles and resulted in shifting magnitude, frequency, 
duration, seasonality and spatial extent of associated indices (high confidence) (see regional details in 
TS.4.3). {12.1-12.4, Table 12.1, Table 12.2, Technical Annex VI} 
 
Many global- and regional-scale CIDs, including extremes, have a direct relation to global warming levels 
(GWLs) and can thus inform the hazard component of ‘Representative Key Risks’ and ‘Reasons for 
Concern’ assessed by AR6 WGII. These include heat, cold, wet and dry hazards, both mean and extremes; 
cryospheric hazards (snow cover, ice extent, permafrost) and oceanic hazards (marine heatwaves) (high 
confidence) (Figure TS.6). Establishing links between specific GWLs with tipping points and irreversible 
behaviour is challenging due to model uncertainties and lack of observations, but their occurrence cannot be 
excluded, and their likelihood of occurrence generally increases at greater warming levels (Box TS.1, TS.9).

# TS.2  Large-scale Climate Change: Mean Climate, Variability and Extremes 
 
This section summarizes knowledge about observed and projected large-scale climate change (including 
variability and extremes), drivers and attribution of observed changes to human activities. It describes 
observed and projected large-scale changes associated with major components of the climate system: 
atmosphere, ocean (including sea level change), land, biosphere and cryosphere, and the carbon, energy and 
water cycles. In each subsection, reconstructed past, observed and attributed recent, and projected near- and 
long-term changes to mean climate, variability and extremes are presented, where possible, in an integrated 
way. See TS.1.3.1 for information on the scenarios used for projections.  
 
## TS.2.1  Changes Across the Global Climate System 
 
In addition to global surface temperature (Cross-Section Box TS.1), a wide range of indicators across all 
components of the climate system is changing rapidly (Figure TS.7), with many at levels unseen in 
millennia. The observed changes provide a coherent picture of a warming world, many aspects of which 
have now been formally attributed to human influences, and human influence on the climate system as a 
whole is assessed as unequivocal for the first time in IPCC assessment reports (Table TS.1, Figure TS.7). It 
is virtually certain that global surface temperature rise and associated changes can be limited through rapid 
and substantial reductions in global GHG emissions. Continued GHG emissions greatly increase the 
likelihood of potentially irreversible changes in the global climate system (Box TS.3), in particular with 
respect to the contribution of ice sheets to global sea level change (high confidence). {2.3, 3.8, 4.3, 4.6, 4.7, 
7.2-7.4, 9.2-9.6, CCB 7.1} 
 
Earth system model (ESM) simulations of the historical period since 1850 are only able to reproduce the 
observed changes in key climate indicators when anthropogenic forcings are included (Figure TS.7). Taken 
together with numerous formal attribution studies across an even broader range of indicators and theoretical 
understanding, this underpins the unequivocal attribution of observed warming of the climate system to 
human influence (Table TS.1). {2.3, 3.8} 
 
<figref>TS.7</figref>
<tableref>TS.1</tableref>
 
Future climate change across a range of atmospheric, cryospheric, oceanic and biospheric indicators depends 
upon future emissions pathways. Outcomes for a broad range of indicators increasingly diverge through the 
21st century across the different SSPs (TS.1.3.1; Figure TS.8). Due to the slow response of the deep ocean 
and ice sheets, this divergence continues long after 2100, and 21st century emissions choices will have 
implications for GMSL rise for centuries to millennia. Furthermore, it is likely that at least one large volcanic 
eruption will occur during the 21st century. Such an eruption would reduce global surface temperature for 
several years, decrease land precipitation, alter monsoon circulation and modify extreme precipitation, at 
both global and regional scales. {4.3, 4.7, 9.4, 9.6, Cross-Chapter Box 4.1}  
 
<figref>TS.8</figref>
 
Observational records show changes in a wide range of climate extremes that have been linked to human 
influence on the climate system (Table TS.2). In many cases, the frequency and intensity of future changes in 
extremes can be directly linked to the magnitude of future projected warming. Changes in extremes are 
widespread over land since the 1950s, including a virtually certain global increase in extreme air 
temperatures and a likely intensification in global-scale extreme precipitation. It is extremely likely that 
human influence is the main contributor to the observed increase (decrease) in the likelihood and severity of 
hot (cold) extremes (Table TS.2). The frequency of extreme temperature and precipitation events in the 
current climate will change with warming, with warm extremes becoming more frequent (virtually certain), 
cold extremes becoming less frequent (extremely likely) and precipitation extremes becoming more frequent 
in most locations (very likely). {9.6.4, 11.2, 11,3, 11.4, 11.6, 11.7, 11.8, 11.9, Box 9.2} 
 
<tableref>TS.2</tableref>

## TS.2.2  Changes in the Drivers of the Climate System 
 
Since 1750, changes in the drivers of the climate system are dominated by the warming influence of 
increases in atmospheric GHG concentrations and a cooling influence from aerosols, both resulting from 
human activities. In comparison there has been negligible long-term influence from solar activity and 
volcanoes. Concentrations of CO2, CH4, and N2O have increased to levels unprecedented in at least 800,000 
years, and there is high confidence that current CO2 concentrations have not been experienced for at least 2 
million years. Global mean concentrations of anthropogenic aerosols peaked in the late 20th century and 
have slowly declined since in northern mid-latitudes, although they continue to increase in South Asia and 
East Africa (high confidence). The total anthropogenic effective radiative forcing (ERF) in 2019, relative to 
1750, was 2.72 [1.96 to 3.48] W m−2 (medium confidence) and has likely been growing at an increasing rate 
since the 1970s. {2.2, 6.4, 7.2, 7.3} 
 
Solar activity since 1900 was high but not exceptional compared to the past 9000 years (high confidence). 
The average magnitude and variability of volcanic aerosols since 1900 has not been unusual compared to at 
least the past 2500 years (medium confidence). However, sporadic strong volcanic eruptions can lead to 
temporary drops in global surface temperature lasting 2–5 years. {2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.8, CCB4.1}  
 
Atmospheric CO2 concentrations have changed substantially over millions of years (Figure TS.1). Current 
levels of atmospheric CO2 have not been experienced for at least 2 million years (high confidence, Figure 
TS.9a). Over 1750–2019, CO2 increased by 131.6 ± 2.9 ppm (47.3%). The centennial rate of change of CO2 
since 1850 has no precedent in at least the past 800,000 years (Figure TS.9), and the fastest rates of change 
over the last 56 million years were at least a factor of 4 lower (low confidence) than over 1900–2019. Several 
networks of high-accuracy surface observations show that concentrations of CO2 have exceeded 400 ppm, 
reaching 409.9 (± 0.3) ppm in 2019 (Figure TS.9c). The ERF from CO2 in 2019 (relative to 1750) was 2.16 
Wm-2. {2.2.3, 5.1.2, 5.2.1, 7.3, Box TS.5} 
 
By 2019, concentrations of CH4 reached 1866.3 (± 3.3) ppb (Figure TS.9c). The increase since 1750 of 1137 
± 10 ppb (157.8%) far exceeds the range over multiple glacial-interglacial transitions of the past 800,000 
years (high confidence). In the 1990s, CH4 concentrations plateaued, but started to increase again around 
2007 at an average rate of 7.6 ± 2.7 ppb yr-1 (2010–2019; high confidence). There is high confidence that this 
recent growth is largely driven by emissions from fossil fuel exploitation, livestock, and waste, with ENSO 
driving multi-annual variability of wetland and biomass burning emissions. In 2019, ERF from CH4 was 0.54 
Wm-2. {2.2.3, 5.2.2, 7.3} 
 
Since 1750, N2O increased by 62.0 ± 6.0 ppb, reaching a level of 332.1 (± 0.4) ppb in 2019. The increase 
since 1750 is of comparable magnitude to glacial-interglacial fluctuations of the past 800,000 years (Figure 
TS.9c). N2O concentration trends since 1980 are largely driven by a 30% increase in emissions from the 
expansion and intensification of global agriculture (high confidence). By 2019 its ERF was 0.21 Wm-2. 
{2.2.3, 5.2.3} 
 
<figref>TS.9</figref> 

Halogenated gases consist of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), 
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and other gases, many of which can deplete stratospheric ozone and warm the 
atmosphere. In response to controls on production and consumption mandated by the Montreal Protocol on 
Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and its amendments, the atmospheric abundances of most CFCs 
have continued to decline since AR5. Abundances of of HFCs, which are replacements for CFCs and 
HCFCs, are increasing (high confidence), though increases of the major HCFCs have slowed in recent years. 
The ERF from halogenated components in 2019 was 0.41 Wm-2. {2.2.4, 6.3.4, 7.3.2} 
 
Tropospheric aerosols mainly act to cool the climate system, directly by reflecting solar radiation, and 
indirectly through enhancing cloud reflectance. Ice cores show increases in aerosols across the Northern 
Hemisphere mid-latitudes since 1700, and reductions since the late 20th century (high confidence). Aerosol 
optical depth (AOD), derived from satellite- and ground-based radiometers, has decreased since 2000 over 
the mid-latitude continents of both hemispheres, but increased over South Asia and East Africa (high 
confidence). Trends in AOD are more pronounced from sub-micrometre aerosols for which the 
anthropogenic contribution is particularly large. Global carbonaceous aerosol budgets and trends remain 
poorly characterised due to limited observations, but black carbon (BC), a warming aerosol component, is 
declining in several regions of the Northern Hemisphere (low confidence). Total aerosol ERF in 2019, 
relative to 1750, is −1.1 [−1.7 to −0.4] W m−2 (medium confidence), and more likely than not became less 
negative since the late 20th century, with low confidence in the magnitude of post-2014 changes due to 
conflicting evidence (TS.3.1). {2.2.6, 6.2.1, 6.3.5, 6.4.1, 7.3.3} 
 
There is high confidence that tropospheric ozone has been increasing from 1750 in response to 
anthropogenic changes in ozone precursor emissions (nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, non-methane 
volatile organic compounds, and methane), but with medium confidence in the magnitude of this change, due 
to limited observational evidence and knowledge gaps. Since the mid-20th century, tropospheric ozone 
surface concentrations have increased by 30–70% across the Northern Hemisphere (medium confidence); 
since the mid-1990s free tropospheric ozone has increased by 2–7% per decade in most northern mid-latitude 
regions, and 2–12% per decade in sampled tropical regions. Future changes in surface ozone concentrations 
will be primarily driven by changes in precursor emissions rather than climate change (high confidence). 
Stratospheric ozone has declined between 60˚S–60˚N by 2.2% from 1964–1980 to 2014–2017 (high 
confidence), with the largest declines during 1980–1995. The strongest loss of stratospheric ozone continues 
to occur in austral spring over Antarctica (ozone hole), with emergent signs of recovery after 2000. The 
1750–2019 ERF for total (stratospheric and tropospheric) ozone is 0.47 [0.24 to 0.71] W m−2, which is 
dominated by tropospheric ozone changes. {2.2.5; 6.3.2., 7.3.2, 7.3.5} 
 
The global mean abundance of hydroxyl (OH) radical, or ‘oxidising capacity’, chemically regulates the 
lifetimes of many short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), and therefore the radiative forcing of methane, ozone, 
secondary aerosols and many halogenated species. Model estimates suggest no significant change in 
oxidising capacity from 1850 to 1980 (low confidence). Increases of about 9% over 1980–2014 computed by 
ESMs and carbon cycle models are not confirmed by observationally constrained inverse models, rendering 
an overall medium confidence in stable OH or positive trends since the 1980s, and implying that OH is not 
the primary driver of recent observed growth in CH4. {6.3.6, CCB5.2} 
 
Land use and land-cover change exert biophysical and biogeochemical effects. There is medium confidence 
that the biophysical effects of land-use change since 1750, most notably the increase in global albedo, have 
had an overall cooling on climate, whereas biogeochemical effects (i.e., changes in GHG and volatile 
organic compound emissions or sinks) led to net warming. Overall land use and land cover ERF is estimated 
at -0.2 [-0.3 to -0.1] W m−2. {2.2.7, 7.3.4, SRCCL 2.5} 
 
The total anthropogenic ERF (Figure TS.9) in 2019 relative to 1750 was 2.72 [1.96 to 3.48] W m−2 (Figure 
TS.9), dominated by GHGs (positive ERF) and partially offset by aerosols (negative ERF). The rate of 
change of ERF likely has increased since the 1970s, mainly due to growing CO2 concentrations and less 
negative aerosol ERF. {2.2.8, 7.3} 

## TS.2.3  Upper Air Temperatures and Atmospheric Circulation 
 
The effects of human-induced climate change have been clearly identified in observations of atmospheric 
temperature and some aspects of circulation, and these effects are likely to intensify in the future. 
Tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling are virtually certain to continue with continued net 
emissions of greenhouse gases. Several aspects of the atmospheric circulation have likely changed since the 
mid-20th century, and human influence has likely contributed to the observed poleward expansion of the 
Southern Hemisphere Hadley Cell and very likely contributed to the observed poleward shift of the Southern 
Hemisphere extratropical jet in summer. It is likely that the mid-latitude jet will shift poleward and 
strengthen, accompanied by a strengthening of the storm track in the Southern Hemisphere by 2100 under 
the high CO2 emissions scenarios. It is likely that the proportion of intense tropical cyclones has increased 
over the last four decades and that this cannot be explained entirely by natural variability. There is low 
confidence in observed recent changes in the total number of extratropical cyclones over both hemispheres. 
The proportion of tropical cyclones which are intense is expected to increase (high confidence) but the total 
global number of tropical cyclones is expected to decrease or remain unchanged (medium confidence). {2.3, 
3.3, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 8.3, 8.4, 11.7} 
 
The troposphere has warmed since at least the 1950s, and it is virtually certain that the stratosphere has 
cooled. It is very likely that human-induced increases in GHGs were the main driver of tropospheric warming 
since 1979. It is extremely likely that anthropogenic forcing, both from increases in GHG concentration and 
depletion of stratospheric ozone due to ozone-depleting substances, was the main driver of upper 
stratospheric cooling since 1979. It is very likely that global mean stratospheric cooling will be larger for 
scenarios with higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations. In the tropics, since at least 2001 (when new 
techniques permit more robust quantification), the upper troposphere has warmed faster than the near-surface 
(medium confidence) (Figure TS.10). There is medium confidence that most CMIP5 and CMIP6 models 
overestimate the observed warming in the upper tropical troposphere over the period 1979–2014, in part 
because they overestimate tropical SST warming. It is likely that future tropical upper tropospheric warming 
will be larger than at the tropical surface. {2.3.1, 3.3.1, 4.5.1} 
 
<figref>TS.10</figref>
 
The Hadley Circulation has likely widened since at least the 1980s, predominantly in the Northern 
Hemisphere, although there is only medium confidence in the extent of the changes. This has been 
accompanied by a strengthening of the Hadley Circulation in the Northern Hemisphere (medium confidence). 
It is likely that human influence has contributed to the poleward expansion of the zonal mean Hadley cell in 
the Southern Hemisphere since the 1980s, which is projected to further expand with global warming (high 
confidence). There is medium confidence that the observed poleward expansion in the Northern Hemisphere 
is within the range of internal variability. {2.3.1, 3.3.3, 8.4.3} 
 
Since the 1970s near-surface average winds have likely weakened over land. Over the ocean, near-surface 
average winds likely strengthened over 1980–2000, but divergent estimates lead to low confidence thereafter. 

Extratropical storm tracks have likely shifted poleward since the 1980s. There is low confidence in projected 
poleward shifts of the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude jet and storm tracks due to large internal variability 
and structural uncertainty in model simulations. There is medium confidence in a projected decrease of 
frequency of atmospheric blocking over Greenland and the North Pacific in boreal winter in 2081–2100 
under the SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. There is high confidence that Southern Hemisphere storm tracks 
and associated precipitation have migrated polewards over recent decades, especially in the austral summer 
and autumn, associated with a trend towards more positive phases of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) 
(TS.4.2.2) and the strengthening and southward shift of the Southern Hemisphere extratropical jet in austral 
summer. In the long term (2081–2100), the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude jet is likely to shift poleward 
and strengthen under SSP5-8.5 scenario relative to 1995–2014, accompanied by an increase in the SAM 
(TS.4.2.2). It is likely that wind speeds associated with extratropical cyclones will strengthen in the Southern 
Hemisphere storm track for SSP5-8.5. There is low confidence in the potential role of Arctic warming and 
sea ice loss on historical or projected mid-latitude atmospheric variability. {2.3.1, 3.3.3, 3.7.2, 4.3.3, 4.4.3, 
4.5.1, 4.5.3, 8.2.2, 8.3.2, Cross-Chapter Box 10.1} 
 
It is likely that the proportion of major (Category 3–5) tropical cyclones (TCs) and the frequency of rapid TC 
intensification events have increased over the past four decades. The average location of peak TC wind-
intensity has very likely migrated poleward in the western North Pacific Ocean since the 1940s, and TC 
forward translation speed has likely slowed over the contiguous USA since 1900. It is likely that the 
poleward migration of TCs in the western North Pacific and the global increase in TC intensity rates cannot 
be explained entirely by natural variability. There is high confidence that average peak TC wind speeds and 
the proportion of Category 4–5 TCs will increase with warming and that peak winds of the most intense TCs 
will increase. There is medium confidence that the average location where TCs reach their maximum wind-
intensity will migrate poleward in the western North Pacific Ocean, while the total global frequency of TC 
formation will decrease or remain unchanged with increasing global warming (medium confidence). {11.7} 
 
There is low confidence in observed recent changes in the total number of extratropical cyclones over both 
hemispheres. There is also low confidence in past-century trends in the number and intensity of the strongest 
extratropical cyclones over the Northern Hemisphere due to the large interannual-to-decadal variability and 
temporal and spatial heterogeneities in the volume and type of assimilated data in atmospheric reanalyses, 
particularly before the satellite era. Over the Southern Hemisphere, it is likely that the number of 
extratropical cyclones with low central pressures (<980 hPa) has increased since 1979. The frequency of 
intense extratropical cyclones is projected to decrease (medium confidence). Projected changes in the 
intensity depend on the resolution of climate models (medium confidence). There is medium confidence that 
wind speeds associated with extratropical cyclones will change following changes in the storm tracks. {2.3.1, 
3.3.3, 4.5.1, 4.5.3, 8.3.2, 8.4.2, 11.7.2, 11.7.2} 
 
<boxref>Box TS.3</boxref> 
 
## TS.2.4  The Ocean 
 
Observations, models and paleo-evidence indicate that recently observed changes in the ocean are 
unprecedented for centuries to millennia (high confidence). Over the past four to six decades, it is virtually 
certain that the global ocean has warmed, with human influence extremely likely the main driver since the 
1970s, making climate change irreversible over centuries to millennia (medium confidence). It is virtually 
certain that upper ocean salinity contrasts have increased since the 1950s and extremely likely that human 
influence has contributed. It is virtually certain that upper ocean stratification has increased since 1970 and 
that sea water pH has declined globally over the last 40 years, with human influence the main driver of the 
observed ocean acidification (virtually certain). There is high confidence that marine heatwaves have 
become more frequent in the 20th century, and most of them have been attributed to anthropogenic warming 
since 2006 (very likely). There is high confidence that oxygen levels have dropped in many regions since the 
mid 20th century and that the geographic range of many marine organisms has changed over the last two 
decades. The amount of ocean warming observed since 1971 will likely at least double by 2100 under a low 
warming scenario (SSP1-2.6) and will increase by 4-8 times under a high warming scenario (SSP5-8.5). 
Stratification (virtually certain), acidification (virtually certain), deoxygenation (high confidence) and 
marine heatwave frequency (high confidence) will continue to increase in the 21st century. While there is 
low confidence in 20th century AMOC change, it is very likely that AMOC will decline over the 21st century 
(Figure TS.11). {2.3, 3.5, 3.6, 4.3, 5.3, 7.2, 9.2, 9.4, 9.6, Box 9.2, 12.4} 
 
It is virtually certain that the global ocean has warmed since at least 1971, representing about 90% of the 
increase in the global energy inventory (TS.3.1). The ocean is currently warming faster than at any other 
time since at least the last deglacial transition (medium confidence), with warming extending to depths well 
below 2000 m (very high confidence). It is extremely likely that human influence was the main driver of 
ocean warming. Ocean warming will continue over the 21st century (virtually certain), and will likely 
continue until at least to 2300 even for low CO2 emissions scenarios. Ocean warming is irreversible over 
centuries to millennia (medium confidence), but the magnitude of warming is scenario-dependent from about 
the mid-21st century (medium confidence). The warming will not be globally uniform, with heat primarily 
stored in Southern Ocean water-masses and weaker warming in the subpolar North Atlantic (high 
confidence). Limitations in the understanding of feedback mechanisms limit our confidence in future ocean 
warming close to Antarctica and how this will affect sea ice and ice shelves. {2.3.3, 3.5.1, 4.7.2, 7.2.2, 9.2.2, 
9.2.3, 9.2.4, 9.3.2, 9.6.1; Cross-Chapter Box 9.1} 
  
Global mean SST has increased since the beginning of the 20th century by 0.88 [0.68 to 1.01] °C, and it is 
virtually certain it will continue to increase throughout the 21st century with increasing hazards to marine 
ecosystems (medium confidence). Marine heatwaves have become more frequent over the 20th century (high 
confidence), approximately doubling in frequency (high confidence) and becoming more intense and longer 
since the 1980s (medium confidence). Most of the marine heatwaves over 2006–2015 have been attributed to 
anthropogenic warming (very likely). Marine heatwaves will continue to increase in frequency, with a likely 
global increase of 2–9 times in 2081–2100 compared to 1995–2014 under SSP1-2.6, and 3–15 times under 
SSP5-8.5 (Figure TS.11a), with the largest changes in the tropical and Arctic ocean. {2.3.1, 9.2.1; Box 9.2; 
12.4.8; Cross-Chapter Box 2.3}  
 
Observed upper ocean stratification (0–200 m) has increased globally since at least 1970 (virtually certain). 
Based on recent refined analyses of the available observations, there is high confidence that it increased by 
4.9 ±1.5% from 1970–2018, which is about twice as much as assessed in the SROCC, and will continue to 
increase throughout the 21st century at a rate depending on the emissions scenario (virtually certain). {2.3.3, 
9.2.1} 
 
It is virtually certain that since 1950 near-surface high-salinity regions have become more saline, while low-
salinity regions have become fresher, with medium confidence that this is linked to an intensification of the 
hydrological cycle (Box TS.6). It is extremely likely that human influence has contributed to this salinity 
change and that the large-scale pattern will grow in amplitude over the 21st century (medium confidence). 
{2.3.3, 3.5.2, 9.2.2, 12.4.8} 
 
The AMOC was relatively stable during the past 8,000 years (medium confidence). There is low confidence 
in the quantification of AMOC changes in the 20th century because of low agreement in quantitative 
reconstructed and simulated trends, missing key processes in both models and measurements used for 
formulating proxies, and new model evaluations. Direct observational records since the mid-2000s are too 
short to determine the relative contributions of internal variability, natural forcing and anthropogenic forcing 
to AMOC change (high confidence). An AMOC decline over the 21st century is very likely for all SSP 
scenarios; a possible abrupt decline is assessed further in Box TS.3 (Figure TS.11b). {2.3.3, 3.5.4, 4.3.2, 
8.6.1, 9.2.3, Cross-Chapter Box 12.3} 
 
There is high confidence that many ocean currents will change in the 21st century in response to changes of 
wind stress. There is low confidence in 21st century change of Southern Ocean circulation, despite high 
confidence that it is sensitive to changes in wind patterns and increased ice-shelf melt. Western boundary 
currents and subtropical gyres have shifted poleward since 1993 (medium confidence). Subtropical gyres, the 
East Australian Current Extension, the Agulhas Current, and the Brazil Current are projected to intensify in 
the 21st century in response to changes in wind stress, while the Gulf Stream and the Indonesian 
Throughflow are projected to weaken (medium confidence). All of the four main eastern boundary upwelling 
systems are projected to weaken at low latitudes and intensify at high latitudes in the 21st century (high 
confidence). {2.3.3, 9.2.3} 
 
It is virtually certain that surface pH has declined globally over the last 40 years and that the main driver is 
uptake of anthropogenic CO2. Ocean acidification and associated reductions in the saturation state of calcium 
carbonate – a constituent of skeletons or shells of a variety of marine organisms – is expected to increase in 
the 21st century under all emissions scenarios (high confidence). There is very high confidence that present-
day surface pH values are unprecedented for at least 26,000 years and current rates of pH change are 
unprecedented since at least that time. Over the past 2–3 decades, a pH decline in the ocean interior has been 
observed in all ocean basins (high confidence) (Figure TS.11d). {2.3.3, 2.3.4, 3.6.2, 4.3.2, 5.3.2, 5.3.3, 5.6.3, 
12.4.8} 

 Open-ocean deoxygenation and expansion of oxygen minimum zones has been observed in many areas of 
the global ocean since the mid 20th century (high confidence), in part due to human influence (medium 
confidence). Deoxygenation is projected to continue to increase with ocean warming (high confidence) 
(Figure TS.11c). Higher climate sensitivity and reduced ocean ventilation in CMIP6 compared to CMIP5 
results in substantially greater projections of subsurface (100–600 m) oxygen decline than reported in 
SROCC for the period 2080–2099. {2.3.3, 2.3.4, Cross-Chapter Box 2.4, 3.6.2, 5.3.3, 12.4.8} 
 
Over at least the last two decades, the geographic range of many marine organisms has shifted towards the 
poles and towards greater depths (high confidence), indicative of shifts towards cooler waters. The range of a 
smaller subset of organisms has shifted equatorward and to shallower depths (high confidence). Phenological 
metrics associated with the life cycles of many organisms have also changed over the last two decades or 
longer (high confidence). Since the changes in the geographical range of organisms and their phenological 
metrics have been observed to differ with species and location, there is the possibility of disruption to major 
marine ecosystems. {2.3.4}

## TS.2.5  The Cryosphere 
 
Over recent decades, widespread loss of snow and ice has been observed, and several elements of the 
cryosphere are now in states unseen in centuries (high confidence). Human influence was very likely the 
main driver of observed reductions in Arctic sea ice since the late 1970s (with late-summer sea ice loss likely 
unprecedented for at least 1000 years) and the widespread retreat of glaciers (unprecedented in at least the 
last 2,000 years, medium confidence). Furthermore, human influence very likely contributed to the observed 
Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover decrease since 1950. By contrast, Antarctic sea ice area experienced 
no significant net change since 1979, and there is only low confidence in its projected changes. The Arctic 
Ocean is projected to become practically sea ice-free in late summer under high CO2 emissions scenarios by 
the end of the 21st century (high confidence). It is virtually certain that further warming will lead to further 
reductions of Northern Hemisphere snow cover, and there is high confidence that this is also the case for 
near-surface permafrost volume. Glaciers will continue to lose mass at least for several decades even if 
global temperature is stabilized (very high confidence), and mass loss over the 21st century is virtually 
certain for the Greenland Ice Sheet and likely for the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Deep uncertainty persists with 
respect to the possible evolution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet within the 21st century and beyond, in particular 
due to the potential instability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. {2.3, 3.4, 4.3, 8.3, 9.3-9.6, Box 9.4, 12.4}  
 
Current Arctic sea ice coverage levels (both annual and late summer) are at their lowest since at least 1850 
(high confidence), and for late summer for the past 1,000 years (medium confidence). Since the late 1970s, 
Arctic sea ice area and thickness have decreased in both summer and winter, with sea ice becoming younger, 
thinner and more dynamic (very high confidence). It is very likely that anthropogenic forcing, mainly due to 
greenhouse gas increases, was the main driver of this loss, although new evidence suggests that 
anthropogenic aerosol forcing has offset part of the greenhouse gas–induced losses since the 1950s (medium 
confidence). The annual Arctic sea ice area minimum will likely fall below 1 million km2 at least once before 
2050 under all assessed SSP scenarios. This practically sea ice-free state will become the norm for late 
summer by the end of the 21st century in high CO2 emissions scenarios (high confidence). Arctic summer 
sea ice varies approximately linearly with global surface temperature, implying that there is no tipping point 
and observed/projected losses are potentially reversible (high confidence). {2.3.2, 3.4.1, 4.3.2, 9.3.1, 12.4.9} 
 
For Antarctic sea ice, there is no significant trend in satellite-observed sea ice area from 1979 to 2020 in both 
winter and summer, due to regionally opposing trends and large internal variability. Due to mismatches 
between model simulations and observations, combined with a lack of understanding of reasons for 
substantial inter-model spread, there is low confidence in model projections of future Antarctic sea ice 
changes, particularly at the regional level. {2.3.2, 3.4.1, 9.3.2}   
 
In permafrost regions, increases in ground temperatures in the upper 30 m over the past three to four decades 
have been widespread (high confidence). For each additional 1°C of warming (up to 4°C above the 1850–
1900 level), the global volume of perennially frozen ground to 3 m below the surface is projected to decrease 
by about 25% relative to the present volume (medium confidence). However, these decreases may be 
underestimated due to an incomplete representation of relevant physical processes in ESMs (low confidence). 
Seasonal snow cover is treated in TS.2.6. {2.3.2, 9.5.2, 12.4.9} 
 
There is very high confidence that, with few exceptions, glaciers have retreated since the second half of the 
19th century; this behaviour is unprecedented in at least the last 2,000 years (medium confidence). Mountain 
glaciers very likely contributed 67.2 [41.8 to 92.6] mm to the observed GMSL change between 1901 and 
2018. This retreat has occurred at increased rates since the 1990s, with human influences very likely being 
the main driver. Under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively, glaciers are projected to lose 18% ± 13% and 36% 
± 20% of their current mass over the 21st century (medium confidence). {2.3.2, 3.4.3, 9.5.1, 9.6.1} 
 
The Greenland Ice Sheet was smaller than at present during the Last Interglacial period (roughly 125,000 
years ago) and the mid-Holocene (roughly 6,000 years ago) (high confidence). After reaching a recent 
maximum ice mass at some point between 1450 and 1850, the ice sheet retreated overall, with some decades 
likely close to equilibrium (i.e., mass loss approximately equalling mass gained). It is virtually certain that 
the Greenland Ice Sheet has lost mass since the 1990s, with human influence a contributing factor (medium 
confidence). There is high confidence that annual mass changes have been consistently negative since the 
early 2000s. Over the period 1992–2020, Greenland likely lost 4890 ± 460 Gt of ice, contributing 13.5 ± 1.3 
mm to global mean sea level rise. There is high confidence that Greenland ice mass losses are increasingly 
dominated by surface melting and runoff, with large interannual variability arising from changes in surface 
mass balance. Projections of future Greenland ice-mass loss (Box TS.4, Table 1; Figure TS.11e) are 
dominated by increased surface melt under all emissions scenarios (high confidence). Potential irreversible 
long-term loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet, and of parts of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, is assessed in Box TS.9. 
{2.3.2, 3.4.3, 9.4.1, 9.4.2, 9.6.3, Atlas.11.2} 
  
It is likely that the Antarctic Ice Sheet has lost 2670 ± 530 Gt, contributing 7.4 ± 1.5 mm to global mean sea 
level rise over 1992–2020. The total Antarctic ice mass losses were dominated by the West Antarctic Ice 
Sheet, with combined West Antarctic and Peninsula annual loss rates increasing since about 2000 (very high 
confidence). Furthermore, it is very likely that parts of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet have lost mass since 
1979. Since the 1970s, snowfall has likely increased over the western Antarctic Peninsula and eastern West 
Antarctica, with large spatial and interannual variability over the rest of Antarctica. Mass losses from West 
Antarctic outlet glaciers, mainly induced by ice shelf basal melt (high confidence), outpace mass gain from 
increased snow accumulation on the continent (very high confidence). However, there is only limited 
evidence, with medium agreement, of anthropogenic forcing of the observed Antarctic mass loss since 1992 
(with low confidence in process attribution). Increasing mass loss from ice shelves and inland discharge will 
likely continue to outpace increasing snowfall over the 21st century (Figure TS.11f). Deep uncertainty 
persists with respect to the possible evolution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet along high-end mass-loss storylines 
within the 21st century and beyond, primarily related to the abrupt and widespread onset of Marine Ice Sheet 
Instability and Marine Ice Cliff Instability. {2.3.2, 3.4.3, 9.4.2, 9.6.3, Box 9.4, Atlas.11.1, Box TS.3, Box 
TS.4}

## TS.2.6  Land Climate, Including Biosphere and Extremes 
 
Land surface air temperatures have risen faster than the global surface temperature since the 1850s, and it is 
virtually certain that this differential warming will persist into the future. It is virtually certain that the 
frequency and intensity of hot extremes and the intensity and duration of heat waves have increased since 
1950 and will further increase in the future even if global warming is stabilized at 1.5°C. The frequency and 
intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased over a majority of those land regions with good 
observational coverage (high confidence) and will extremely likely increase over most continents with 
additional global warming. Over the past half century, key aspects of the biosphere have changed in ways 
that are consistent with large-scale warming: climate zones have shifted poleward, and the growing season 
length in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics has increased (high confidence). The amplitude of the 
seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 poleward of 45°N has increased since the 1960s (very high confidence), 
with increasing productivity of the land biosphere due to the increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration as 
the main driver (medium confidence). Global-scale vegetation greenness has increased since the 1980s (high 
confidence). {2.3, 3.6, 4.3, 4.5, 5.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.9, 12.4} 
 
Observed temperatures over land have increased by 1.61 [1.34–1.83] °C between the period 1850–1900 and 
2011–2020. Warming of the land is about 45% larger than for global surface temperature, and about 80% 
larger than warming of the ocean surface. Warming of the land surface during the period 1971–2018 
contributed about 5% of the increase in the global energy inventory (TS.3.1), nearly twice the estimate in 
AR5 (high confidence). It is virtually certain that the average surface warming over land will continue to be 
higher than over the ocean throughout the 21st century. The warming pattern will likely vary seasonally, with 
northern high latitudes warming more during winter than summer (medium confidence). {2.3.1, 4.3.1, 4.5.1, 
Box 7.2, 7.2.2, Cross-Chapter Box 9.1, 11.3, Atlas 11.2} 
 
The frequency and intensity of hot extremes (warm days and nights) and the intensity and duration of 
heatwaves have increased globally and in most regions since 1950, while the frequency and intensity of cold 
extremes have decreased (virtually certain). There is high confidence that the increases in frequency and 
severity of hot extremes are due to human-induced climate change. Some recent extreme events would have 
been extremely unlikely to occur without human influence on the climate system. It is virtually certain that 
the further changes in hot and cold extremes will occur throughout the 21st century in nearly all inhabited 
regions, even if global warming is stabilized at 1.5°C (Table TS.2, Figure TS.12a). {1.3, Cross-Chapter Box 
3.2, 11.1.4, 11.3.2, 11.3.4, 11.3.5, 11.9, 12.4} 
 
Greater warming over land alters key water cycle characteristics (Box TS.6). The rate of change in mean 
precipitation and runoff, and their variability, increases with global warming (Figure TS.12e,f). The majority 
of the land area has experienced decreases in available water during dry seasons due to the overall increase 
in evapotranspiration (medium confidence). The land area affected by increasing drought frequency and 
severity will expand with increasing global warming (high confidence; Figure TS.12c). There is low 
confidence that the increase of plant water-use efficiency due to higher atmospheric CO2 concentration 
alleviates extreme agricultural and ecological droughts in conditions characterized by limited soil moisture 
and increased atmospheric evaporative demand. {2.3.1, CCB 5.1, 8.2.3, 8.4.1, Box 11.1, 11.2.4, 11.4, 11.6} 
 
Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover has decreased since at least 1978 (very high confidence), and there 
is high confidence that trends in snow cover loss extend back to 1950. It is very likely that human influence 
contributed to these reductions. Earlier onset of snowmelt has contributed to seasonally dependent changes 
in streamflow (high confidence). A further decrease of Northern Hemisphere seasonal snow cover extent is 
virtually certain under further global warming (Figure TS.12d). {2.3.2, 3.4.2, 8.3.2. 9.5.3, 12.4, Atlas 8.2, 
9.2, 11.2}  
 
The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased over a majority of land regions 
with good observational coverage since 1950 (high confidence, Box TS.6, Table TS.2). Human influence is 
likely the main driver of this change (Table TS.2). It is extremely likely that on most continents heavy 
precipitation will become more frequent and more intense with additional global warming (Table TS.2, 
Figure TS.12 b). The projected increase in heavy precipitation extremes translates to an increase in the 
frequency and magnitude of pluvial floods (high confidence) (Table TS.2). {Cross-Chapter Box 3.2, 8.4.1, 
11.4.2, 11.4.4, 11.5.5, 12.4} 
 
The probability of compound extreme events has likely increased due to human-induced climate change. 
Concurrent heat waves and droughts have become more frequent over the last century, and this trend will 
continue with higher global warming (high confidence). The probability of compound flooding (storm surge, 
extreme rainfall and/or river flow) has increased in some locations, and will continue to increase due to both 
sea level rise and increases in heavy precipitation, including changes in precipitation intensity associated 
with tropical cyclones (high confidence). {11.8.1, 11.8.2, 11.8.3} 
 
Changes in key aspects of the terrestrial biosphere, such as an increase of the growing season length in much 
of the Northern Hemisphere extratropics since the mid-20th century (high confidence), are consistent with 
large-scale warming. At the same time an increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 
beyond 45°N since the early 1960s (high confidence) and a global-scale increase in vegetation greenness of 
the terrestrial surface since the early 1980s (high confidence) have been observed. Increasing atmospheric 
CO2, warming at high latitudes and land management interventions have contributed to the observed 
greening trend, but there is low confidence in their relative roles. There is medium confidence that increased 
plant growth associated with CO2 fertilization is the main driver of the observed increase in amplitude of the 
seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 in the Northern hemisphere. Reactive nitrogen, ozone and aerosols affect 
terrestrial vegetation and carbon cycle through deposition and effects on large-scale radiation (high 
confidence), but the magnitude of these effects on the land carbon sink, ecosystem productivity and indirect 
CO2 forcing remains uncertain. {2.3.4, 3.6.1, 5.2.1, 6.4.5, 12.3.7, 12.4}  
 
Over the last century, there has been a poleward and upslope shift in the distribution of many land species 
(very high confidence) as well as increases in species turnover within many ecosystems (high confidence). 
There is high confidence that the geographical distribution of climate zones has shifted in many parts of the 
world in the last half century. SRCCL concluded that continued warming will exacerbate desertification 
processes (medium confidence) and ecosystems will become increasingly exposed to climates beyond those 
that they are currently adapted to (high confidence). There is medium confidence that climate change will 
increase disturbance by, for example, fire and tree mortality across several ecosystems. Increases are 
projected in drought, aridity, and fire weather in some regions (TS.4.3; high confidence). There is low 
confidence in the magnitude of these changes, but the probability of crossing uncertain regional thresholds 
(e.g., fires, forest dieback) increases with further warming (high confidence). The response of 
biogeochemical cycles to the anthropogenic perturbation can be abrupt at regional scales, and irreversible on 
decadal to century time scales (high confidence). {2.3.4, 5.4.3, 5.4.9, 11.6, 11.8, 12.5, SRCCL 2.2, SRCCL

# TS.3  Understanding the Climate System Response and Implications for Limiting Global Warming 
 
This section summarizes advances in our knowledge of the Earth’s energy budget, including the time 
evolution of forcings and climate feedbacks that lead to the climate system responses summarized in TS.2. It 
assesses advances since AR5 and SR1.5 in the estimation of remaining carbon budgets, the Earth system 
response to carbon dioxide removal and quantification of metrics that allow comparison of the relative 
effects of different forcing agents. The section also highlights future climate and air pollution responses due 
to projected changes in short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), the state of understanding of the climate 
response to potential interventions related to solar radiation modification (SRM), and irreversibility, tipping 
points and abrupt changes in the climate system.   
 
 
## TS.3.1  Radiative Forcing and Energy Budget 
 

Since AR5, the accumulation of energy in the Earth system, quantified by observations of warming of the 
ocean, atmosphere, land and melting of ice, has become established as a robust measure of the rate of global 
climate change on interannual-to-decadal time scales. Compared to changes in global surface temperature, 
the increase in the global energy inventory exhibits less variability, and thus better indicates underlying 
climate trends. The global energy inventory increased by 435 [325 to 545] Zettajoules (ZJ, equal to 1021 
Joules) for the period 1971–2018 and 153 [100 to 206] ZJ for the period 2006–2018 (Figure TS.13), with 
more than 90% accounted for by ocean warming. To put these numbers in context, the 2006–2018 average 
Earth system heating is equivalent to approximately 20 times the rate of global energy consumption in 2018.  
The accumulation of energy is driven by a positive total anthropogenic effective radiative forcing (ERF) 
relative to 1750. The best estimate ERF of 2.72 W m−2 has increased by 0.43 Wm-2 relative to that given in 
AR5 (for 1750–2014) due to an increase in the greenhouse gas ERF that is partly compensated by a more 
negative aerosol ERF compared to AR5. The greenhouse gas ERF has been revised due to changes in 
atmospheric concentrations and updates to forcing efficiencies, while the revision to aerosol ERF is due to 
increased understanding of aerosol–cloud interactions and is supported by improved agreement between 
different lines of evidence. Improved quantification of ERF, the climate system radiative response and the 
observed energy increase in the Earth system for the period 1971–2018 demonstrate improved closure of the 
global energy budget (i.e., the extent to which the sum of the integrated forcing and the integrated radiative 
response equals the energy gain of the Earth system) compared to AR5. (high confidence) {7.2.2, Box 7.2, 
Table 7.1, 7.3.5, 7.5.2, FAQ7.1} 

<figref>TS.13</figref>

The global energy inventory change for the period 1971–2018 corresponds to an Earth energy imbalance 
(Box TS.1) of 0.57 [0.43 to 0.72] W m-2, increasing to 0.79 [0.52 to 1.06] W m-2 for the period 2006–2018. 
Ocean heat uptake is by far the largest contribution and accounts for 91% of the total energy change. Land 
warming, melting of ice and warming of the atmosphere account for about 5%, 3% and 1% of the total 
change, respectively. More comprehensive analysis of inventory components, cross-validation of satellite 
and in situ-based estimates of the global energy imbalance and closure of the global sea level budget have 
led to a strengthened assessment relative to AR5. (high confidence) {Box 7.2, 7.2.2, Table 7.1, 7.5.2.3, 
Cross-Chapter Box 9.1, 9.6.1, Table 9.5} 
 
As in AR5, the perturbations to the Earth’s top-of-atmosphere energy budget are quantified using ERFs (also 
see TS.2.2). These include any consequent adjustments to the climate system (e.g., from changes in 
atmospheric temperatures, clouds, and water vapour as shown in Figure TS.14), but exclude any surface 
temperature response. Since the AR5, ERFs have been estimated for a larger number of forcing agents and 
shown to be more closely related to the temperature response than the stratospheric-temperature adjusted 
radiative forcing. (high confidence) {7.3.1} 
 
<figref>TS.14</figref> 
 
Improved quantification of ERF, the climate system radiative response, and the observed energy increase in 
the Earth system for the period 1971–2018, demonstrate improved closure of the global energy budget 
relative to AR5 (Figure TS.13). Combining the likely range of ERF over this period with the central estimate 
of radiative response gives an expected energy gain of 340 [47 to 662] ZJ. Both estimates are consistent with 
an independent observation-based assessment of the global energy increase of 284 [96 to 471] ZJ, (very 
likely range) expressed relative to the estimated 1850–1900 Earth energy imbalance. (high confidence) 
{7.2.2, Box 7.2, 7.3.5} 
 
The assessed greenhouse gas ERF over the 1750–2019 period (TS.2.2) has increased by 0.59 W m−2 over 
AR5 estimates for 1750–2011. This increase includes +0.34 W m-2 from increases in atmospheric 
concentrations of well-mixed greenhouse gases (including halogenated species) since 2011, +0.15 W m-2 
from upwards revisions of their radiative efficiencies and +0.10 W m-2 from re-evaluation of the ozone and 
stratospheric water vapour ERF. {7.3.2, 7.3.4, 7.3.5}  
 
For CO2, CH4, N2O, and chlorofluorocarbons, there is now evidence to quantify the effect on ERF of 
tropospheric adjustments. The assessed ERF for a doubling of CO2 compared to 1750 levels (3.9 ± 0.5 
Wm‑2) is larger than in AR5. For CO2, the adjustments include the physiological effects on vegetation. The 
reactive well-mixed greenhouse gases (methane, nitrous oxide, and halocarbons) cause additional chemical 
adjustments to the atmosphere through changes in ozone and aerosols (Figure TS.15a). The ERF due to 
methane emissions is 1.21 [0.90 to 1.51] W m–2, of which 0.33 [0.25 to 0.41] W m–2 is attributed to chemical 
adjustments mainly via ozone. These chemical adjustments also affect the emission metrics (Section 
TS.3.3.3). SO2 emission changes make the dominant contribution to the ERF from aerosol–cloud interactions 
(high confidence). Over the 1750–2019 period, the contributions from the emitted compounds to global 
surface temperature changes broadly match their contributions to the ERF (high confidence) (Figure 
TS.15b). Since a peak in emissions-induced SO2 ERF has already occurred recently (TS.2.2) and since there 
is a delay in the full global surface temperature response owing to the thermal inertia in the climate system, 
changes in SO2 emissions have a slightly larger contribution to global surface temperature change compared 
with changes in CO2 emissions, relative to their respective contributions to ERF. {6.4.2, 7.3.2} 
 
Aerosols contributed an ERF of –1.3 [–2.0 to –0.6] W m–2 over the period 1750 to 2014 (medium 
confidence). The ERF due to aerosol–cloud interactions (ERFaci) contributes most to the magnitude of the 
total aerosol ERF (high confidence), and is assessed to be –1.0 [–1.7 to –0.3] W m–2 (medium confidence), 
with the remainder due to aerosol–radiation interactions (ERFari), assessed to be –0.3 [–0.6 to 0.0] W m–2 
(medium confidence). There has been an increase in the estimated magnitude – but a reduction in the 
uncertainty – of the total aerosol ERF relative to AR5, supported by a combination of increased process-
understanding and progress in modelling and observational analyses (Figure TS.15c). Effective radiative 
forcing estimates from these separate lines of evidence are now consistent with each other, in contrast to 
AR5, and support the assessment that it is virtually certain that the total aerosol ERF is negative. Compared 
to AR5, the assessed magnitude of ERFaci has increased, while that of ERFari has decreased. {7.3.3, 7.3.5}

## TS.3.2   Climate Sensitivity and Earth-System Feedbacks 
 
### TS.3.2.1  Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity, Transient Climate Response, and Transient Climate Response to Cumulative Carbon-dioxide Emissions 

Since AR5, substantial quantitative progress has been made in combining new evidence of Earth’s climate 
sensitivity, with improvements in the understanding and quantification of Earth’s energy imbalance, the 
instrumental record of global surface temperature change, paleoclimate change from proxy records, climate 
feedbacks and their dependence on time scale and climate state. A key advance is the broad agreement across 
these multiple lines of evidence, supporting a best estimate of equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) of 3°C, 
with a very likely range of 2°C to 5°C. The likely range of 2.5°C to 4°C is narrower than the AR5 likely range 
of 1.5°C to 4.5°C. {7.4, 7.5} 

 Constraints on ECS and TCR (see Glossary) are based on four main lines of evidence: feedback process 
understanding, climate change and variability seen within the instrumental record, paleoclimate evidence, 
and so-called ‘emergent constraints’, whereby a relationship between an observable quantity and either ECS 
or TCR established within an ensemble of models is combined with observations to derive a constraint on 
ECS or TCR. In reports up to and including the IPCC third assessment report, ECS and TCR derived directly 
from ESMs were the primary line of evidence. However, since AR4, historical warming and paleoclimates 
provided useful additional evidence (Figure TS.16a). AR6 differs from previous reports in not directly using 
climate model estimates of ECS and TCR in the assessed ranges of climate sensitivity. {1.5, 7.5} 
  
It is now clear that when estimating ECS and TCR, the dependence of feedbacks on time scales and the 
climate state must be accounted for. Feedback processes are expected to become more positive overall (more 
amplifying of global surface temperature changes) on multi-decadal time scales as the spatial pattern of 
surface warming evolves and global surface temperature increases, leading to an ECS that is higher than was 
inferred in AR5 based on warming over the instrumental record (high confidence). Historical surface 
temperature change since 1870 has shown relatively little warming in several key regions of positive 
feedbacks, including the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean and the Southern Ocean, while showing greater 
warming in key regions of negative feedbacks, including the western Pacific warm pool. Based on process 
understanding, climate modelling, and paleoclimate reconstructions of past warm periods, it is expected that 
future warming will become enhanced over the eastern Pacific Ocean (medium confidence) and Southern 
Ocean (high confidence) on centennial time scales. This new understanding, along with updated estimates of 
historical temperature change, ERF, and energy imbalance, reconciles previously disparate ECS estimates. 
{7.4.4, 7.5.2, 7.5.3,} 
 
The AR6 best estimate of ECS is 3°C, the likely range is 2.5 to 4°C and the very likely range is 2 to 5°C. 
There is a high level of agreement among the four main lines of evidence listed above (Figure TS.16b), and 
altogether it is virtually certain that ECS is larger than 1.5°C, but currently it is not possible to rule out ECS 
values above 5°C. Therefore, the 5°C upper end of the very likely range is assessed with medium confidence 
and the other bounds with high confidence. {7.5.5} 
 
Based on process understanding, warming over the instrumental record, and emergent constraints, the best 
estimate of TCR is 1.8°C, the likely range is 1.4° to 2.2°C and the very likely range is 1.2° to 2.4°C. There is 
a high level of agreement among the different lines of evidence (Figure TS.16c) (high confidence). {7.5.5} 
 
On average, CMIP6 models have higher mean ECS and TCR values than the CMIP5 generation of models 
and also have higher mean values and wider spreads than the assessed best estimates and very likely ranges 
within this Report. These higher mean ECS and TCR values can, in some models, be traced to changes in 
extratropical cloud feedbacks (medium confidence). The broader ECS and TCR ranges from CMIP6 also 
lead the models to project a range of future warming that is wider than the assessed future warming range, 
which is based on multiple lines of evidence (Cross-Section Box TS.1). However, some of the high-
sensitivity CMIP6 models (TS.1.2.2) are less consistent with observed recent changes in global warming and 
with paleoclimate proxy records than models with ECS within the very likely range. Similarly, some of the 
low-sensitivity models are less consistent with the paleoclimate data. The CMIP6 models with the highest 
ECS and TCRs values provide insights into low-likelihood, high-impact futures, which cannot be excluded 
based on currently available evidence (Cross-Section Box TS.1). {4.3.1, 4.3.4, 7.4.2, 7.5.6} 
 
Uncertainties regarding the true value of ECS and TCR are the dominant source of uncertainty in global 
temperature projections over the 21st century under moderate to high GHG concentrations scenarios. For 
scenarios that reach net zero CO2 emissions (TS.3.3), the uncertainty in the ERF values of aerosol and other 
SLCFs contribute substantial uncertainty in projected temperature. Global ocean heat uptake is a smaller 
source of uncertainty in centennial warming. {7.5.7} 
 
<figref>TS.16</figref>
 
The transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions (TCRE) is the ratio between globally averaged 
surface temperature increase and cumulative CO2 emissions (see Glossary). This report reaffirms with high 
confidence the finding of AR5 that there is a near-linear relationship between cumulative CO2 emissions and 
the increase in global average temperature caused by CO2 over the course of this century for global warming 
levels up to at least 2°C relative to 1850–1900. The TCRE falls likely in the 1.0°C–2.3°C per 1000 PgC 
range, with a best estimate of 1.65°C per 1000 PgC. This range is about 15% narrower than the 0.8°–2.5°C 
per 1000 PgC assessment of the AR5 because of a better integration of evidence across chapters, in particular 
the assessment of TCR. Beyond this century, there is low confidence that the TCRE alone remains an 
accurate predictor of temperature changes in scenarios of very low or net negative CO2 emissions because of 
uncertain Earth system feedbacks that can result in further changes in temperature or a path dependency of 
warming as a function of cumulative CO2 emissions. {5.4, 5.5.1, 4.6.2} 
 
 
### TS.3.2.2  Earth System Feedbacks 
 
The combined effect of all climate feedback processes is to amplify the climate response to forcing (virtually 
certain). While major advances in the understanding of cloud processes have increased the level of 
confidence and decreased the uncertainty range for the cloud feedback by about 50% compared to AR5, 
clouds remain the largest contribution to overall uncertainty in climate feedbacks (high confidence). 
Uncertainties in the ECS and other climate sensitivity metrics, such as the transient climate response (TCR) 
and the transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions (TCRE), are the dominant source of 
uncertainty in global temperature projections over the 21st century under moderate to high GHG emissions 
scenarios. CMIP6 models have higher mean values and wider spreads in ECS and TCR than the assessed 
best estimates and very likely ranges within this Report, leading the models to project a range of future 
warming that is wider than the assessed future warming range (TS.2.2). {7.1, 7.4.2, 7.5} 

 
Earth system feedbacks can be categorised into three broad groups: physical feedbacks, biogeophysical and 
biogeochemical feedbacks, and feedbacks associated with ice sheets. In previous assessments, the ECS has 
been associated with a distinct set of physical feedbacks (Planck response, water vapour, lapse rate, surface 
albedo, and cloud feedbacks). In this assessment, a more general definition of ECS is adopted whereby all 
biogeophysical and biogeochemical feedbacks that do not affect the atmospheric concentration of CO2 are 
included. These include changes in natural methane emissions, natural aerosol emissions, nitrous oxide, 
ozone, and vegetation, which all act on time scales of years to decades and are therefore relevant for 
temperature change over the 21st century. Because the total biogeophysical and non-CO2 biogeochemical 
feedback is assessed to have a central value that is near zero (low confidence), including it does not affect 
the assessed ECS but does contribute to the net feedback uncertainty. The biogeochemical feedbacks that 
affect the atmospheric concentration of CO2 are not included because ECS is defined as the response to a 
sustained doubling of CO2. Moreover, the long-term feedbacks associated with ice sheets are not included in 
the ECS owing to their long time scales of adjustment. {5.4, 6.4, 7.4, 7.5, Box 7.1} 
 
The net effect of changes in clouds in response to global warming is to amplify human-induced warming, 
that is, the net cloud feedback is positive (high confidence). Compared to AR5, major advances in the 
understanding of cloud processes have increased the level of confidence and decreased the uncertainty range 
in the cloud feedback by about 50% (Figure TS.17a). An assessment of the low-altitude cloud feedback over 
the subtropical ocean, which was previously the major source of uncertainty in the net cloud feedback, is 
improved owing to a combined use of climate model simulations, satellite observations, and explicit 
simulations of clouds, altogether leading to strong evidence that this type of cloud amplifies global warming. 
The net cloud feedback is assessed to be +0.42 [–0.10 to 0.94] W m–2 °C–1. A net negative cloud feedback is 
very unlikely. The CMIP5 and CMIP6 ranges of cloud feedback are similar to this assessed range, with 
CMIP6 having a slightly more positive median cloud feedback (high confidence). The surface albedo 
feedback and combined water vapour-lapse rate feedback are positive (Figure TS.17a), with high confidence 
in the estimated value of each based on multiple lines of evidence, including observations, models, and 
theory. {7.4.2, Figure 7.14, Table 7.10, Box TS.6} 
 
Natural sources and sinks of non-CO2 greenhouse gases such as methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) 
respond both directly and indirectly to atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate change, and thereby give 
rise to additional biogeochemical feedbacks in the climate system. Many of these feedbacks are only 
partially understood and are not yet fully included in ESMs. There is medium confidence that the net 
response of natural ocean and land CH4 and N2O sources to future warming will be increased emissions, but 
the magnitude and timing of the responses of each individual process is known with low confidence. {5.4.7} 
 
Non-CO2 biogeochemical feedbacks induced from changes in emissions, abundances or lifetimes of SLCFs 
mediated by natural processes or atmospheric chemistry are assessed to decrease ECS (Figure TS.17b). 
These non-CO2 biogeochemical feedbacks are estimated from ESMs, which since AR5 have advanced to 
include a consistent representation of biogeochemical cycles and atmospheric chemistry. However, process-
level understanding of many biogeochemical feedbacks involving SLCFs, particularly natural emissions, is 
still emerging, resulting in low confidence in the magnitude and sign of the feedbacks. The central estimate 
of the total biogeophysical and non-CO2 biogeochemical feedback is assessed to be −0.01 [–0.27 to +0.25] 
W m–2 °C–1 (Figure TS.17a). {5.4.7, 5.4.8, 6.2.2, 6.4.5, 7.4, Table 7.10} 
 
The combined effect of all known radiative feedbacks (physical, biogeophysical, and non-CO2 
biogeochemical) is to amplify the base climate response (in the absence of feedbacks), also known as the 
Planck temperature response<ref>17</ref> (virtually certain). Combining these feedbacks with the Planck response, the 
net climate feedback parameter is assessed to be –1.16 [–1.81 to –0.51] W m–2 °C–1, which is slightly less 
negative than that inferred from the overall ECS assessment. The combined water vapour and lapse rate 
feedback makes the largest single contribution to global warming, whereas the cloud feedback remains the 
largest contribution to overall uncertainty. Due to the state-dependence of feedbacks, as evidenced from 
paleoclimate observations and from models, the net feedback parameter will increase (become less negative) 
as global temperature increases. Furthermore, on long time scales the ice sheet feedback parameter is very 
likely positive, promoting additional warming on millennial timescales as ice sheets come into equilibrium 
with the forcing. (high confidence) {7.4.2, 7.4.3, Figure 7.14, Table 7.10} 
 
The carbon cycle provides for additional feedbacks on climate owing to the sensitivity of land–atmosphere 
and ocean–atmosphere carbon fluxes and storage to changes in climate and in atmospheric CO2 (Figure 
TS.17c). Because of the time scales associated with land and ocean carbon uptake, these feedbacks are 
known to be scenario dependent. Feedback estimates deviate from linearity in scenarios of stabilizing or 
reducing concentrations. With high confidence, increased atmospheric CO2 will lead to increased land and 
ocean carbon uptake, acting as a negative feedback on climate change. It is likely that a warmer climate will 
lead to reduced land and ocean carbon uptake, acting as a positive feedback. {4.3.2, 5.4.1-5, Box TS.4} 
 
Thawing terrestrial permafrost will lead to carbon release (high confidence), but there is low confidence in 
the timing, magnitude and the relative roles of CO2 versus CH4 as feedback processes. An ensemble of 
models projects CO2 release from permafrost to be 3–41 PgC per 1ºC of global warming by 2100, leading to 
warming strong enough that it must be included in estimates of the remaining carbon budget but weaker than 
the warming from fossil fuel burning. However, the incomplete representation of important processes, such 
as abrupt thaw, combined with weak observational constraints, only allow low confidence in both the 
magnitude of these estimates and in how linearly proportional this feedback is to the amount of global 
warming. There is emerging evidence that permafrost thaw and thermokarst give rise to increased CH4 and 
N2O emissions, which leads to the combined radiative forcing from permafrost thaw being larger than from 
CO2 emissions only. However, the quantitative understanding of these additional feedbacks is low, 
particularly for N2O. These feedbacks, as well as potential additional carbon losses due to climate-induced 
fire feedback are not routinely included in Earth System models. {Box 5.1, 5.4.3, 5.4.7, 5.4.8, Box TS.9} 
 
<figref>TS.17</figref> 
 
## TS.3.3   Temperature Stabilization, Net Zero Emissions and Mitigation 
 
### TS.3.3.1   Remaining Carbon Budgets and Temperature Stabilization 
 
The near-linear relationship between cumulative CO2 emissions and maximum global surface temperature 
increase caused by CO2 implies that stabilizing human-induced global temperature increase at any level 
requires net anthropogenic CO2 emissions to become zero. This near-linear relationship further implies that 
mitigation requirements for limiting warming to specific levels can be quantified in terms of a carbon budget 
(high confidence). Remaining carbon budget estimates have been updated since the AR5 with 
methodological improvements, resulting in larger estimates that are consistent with SR1.5. Several factors, 
including estimates of historical warming, future emissions from thawing permafrost, variations in projected 
non-CO2 warming, and the global surface temperature change after cessation of CO2 emissions, affect the 
exact value of carbon budgets (high confidence). {1.3.5, Box 1.2, 4.7.1, 5.5} 

 
Limiting further climate change would require substantial and sustained reductions of GHG emissions. 
Without net zero CO2 emissions, and a decrease in the net non-CO2 forcing (or sufficient net negative CO2 
emissions to offset any further warming from net non-CO2 forcing), the climate system will continue to 
warm. There is high confidence that mitigation requirements for limiting warming to specific levels over this 
century can be estimated using a carbon budget that relates cumulative CO2 emissions to global mean 
temperature increase (Figure TS.18, Table TS.3). For the period 1850–2019, a total of 2390 ± 240 GtCO2 of 
anthropogenic CO2 has been emitted. Remaining carbon budgets (starting from 1 January 2020) for limiting 
warming to 1.5°C, 1.7°C, and 2.0°C are estimated at 500 GtCO2, 850 GtCO2 and 1350 GtCO2, respectively, 
based on the 50th percentile of TCRE. For the 67th percentile, the respective values are 400 GtCO2, 700 
GtCO2 and 1150 GtCO2. The remaining carbon budget estimates for different temperature limits assume that 
non-CO2 emissions are mitigated consistent with the median reductions found in scenarios in the literature as 
assessed in SR1.5, but they may vary by an estimated ±220 GtCO2 depending on how deeply future non-CO2 
emissions are assumed to be reduced (Table TS.3). {5.5.2, 5.6, Box 5.2, 7.6} 
 
<figref>TS.18</figref>
<tableref>TS.3</tableref>

There is high confidence that several factors, including estimates of historical warming, future emissions 
from thawing permafrost, and variations in projected non-CO2 warming, affect the value of carbon budgets 
but do not change the conclusion that global CO2 emissions would need to decline to net zero to halt global 
warming. Estimates may vary by ±220 GtCO2 depending on the level of non-CO2 emissions at the time 
global anthropogenic CO2 emissions reach net zero levels. This variation is referred to as non-CO2 scenario 
uncertainty and will be further assessed in the AR6 Working Group III Contribution. Geophysical 
uncertainties surrounding the climate response to these non-CO2 emissions result in an additional uncertainty 
of at least ±220 GtCO2, and uncertainties in the level of historical warming result in a ±550 GtCO2 
uncertainty. {5.4, 5.5.2}  
 
Methodological improvements and new evidence result in updated remaining carbon budget estimates. The 
assessment in AR6 applies the same methodological improvements as in SR1.5, which uses a recent 
observed baseline for historic temperature change and cumulative emissions. Changes compared to SR1.5 
are therefore small: the assessment of new evidence results in updated median remaining carbon budget 
estimates for limiting warming to 1.5°C and 2°C being the same and about 60 GtCO2 smaller, respectively, 
after accounting for emissions since SR1.5. Meanwhile, remaining carbon budgets for limiting warming to 
1.5°C would be about 300–350 GtCO2 larger if evidence and methods available at the time of the AR5 
would be used. If a specific remaining carbon budget is exceeded, this results in a lower probability of 
keeping warming below a specified temperature level and higher irreversible global warming over decades to 
centuries, or alternatively a need for net negative CO2 emissions or further reductions in non-CO2 
greenhouse gases after net zero CO2 is achieved to return warming to lower levels in the long term. {5.5.2, 
5.6, Box 5.2} 
 
Based on idealized model simulations that explore the climate response once CO2 emissions have been 
brought to zero, the magnitude of the zero CO2 emissions commitment (ZEC, see Glossary) is assessed to be 
likely smaller than 0.3°C for time scales of about half a century and cumulative CO2 emissions broadly 
consistent with global warming of 2°C. However, there is low confidence about its sign on time scales of 
about half a century. For lower cumulative CO2 emissions, the range would be smaller yet with equal 
uncertainty about the sign. If the ZEC is positive on decadal time scales, additional warming leads to a 
reduction in the estimates of remaining carbon budgets, and vice versa if it is negative. {4.7.1, 5.5.2} 
 
Permafrost thaw is included in estimates together with other feedbacks that are often not captured by models. 
Limitations in modelling studies combined with weak observational constraints only allow low confidence in 
the magnitude of these estimates (TS.3.2.2). Despite the large uncertainties surrounding the quantification of 
the effect of additional Earth system feedback processes, such as emissions from wetlands and permafrost 
thaw, these feedbacks represent identified additional risk factors that scale with additional warming and 
mostly increase the challenge of limiting warming to specific temperature levels. These uncertainties do not 
change the basic conclusion that global CO2 emissions would need to decline to net zero to halt global 
warming. {Box 5.1, 5.4.8, 5.5.2} 

### TS.3.3.2   Carbon Dioxide Removal 

Deliberate carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere has the potential to compensate for residual 
CO2 emissions to reach net zero CO2 emissions or to generate net negative CO2 emissions. In the same way 
that part of current anthropogenic net CO2 emissions are taken up by land and ocean carbon stores, net CO2 
removal will be partially counteracted by CO2 release from these stores (very high confidence). Asymmetry 
in the carbon cycle response to simultaneous CO2 emissions and removals implies that a larger amount of 
CO2 would need to be removed to compensate for an emission of a given magnitude to attain the same 
change in atmospheric CO2 (medium confidence). CDR methods have wide-ranging side-effects that can 
either weaken or strengthen the carbon sequestration and cooling potential of these methods and affect the 
achievement of sustainable development goals (high confidence). {4.6.3, 5.6} 

Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) refers to anthropogenic activities that deliberately remove CO2 from the 
atmosphere and durably store it in geological, terrestrial or ocean reservoirs, or in products. Carbon dioxide 
is removed from the atmosphere by enhancing biological or geochemical carbon sinks or by direct capture of 
CO2 from air. Emission pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C typically assume the use of 
CDR approaches in combination with GHG emissions reductions. CDR approaches could be used to 
compensate for residual emissions from sectors that are difficult or costly to decarbonize. CDR could also be 
implemented at a large scale to generate global net negative CO2 emissions (i.e., anthropogenic CO2 
removals exceeding anthropogenic emissions), which could compensate for earlier emissions as a way to 
meet long-term climate stabilization goals after a temperature overshoot. This Report assesses the effects of 
CDR on the carbon cycle and climate. Co-benefits and trade-offs for biodiversity, water and food production 
are briefly discussed for completeness, but a comprehensive assessment of the ecological and socio-
economic dimensions of CDR options is left to the WGII and WGIII reports. {4.6.3, 5.6} 
 
CDR methods have the potential to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere (high confidence). In the same way 
part of current anthropogenic net CO2 emissions are taken up by land and ocean carbon stores, net CO2 
removal will be partially counteracted by CO2 release from these stores, such that the amount of CO2 
sequestered by CDR will not result in an equivalent drop in atmospheric CO2 (very high confidence). The 
fraction of CO2 removed from the atmosphere that is not replaced by CO2 released from carbon stores, a 
measure of CDR effectiveness, decreases slightly with increasing amounts of removal (medium confidence) 
and decreases strongly if CDR is applied at lower atmospheric CO2 concentrations (medium confidence). The 
reduction in global surface temperature is approximately linearly related to cumulative CO2 removal (high 
confidence). Because of this near-linear relationship, the amount of cooling per unit CO2 removed is 
approximately independent of the rate and amount of removal (medium confidence). {4.6.3, 5.6.2.1, Figure 
5.32, Figure 5.34} 
 
Due to non-linearities in the climate system, the century-scale climate–carbon cycle response to a CO2 
removal from the atmosphere is not always equal and opposite to its response to a simultaneous CO2 
emission (medium confidence). For CO2 emissions of 100 PgC released from a pre-industrial from a state in 
equilibrium with pre-industrial atmospheric CO2 levels, CMIP6 models simulate that 27± 6% (mean ± 1 
standard deviation) of emissions remain in the atmosphere 80–100 years after the emissions, whereas for 
removals of 100 PgC only 23 ± 6% of removals remain out of the atmosphere. This asymmetry implies that 
an extra amount of CDR is required to compensate for a positive emission of a given magnitude to attain the 
same change in atmospheric CO2. Due to limited agreement between models, there is low confidence in the 
sign of the asymmetry of the temperature response to CO2 emissions and removals. {4.6.3, 5.6.2.1, Figure 
5.35} 
 
Simulations with ESMs indicate that under scenarios where CO2 emissions gradually decline, reach net zero 
and become net negative during the 21st century (e.g., SSP1–2.6), land and ocean carbon sinks begin to 
weaken in response to declining atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and the land sink eventually turns into a 
source (Figure TS.19). This sink-to-source transition occurs decades to a few centuries after CO2 emissions 
become net negative. The ocean remains a sink of CO2 for centuries after emissions become net negative. 
Under scenarios with large net negative CO2 emissions (e.g., SSP5–3.4–OS) and rapidly declining CO2 
concentrations, the land source is larger than for SSP1–2.6 and the ocean also switches to a source. While the 
general response is robust across models, there is low confidence in the timing of the sink-to-source 
transition and the magnitude of the CO2 source in scenarios with net negative CO2 emissions. Carbon dioxide 
removal could reverse some aspects climate change if CO2 emissions become net negative, but some changes 
would continue in their current direction for decades to millennia. For instance, sea level rise due to ocean 
thermal expansion would not reverse for several centuries to millennia (high confidence) (Box TS.4). {4.6.3, 
5.4.10, 5.6.2.1, Figure 5.30, Figure 5.33} 
 
<figref>TS.19</figref> 
 
CDR methods have a range of side effects that can either weaken or strengthen the carbon sequestration and 
cooling potential of these methods and affect the achievement of sustainable development goals (high 
confidence). Biophysical and biogeochemical side-effects of CDR methods are associated with changes in 
surface albedo, the water cycle, emissions of CH4 and N2O, ocean acidification and marine ecosystem 
productivity (high confidence). These side-effects and associated Earth system feedbacks can decrease 
carbon uptake and/or change local and regional climate and in turn limit the CO2 sequestration and cooling 
potential of specific CDR methods (medium confidence). Deployment of CDR, particularly on land, can also 
affect water quality and quantity, food production and biodiversity (high confidence). These effects are often 
highly dependent on local context, management regime, prior land use, and scale (high confidence). The 
largest co-benefits are obtained with methods that seek to restore natural ecosystems or improve soil carbon 
sequestration (medium confidence). The climate and biogeochemical effects of terminating CDR are 
expected to be small for most CDR methods (medium confidence). {4.6.3, 5.6.2.2, 8.4.3, 8.6.3, Figure 5.36} 

### TS.3.3.3   Relating Different Forcing Agents 
 
When including other GHGs, the choice of emission metric affects the quantification of net zero GHG 
emissions and their resulting temperature outcome (high confidence). Reaching and sustaining net zero GHG 
emissions typically leads to a peak and decline in temperatures when quantified with the global warming 
potential over a 100-year period (GWP-100). Carbon-cycle responses are more robustly accounted for in 
emission metrics compared to AR5 (high confidence). New emission metric approaches can be used to 
generate equivalent cumulative emissions of CO2 for short-lived greenhouse gases based on their rate of 
emissions. {7.6.2} 
 
Over 10- to 20-year time scales, the temperature response to a single year’s worth of current emissions of 
SLCFs is at least as large as that of CO2, but because the effect of SLCFs decays rapidly over the first few 
decades after emission, the net long-term temperature response to a single year’s worth of emissions is 
predominantly determined by cumulative CO2 emissions. Emission reductions in 2020 associated with 
COVID-19 containment led to small and positive global ERF; however, global and regional climate 
responses to the forcing are undetectable above internal variability due to the temporary nature of emission 
reductions. {6.6, Cross-Chapter Box 6.1} 

The relative climate effects of different forcing agents are typically quantified using emission metrics that 
compare the effects of an idealised pulse of 1 kg of some climate forcing agent against a reference climate 
forcing agent, almost always CO2. The two most prominent pulse emissions metrics are the global warming 
potential (GWP) and global temperature change potential (GTP) (see Glossary). The climate responses to 
CO2 emissions by convention include the effects of warming on the carbon cycle, so for consistency these 
need to be determined also for non-CO2 emissions. The methodology for doing this has been placed on a 
more robust scientific footing compared to AR5 (high confidence). Methane from fossil fuel sources has 
slightly higher emission metric values than those from biogenic sources since it leads to additional fossil CO2 
in the atmosphere (high confidence). Updates to the chemical adjustments for methane and nitrous oxide 
emissions (Section TS.3.1) and revisions in their lifetimes result in emission metrics for GWP and GTP that 
are slightly lower than in AR5 (medium confidence). Emission metrics for the entire suite of GHGs assessed 
in the AR6 have been calculated for various time horizons. {7.6.1, Table 7.15, Table 7.SM.7} 
 
New emission metric approaches, such as GWP* and Combined-GTP (CGTP), relate changes in the 
emission rate of short-lived greenhouse gases to equivalent cumulative emissions of CO2 (cumulative CO2-e 
emissions). Global surface temperature response from aggregated emissions of short-lived greenhouse gases 
over time is determined by multiplying these cumulative CO2-e by TCRE (see TS.3.2.1). When GHGs are 
aggregated using standard metrics such as GWP or GTP, cumulative CO2-e emissions are not necessarily 
proportional to future global surface temperature outcomes (high confidence) {Box 7.3, 7.6.1} 
 
Emission metrics are needed to aggregate baskets of gases to determine net zero GHG emissions. Generally, 
achieving net zero CO2 emissions and declining non-CO2 radiative forcing would halt human-induced 
warming. Reaching net zero GHG emissions quantified by GWP-100 typically leads to declining 
temperatures after net zero GHGs emissions are achieved if the basket includes short-lived gases, such as 
methane. Net zero GHG emissions defined by CGTP or GWP* imply net zero CO2 and other long-lived 
GHG emissions and constant (CGTP) or gradually declining (GWP*) emissions of short-lived gases. The 
warming evolution resulting from net zero GHG emissions defined in this way corresponds approximately to 
reaching net zero CO2 emissions, and would thus not lead to declining temperatures after net zero GHG 
emissions are achieved but to an approximate temperature stabilization (high confidence). The choice of 
emission metric hence affects the quantification of net zero GHG emissions, and therefore the resulting 
temperature outcome of reaching and sustaining net zero GHG emissions levels (high confidence). {7.6.1.4, 
7.6.2, 7.6.3} 
 
As pointed out in AR5, ultimately, it is a matter for policymakers to decide which emission metric is most 
applicable to their needs. This Report does not recommend the use of any specific emission metric as the 
most appropriate metric depends on the policy goal and context (see Chapter 7, Section 7.6). A detailed 
assessment of GHG metrics to support climate change mitigation and associated policy contexts is provided 
in the WGIII contribution to the AR6. 
 
The global surface temperature response following a climate change mitigation measure that affects 
emissions of both short- and long-lived climate forcers depends on their lifetimes, their ERFs, how fast and 
for how long the emissions are reduced, and the thermal inertia in the climate system. Mitigation, relying on 
emission reductions and implemented through new legislation or technology standards, implies that 
emissions reductions occur year after year. Global temperature response to a year’s worth of current 
emissions from different sectors informs about the mitigation potential (Figure TS.20). Over 10- to 20-year 
time scales, the influence of SLCFs is at least as large as that of CO2, with sectors producing the largest 
warming being fossil fuel production and distribution, agriculture, and waste management. Because the 
effect of the SLCFs decays rapidly over the first few decades after emission, the net long-term temperature 
effect from a single year’s worth of current emissions is predominantly determined by CO2. Fossil fuel 
combustion for energy, industry and land transportation are the largest contributing sectors on a 100-year 
time scale (high confidence). Current emissions of CO2, N2O and SLCFs from East Asia and North America 
are the largest regional contributors to additional net future warming on both short (medium confidence) and 
long time scales (10 and 100 year) (high confidence). {6.6.1, 6.6.2, Figure 6.16} 
 
COVID-19 restrictions led to detectable reductions in global anthropogenic NOx (about 35% in April 2020) 
and fossil CO2 (7%, with estimates ranging from 5.8% to 13.0%) emissions, driven largely by reduced 
emissions from the transportation sector (medium confidence). There is high confidence that, with the 
exception of surface ozone, reductions in pollutant precursors contributed to temporarily improved air 
quality in most regions of the world. However, these reductions were lower than that would be expected 
from sustained implementation of policies addressing air quality and climate change (medium confidence). 
Overall, the net global ERF from COVID-19 containment was likely small and positive for 2020 (with a 
temporary peak value less than 0.2 W m–2), thus temporarily adding to the total anthropogenic climate 
influence, with positive forcing (warming influence) from aerosol changes dominating over negative 
forcings (cooling influence) from CO2, NOx and contrail cirrus changes. Consistent with this small net 
radiative forcing, and against a large component of internal variability, Earth system models show no 
detectable effect on global or regional surface temperature or precipitation (high confidence). {Cross Chapter

# TS.4  Regional Climate Change 
 
This section  focuses on  how  to  generate regional  climate  change  information and  its relevance  for  climate 
services;  the  drivers  of  regional  climate  variability  and  change,  and  how  they  are  being  affected  by 
anthropogenic factors; and observed, attributed and projected changes in climate, including extreme events 
and climatic impact-drivers (CID), across all regions of the world. There is a small set of CID changes common 
to all land or ocean regions and a specific set of changes from a broader range of CIDs seen in each region. 
This regional diversity results from regional climate being determined by a complex interplay between the 
seasonal-to-multidecadal  variation  of  large-scale  modes  of  climate  variability,  external  natural  and 
anthropogenic forcings, local climate processes and related feedbacks.  
 
 
## TS.4.1  Generation and Communication of Regional Climate Change Information 
 

Climate change information at regional scale is generated using a range of data sources and methodologies. 
Multi-model  ensembles  and  models  with  a  range  of resolutions  are  important  data  sources,  and  discarding 
models that fundamentally misrepresent relevant processes improves the credibility of ensemble information 
related to these processes. A key methodology is distillation, combining lines of evidence and accounting for 
stakeholder context and values, which helps ensure the information is relevant, useful and trusted for decision 
making (see Core Concepts Box) (high confidence). Since the AR5, physical climate storylines have emerged 
as a complementary approach to ensemble projections to generate more accessible climate information  and 
promote a more comprehensive treatment of risk. They have been used as part of the distillation process within 
climate services to generate the required context-relevant, credible and trusted climate information. Since AR5, 
climate  change  information  produced  for  climate  services  has  increased  significantly  due  to  scientific  and 
technological advancements and growing user awareness, requirements, and demand (very high confidence). 
The  decision-making context, level of user  engagement  and  co-production  between scientists,  practitioners 
and  users  are  important  determinants  of  the  type  of  climate  service  developed  and  its  utility  in  supporting 
adaptation, mitigation and risk management decisions. {Box TS.1, 10.3, Cross-Chapter Box 10.3, 10.6, 12.6, 
Cross-chapter Box 12.2, Box TS.3} 

### TS.4.1.1  Sources and Methodologies for Generating Regional Climate Information 
 
Climate change information at regional scale is generated using a range of data sources and methodologies 
(TS.1.4).  Understanding  observed  regional  climate  change  and  variability  is  based  on  the  availability  and 
analysis  of  multiple  observational  datasets  that  are  suitable  for  evaluating  the  phenomena  of  interest  (e.g., 
extreme events), including accounting for observational uncertainty. These datasets are combined with climate 
model simulations of observed changes and events to attribute causes of those changes and events to large- 
and  regional-scale  anthropogenic  and  natural  drivers  and  to  assess  the  performance  of  the  models.  Future 
simulations with many climate models (multi-model ensembles) are then used to generate and quantify ranges 
of projected regional climate responses. Discarding models that fundamentally misrepresent relevant processes 
improves the credibility of regional climate information generated from these ensembles (high confidence). 
However, multi-model mean and ensemble spread are not a full measure of the range of projection uncertainty 
and  are  not  sufficient  to  characterize  low-likelihood,  high-impact  changes  (Box  TS.3)  or  situations  where 
different  models  simulate  substantially  different  or  even  opposite changes (high confidence).  Large single-
model  ensembles  are  now  available  and  provide  a  more  comprehensive  spectrum  of  possible  changes 
associated with internal variability (high confidence). {1.5.1, 1.5.4, 10.2, 10.3.3, 10.3.4, 10.4.1, 10.6.2, 11.2, 
Box 11.2, Cross-chapter Box 11.1, 12.4, Atlas.1.4.1, TS.1.2.1, TS.1.2.3, TS.4.2} 
 
Depending on the region of interest, representing regionally important forcings (e.g., aerosols, land-use change 
and ozone concentrations) and feedbacks (e.g., between snow and albedo, soil-moisture and temperature, soil-
moisture and precipitation) in climate models is a prerequisite for them to reproduce past regional trends  to 
underpin the reliability of future projections (medium confidence). In some cases, even the sign of a projected 
change in regional climate cannot be trusted if relevant regional processes are not represented, for example, 
for variables such as precipitation and wind speed (medium confidence). In some regions, either geographical 
(e.g., Central Africa, Antarctica) or typological (e.g., mountainous areas,  Small Islands and cities), and for 
certain phenomena, fewer observational records are available or accessible, which limits the assessment of 
regional  climate  change  in  these  cases.  {1.5.1,  1.5.3,  1.5.4,  8.5.1,  10.2,  10.3.3,  10.4.1,  11.1.6,  11.2,  12.4, 
Atlas.8.3, Atlas.11.1.5, Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.2, TS.1.2.2} 
 
Methodologies such as statistical downscaling, bias adjustment and weather generators are beneficial as an 
interface between climate model projections and impact modelling and for deriving user-relevant indicators 
(high confidence). However, the performance of these techniques depends on that of the driving climate model: 
in  particular,  bias  adjustment  cannot  overcome  all  consequences  of  unresolved  or  strongly  misrepresented 
physical  processes  such  as  large-scale  circulation  biases  or  local  feedbacks  (medium  confidence).  {10.3.3, 
Cross-Chapter Box 10.2, 12.2, Atlas.2.2} 
 
<boxref>Box TS.10</boxref> 
 
### TS.4.1.2  Regional Climate Information Distillation and Climate Services 
 
The construction of regional climate information involves people with a variety of backgrounds, from various 
disciplines, who have different sets of experiences, capabilities and values. The process of synthesizing climate 
information from different lines of evidence from a number of sources, taking into account the context of a 
user vulnerable to climate variability and change and the values of all relevant actors, is called distillation. 
Distillation  is  conditioned  by  the  sources  available,  the  actors  involved  and  the  context,  which  all  depend 
heavily on the regions considered, and framed by the question being addressed.  Distilling regional climate 
information  from  multiple  lines  of  evidence  and  taking  the  user  context  into  account  increases  fitness, 
usefulness, relevance and trust in that information for use in climate services (Box TS.11) and decision-making 
(high confidence). {1.2.3, 10.1.4, 10.5, Cross-Chapter Box 10.3, 12.6} 
 
The  distillation  process  can  vary  substantially,  as  it  needs  to  consider  multiple  lines  of  evidence  on  all 
physically plausible outcomes (especially when they are contrasting) relevant to a specific decision required 
in response to a changing climate. Confidence in the distilled regional climate information is enhanced when 
there is agreement across multiple lines of evidence, so the outcome can be limited if these are inconsistent or 
contradictory. For example, in the Mediterranean  region the agreement between different lines of evidence 
such  as  observations,  projections  by  regional  and  global  models,  and  understanding  of  the  underlying 
mechanisms provides high confidence in summer warming that exceeds the global average (see Box TS.12). 
In a less clear-cut case for Cape Town, despite consistency among global model future projections, there is 
medium confidence in a projected future drier climate due to the lack of consistency in links between increasing 
greenhouse gases, changes in a key mode of variability (the Southern Annular Mode) and drought in Cape 
Town  among  different  observation  periods  and  in  model  simulations.  {10.5.3,  10.6,  10.6.2,  10.6.4,  Cross-
Chapter Box 10.3, 12.4} 
 
Since the AR5, physical climate storyline approaches have emerged as a complementary instrument to provide 
a different perspective on or additional climate information, to facilitate communication of the information or 
provide a more flexible consideration of risk. Storylines that condition climatic events and processes on a set 
of plausible but distinct large-scale climatic changes enable the exploration of uncertainties in regional climate 
projections. For example, they can explicitly address low-likelihood, high-impact outcomes, which would be 
less emphasized in a probabilistic approach, and can be embedded in a user’s risk landscape, taking account 
of socio-economic factors as well as physical climate changes. Storylines can also be used to communicate 
climate information by narrative elements describing and contextualising the main climatological features and 
the  relevant  consequences  in  the  user  context  and,  as  such,  can  be  used  as  part  of  a  climate  information 
distillation process. {1.4.4., Box 10.2, Box 11.2, 11.2, Cross-chapter Box 12.2}

## TS.4.2  Drivers of Regional Climate Variability and Change 
 
Anthropogenic forcing, including GHGs and aerosols but also regional land use and irrigation have all affected 
observed regional climate changes (high confidence) and will continue to do so in the future (high confidence), 
with various degrees of influence and response times, depending on warming levels, the nature of the forcing 
and  the  relative  importance  of  internal  variability.  Since  the  late  19th  century,  major  modes  of  variability 
(MoVs) exhibited fluctuations in frequency and magnitude at multi-decadal time scales, but no sustained trends 
outside the range of internal variability (Table TS.4). An exception is the  Southern Annular Mode (SAM), 
which has become systematically more positive (high confidence) and is projected to be more positive in all 
seasons, except for  December-January-February (DJF), in high CO2 emissions scenarios (high confidence). 
The  influence  of  stratospheric  ozone  forcing  on  the  SAM  trend  has  been  reduced  since  the  early  2000s 
compared to earlier decades, contributing to the weakening of its positive trend as observed over 2000–2019 
(medium confidence). In the near-term, projected changes in most of the MoVs and related teleconnections 
will likely be dominated by internal variability. In the long-term, it is very likely that the precipitation variance 
related  to  El  Niño–Southern  Oscillation  will  increase.  Physical  climate  storylines,  including  the  complex 
interplay  between  climate  drivers,  MoVs,  and  local  and  remote  forcing,  increase  confidence  in  the 
understanding and use of observed and projected regional changes. {2.4, 3.7, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 6.4, 8.3, 8.4, 10.3, 
10.4, 11.3} 
 
### TS.4.2.1  Regional Fingerprints of Anthropogenic and Natural Forcing 
 
While anthropogenic forcing has contributed to multi-decadal mean precipitation changes in several regions, 
internal  variability  can  delay  emergence  of  the  anthropogenic  signal  in  long-term  precipitation  changes  in 
many  land  regions  (high  confidence).  At  the  regional  scale,  the  effect  of  human-induced  GHG  forcing  on 
extreme temperature is moderated or amplified by soil moisture feedback, snow/ice-albedo feedback, regional 
forcing  from  land-use/land-cover  changes,  forcing  from  aerosol  concentrations,  or  decadal/multi-decadal 
natural variability. Changes in local and remote aerosol forcings lead to south-north gradients of the effective 
radiative  forcing  (ERF)  (hemispherical  asymmetry).  Along  latitudes,  it  is  more  uniform  with  strong 
amplification  of  the  temperature  response  towards  the  Arctic  (medium  confidence).  The  decrease  of  SO2 
emissions since the 1980s reduces the damping effect of aerosols, leading to a faster increase in surface air 
temperature that is most pronounced at mid- and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, where the largest 
emission reductions have taken place (medium confidence). {1.3, 3.4.1, 6.3.4, 6.4.1, 6.4.3, 8.3.1, 8.3.2, Box 
8.1, 10.4.2, 10.6, 11.1.6, 11.3} 
 
Multidecadal dimming and brightening trends in incoming solar radiation at the Earth’s surface occurred at 
widespread  locations  (high  confidence).  Multi-decadal  variation  in  anthropogenic  aerosol  emissions  are 
thought to be a major contributor (medium confidence), but multi-decadal variability in cloudiness may also 
have played a role. Volcanic eruptions affect regional climate through their spatially heterogeneous effect on 
the radiative budget as well as through triggering dynamical responses by favouring a given phase from some 
MoVs, for instance. {1.4.1, Cross-Chapter Box 1.2, 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 3.7.1, 3.7.3, 4.3.1, 4.4.1, 4.4.4, Cross-Chapter 
Box 4.1, 7.2.2, 8.5.2, 10.1.4, 11.1.6, 11.3.1} 
 
Historical  urbanization  affects  the  observed  warming  trends  in  cities  and  their  surroundings  (very  high 
confidence).  Future  urbanization  will  amplify  the  projected  air  temperature  under  different  background 
climates, with a strong effect on minimum temperatures that could be as large as the global warming signal 
(very high confidence). Irrigation and crop expansion have attenuated increases in summer hot extremes in 
some regions, such as central North America (medium confidence). {Box 10.3, 11.1.6, 11.3, Box TS.6, Box 
TS.14} 
 
 
### TS.4.2.2  Modes of Variability and Regional Teleconnections 
 
Modes of Variability (MoVs) (Annex IV, Table TS.4) have existed for millennia or longer (high confidence), 
but there is low confidence in detailed reconstructions of most of them prior to direct instrumental records. 
MoVs  are  treated  as  a  main  source  of  uncertainties  associated  with  internal  dynamics,  as  they  can  either 
accentuate  or  dampen,  even  mask,  the  anthropogenically-forced  responses.  {2.4,  8.5.2,  10.4,  10.6,  11.1.5, 
Atlas.3.1} 
  
Since the late 19th century, major MoVs (Table TS.4) show no  sustained trends, exhibiting fluctuations in 
frequency and magnitude at multi-decadal time scales, except for the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), which 
has become systematically more positive (high confidence) (Table TS.4). It is very likely that human influence 
has contributed to this trend from the 1970s to the 1990s, and to the associated strengthening and southward 
shift of the Southern Hemispheric extratropical jet in austral summer. The influence of stratospheric ozone 
forcing on the SAM trend has been reduced since the early 2000s compared to earlier decades, contributing to 
the weakening of its positive trend observed over 2000–2019 (medium confidence). By contrast, the cause of 
the Northern Annular Mode (NAM) trend toward its positive phase since the 1960s and associated northward 
shifts of Northern Hemispheric extratropical jet and storm track in boreal winter is not well understood. The 
evaluation of model performance on simulating MoVs is assessed in TS.1.2.2. {2.3.3, 2.4, 3.3.3, 3.7.1, 3.7.2}  
  
In the near term, the forced change in SAM in austral summer is likely to be weaker than observed during the 
late 20th century under all five SSPs assessed. This is because of the opposing influence in the near- to mid-
term from stratospheric ozone recovery and increases in other greenhouse gases on the Southern Hemisphere 
summertime mid-latitude circulation (high confidence). In the near term, forced changes in the SAM in austral 
summer  are therefore  likely  to be smaller  than  changes  due  to  natural internal  variability.  In the long-term 
(2081–2100) under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, the SAM index is likely to increase in all seasons relative to 1995–
2014. The CMIP6 multi-model ensemble projects a long-term (2081–2100) increase in the boreal wintertime 
NAM index under SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, but regional associated changes may deviate from a simple shift in 
the mid-latitude circulation due to a modified teleconnection resulting from interaction with a modified mean 
background state. {4.3.3, 4.4.3, 4.5.1, 4.5.3, 8.4.2} 
  
Human influence has not affected the principal tropical modes of interannual climate variability (Table TS.4) 
and their associated regional teleconnections beyond the range of internal variability (high confidence). It is 
virtually certain that the ENSO will remain the dominant mode of interannual variability in a warmer world. 
There is no consensus from models for a systematic change in amplitude of ENSO SST variability over the 
21st century in any of the SSP scenarios assessed (medium confidence). However, it is very likely that rainfall 
variability related to ENSO will be enhanced significantly by the latter half of the 21st century in the SSP2-
4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, regardless of the amplitude changes in SST variability related to the 
mode It is very likely that rainfall variability related to changes in the strength and spatial extent of  ENSO 
teleconnections will lead to significant changes at regional scale. {3.7.3, 3.7.4, 3.7.5, 4.3.3, 4.5.3, 8.4.2, 10.3.3} 
  
Modes  of  decadal  and  multidecadal  variability  over  the  Pacific  and  Atlantic  Ocean  exhibit  no  significant 
changes in variance over the period of observational records (high confidence). There is medium confidence 
that  anthropogenic  and  volcanic  aerosols  contributed  to  observed  temporal  evolution  in  the  Atlantic 
Multidecadal Variability (AMV) and associated regional teleconnections, especially since the 1960s, but there 
is low confidence in the magnitude of this influence and the relative contributions of natural and anthropogenic 
forcings. Internal variability is the main driver of Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV) observed since the start 
of  the  instrumental  records  (high  confidence),  despite  some  modelling  evidence  for  potential  external 
influence. There is medium confidence that the AMV will undergo a shift towards a negative phase in the near-
term. {2.4, 3.7.6, 3.7.7, 8.5.2, 4.4.3} 
 
<tableref>TS.4</tableref>
 
### TS.4.2.3  Interplay Between Drivers of Climate Variability and Change at Regional Scales 
 
Anthropogenic  forcing  has  been  a  major  driver  of  regional  mean  temperature  change  since  1950  in  many 
subcontinental regions of the world (virtually certain). At regional scales, internal variability is stronger, and 
uncertainties in observations, models and external forcing are all larger than at the global scale,  hindering a 
robust assessment of the relative contributions of greenhouse gases, stratospheric ozone, and different aerosol 
species in most of the cases. Multiple lines of evidence, combining multi-model ensemble global projections 
with those coming from single-model initial-condition large ensembles, show that internal variability is largely 
contributing  to  the  delayed  or  absent  emergence  of  the  anthropogenic  signal  in  long-term  regional  mean 
precipitation changes (high confidence). Internal variability in ocean dynamics dominates regional patterns on 
annual to decadal time scales (high confidence). The anthropogenic signal in regional sea level change will 
emerge in most regions by 2100 (medium confidence). {9.2.4, 9.6.1, 10.4.1, 10.4.2, 10.4.3} 
 
Regional climate change is subject to the complex interplay between multiple external forcings and internal 
variability. Time evolution of mechanisms operating at different time scales can modify the amplitude of the 
regional-scale response of temperature, and both the amplitude and sign of the response of precipitation, to 
anthropogenic forcing (high confidence). These mechanisms include non-linear temperature, precipitation and 
soil  moisture  feedbacks,  slow  and  fast  responses  of  SST  patterns  and  atmospheric  circulation  changes  to 
increasing  GHGs.  Land  use  and  aerosol  forcings  and  land–atmosphere  feedback  play  important  roles  in 
modulating regional changes, for instance in weather and climate extremes (high confidence). These can also 
lead  to  a  higher  warming  of  extreme  temperatures  compared  to  mean  temperature  (high  confidence),  and 
possibly cooling in some regions (medium confidence). The soil moisture–temperature feedback was shown 
to  be  relevant  for  past  and  present-day  heat  waves  based  on  observations  and  model  simulations.  {10.4.3, 
11.1.6, 11.3.1} 
 
Southeastern South America (SES) is one of the AR6 WGI reference regions (outlined with black thick contour 
in Figure TS.21a) and it is used here as an illustrative example of the interplay between drivers of climate 
variability  and  change  at  regional  scale.  Austral  summer  (DJF)  precipitation  positive  trends  have  been 
observed over the region during 1950–2014. Drivers of this change include MoVs, such as AMV, ENSO, and 
PDV, as well as external forcing, like GHG increases and ozone depletion together with aerosols (as illustrated 
in Figure TS.21a). MoVs and external forcing collectively affect climate phenomena, such as the Hadley cell 
width  and  strength,  Rossby  waves  activity  emerging  from  the  large-scale  tropical  SST  anomalies,  and  the 
Southern Hemisphere polar vortex, which are relevant for the region. In fact, local changes over SES in terms 
of moisture convergence, ascending motion and storm-track locations depend on these climate phenomena, 
and they are overall responsible for the observed precipitation trends. Projections suggest continuing positive 
trends in rainfall over SES in the near-term in response to GHG emissions scenarios. Multi-model mean and 
ensemble  spread  are  not  sufficient  to  characterise  situations  where  different  models  simulate  substantially 
different  or even  opposite changes  (high  confidence).  In  such  cases,  physical  climate  storylines  addressing 
possible outcomes for climate phenomena shown to play a role in the variability of the region of interest can 
aid the interpretation of projection uncertainties. In addition, single-model initial-condition large ensembles of 
many realisations of internal variability are required to separate internal variability from forced changes (high 
confidence)  and  to  partition  the  different  sources  of  uncertainties  as  a  function  of  future  assessed  periods.

## TS.4.3  Regional Climate Change and Implications for Climate Extremes and Climatic Impact-Drivers 
 
Current climate in all regions is already distinct from the climate of the early or mid-20th century with respect 
to several climatic impact-drivers (CIDs), resulting in shifting magnitude, frequency, duration, seasonality, 
and spatial extent of associated climate indices (high confidence). It is very likely that mean temperatures have 
increased  in  all  land  regions  and  will  continue  to  increase  at  rates  greater  than  the  global  average  (high 
confidence).  The  frequency  of  heat  and  cold  extremes  have  increased  and  decreased,  respectively.  These 
changes are attributed to human influence in almost all regions (medium to high confidence) and will continue 
through the 21st century (high confidence). In particular, extreme heat would exceed critical thresholds for 
health, agriculture and other sectors more frequently by the mid 21st century with 2°C of global warming (high 
confidence).  Relative sea  level  rise is  very likely to  virtually  certain  (depending  on the  region)  to  continue 
during the 21st century, contributing to increased coastal flooding in low-lying areas (high confidence) and 
coastal erosion along most sandy coasts (high confidence). Sea level will continue to rise beyond 2100 (high 
confidence). Every region of the world will experience concurrent changes in multiple CIDs by mid-century 
(high confidence). Even for the current climate, climate change-induced shifts in CID distributions and event 
probabilities, some of which have occurred over recent decades, are relevant for risk assessments.{Box TS.4, 
11.9, 12.1, 12.2, 12.4, 12.5, Atlas.3–Atlas.11} 

 
An  overview  of  changes  in  regional  CIDs  (introduced  in  TS.1)  is  given in  Table  TS.5,  which  summarizes 
multiple lines of evidence on regional climate change derived from observed trends, attribution of these trends 
and future projections. The level of confidence and the amplitude in the projected direction of change in CIDs 
at a given time-horizon depends on climate change mitigation efforts over the 21st century. It is evident from 
Table  TS.5  that  many  heat,  cold,  snow  and  ice,  coastal  and  oceanic  CID  changes  are  projected  with  high 
confidence  in  most  regions  starting  from  a  global  warming  level  (GWL)  of  2°C,  indicating  worldwide 
challenges. Changes in many other regional CIDs have higher confidence later in the 21st century or at higher 
GWLs (high confidence), and another small subset are projected with  high confidence for the 1.5°C GWL. 
This section focuses on the 2°C GWL and mid-century time period because the signal emerges from natural 
variability  for  a  wider  range  of  CIDs  at  this  higher  warming  level.  Figure  TS.22  shows  the  geographical 
location  of  regions  belonging  to  one  of  five  groups  characterized  by  a  specific  combination  of  changing 
climatic impact-drivers (CIDs). {Cross-Chapter Box 10.3, Box 11.1, 10.5, 11.1, 11.9, 12.1, 12.2, 12.4, 12.5}

### TS.4.3.1  Common Regional Changes in Climatic Impact-Drivers 
 
*Heat and cold:* Changes in temperature-related CIDs such as mean temperatures, growing season length, and 
extreme  heat  and  frost  have  already  occurred  (high  confidence),  and  many  of  these  changes  have  been 
attributed to human activities (medium confidence). Over all land regions with sufficient data (i.e., all except 
Antarctica),  observed  changes  in  temperature  have  already  clearly  emerged  outside  the  range  of  internal 
variability,  relative  to  1850–1900  (Figure  TS.24).  In  tropical  regions,  recent  past  temperature  distributions 
have already shifted to a range different to that of the early 20th century (high confidence) (TS.1.2.4). Most 
land areas have very likely warmed by at least 0.1°C per decade since 1960, and faster in recent decades. On 
regional-to-continental scales, trends of increased frequency of hot extremes and decrease of cold extremes 
are generally consistent with the global-scale trends in mean temperature (high confidence). In a few regions, 
trends are difficult to assess due to limited data availability. {2.3.1.1, 11.3, 11.9, 12.4, Atlas.3.1, Interactive 
Atlas} 
 
<figref>TS.23</figref> 

Warming trends observed in recent decades are projected to continue over the 21st century and over most land 
regions at a rate higher than the global average (high confidence). For given global warming levels, model 
projections from CMIP6 show future regional warming changes that are similar to those projected by CMIP5. 
However, projected regional warming in CMIP6 for given time periods and emissions scenarios has a wider 
range with a higher upper limit compared to CMIP5 because of the higher climate sensitivity in some CMIP6 
models and differences in the forcings. {Atlas} 
 
Under  RCP8.5/SSP5-8.5,  it  is  likely  that  most  land  areas  will  experience  further  warming  of  at  least  4°C 
compared to a 1995–2014 baseline by the end of the 21st century, and in some areas significantly more. At 
increasing warming levels, extreme heat will exceed critical thresholds for health, agriculture and other sectors 
more frequently (high confidence), and it is likely that cold spells will become less frequent towards the end 
of  the  century.  For  example,  by the  end of the  21st  century,  dangerous  humid  heat thresholds,  such  as the 
NOAA Heat Index (HI) of 41°C, will be exceeded much more frequently under the SSP5-8.5 scenario than 
under SSP1-2.6 and will affect many regions (high confidence). In many tropical regions, the number of days 
per year where a HI of 41°C is exceeded  would increase by more than 100 days relative to the recent past 
under  SSP5-8.5,  while  this  increase  will  be  limited  to  less than  50  days  under  SSP1-2.6  (high  confidence) 
(Figure TS.6). The number of days per year where temperature exceeds 35°C would increase by more than 150 
days in many tropical areas by end of century for SSP5-8.5 scenario, such as the Amazon basin and South East 
Asia under SSP5-8.5, while it is expected to increase by less than 60 days in these areas under SSP1-2.6 (except 
for the Amazon Basin) (high confidence) (Figure TS.24). {4.6.1, 11.3, 11.9, 12.4, 12.5.2, Atlas}  
 
<figref>TS.24</figref> 
 
*Wet and dry:* Compared to the global scale, precipitation internal variability is stronger at the regional scale 
while  uncertainties  in  observations, models  and  external forcing  are  all  larger. However,  GHG  forcing  has 
driven increased contrasts in precipitation amounts between wet and dry seasons and weather regimes over 
tropical land areas (medium confidence), with a detectable precipitation increase in the northern high latitudes 
(high confidence) (Box TS.6). The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased over 
a majority of land regions with good observational coverage (high confidence). A majority of land areas have 
experienced decreases in available water in dry seasons due to human-induced climate change associated with 
changes in evapotranspiration (medium confidence). Global hydrological models project a larger fraction of 
land areas to be affected by an increase rather than by a decrease in river floods (medium confidence). Extreme 
precipitation  and pluvial  flooding  will  increase  in many  regions  around the  world  on  almost  all  continents 
(high  confidence),  but  regional  changes  in  river  floods  are  more  uncertain  than  changes  in  pluvial  floods 
because complex hydrological processes, including land cover and human water management are involved. 
{Box 8.2, 8.2.2.1, 8.3.1, 10.4.1, 11.5, 11.6, 11.9, 12.4, 12.5.1, Atlas.3.1, Interactive Atlas}  
 
*Wind:* Observed mean wind speed is decreasing over most land areas where observational coverage is high 
(medium  confidence).  It  is  likely  that  the  global  proportion  of  major  tropical  cyclone  (TC)  intensities 
(Categories 3–5) over the past four decades has increased. The proportion of intense TCs, average peak TC 
wind speeds, and peak wind speeds of the most intense TCs will increase on the global scale with increasing 
global warming (high confidence). {11.7.1} 
 
*Snow and ice:* Many aspects of the cryosphere either have seen significant changes in the recent past or will 
see them during the 21st century (high confidence). Glaciers will continue to shrink and permafrost to thaw in 
all regions where they are present (high confidence). Also, it is virtually certain that snow cover will experience 
a  decline  over  most  land  regions  during  the  21st  century,  in  terms  of  water  equivalent,  extent  and  annual 
duration.  There  is  high  confidence  that  the  global  warming-induced  earlier  onset  of  spring  snowmelt  and 
increased melting of glaciers have already contributed to seasonal changes in streamflow in high-latitude and 
low-elevation  mountain  catchments.  Nevertheless,  it  is  very  likely  that  some  high-latitude  regions  will 
experience an increase in winter snow water equivalent due to the effect of increased snowfall prevailing over 
warming-induced increased snowmelt. {TS.2.5, Box 8.2, 8.2.2.1, 8.3.1, 9.4, 9.5.1, 9.5.2, 12.4, Atlas}  
 
*Coastal and oceanic:* There is high confidence that SST will increase in all oceanic regions, excepting the 
North Atlantic. Regional sea-level change has been the main driver of changes in extreme sea levels across the 
quasi-global tide gauge network over the 20th century (high confidence). With the exception of a few regions 
with substantial land uplift, relative sea-level rise is very likely to virtually certain (depending on the region) 
to  continue  along  the  21st  century,  contributing  to  increased  coastal  flooding  in  low-lying  areas  (high 
confidence) and coastal erosion along most sandy coasts (high confidence) over the 21st century. In the open 
ocean,  acidification,  changes  in  sea  ice  and  deoxygenation  have  already  emerged  in  many  areas  (high 
confidence). Marine heatwaves (MWHs) are also expected to increase around the globe over the 21st century 
(high confidence). {TS.2.4, Box 9.2, 9.2.1.1, 9.6, 9.6.4, 9.6.4.2, 12.4} 
 
*Other variables and concurrent CID changes:* It is virtually certain that atmospheric CO2 and oceanic pH 
will increase in all climate scenarios, until net zero CO2 emissions are achieved (TS.2.2). In nearly all regions, 
there  is  low  confidence  in  changes  in  hail,  ice  storms,  severe  storms,  dust  storms,  heavy  snowfall,  and 
avalanches, although this does not indicate that these CIDs will not be affected by climate change. For such 
CIDs,  observations  are  often  short-term  or  lack  homogeneity,  and  models  often  do  not  have  sufficient 
resolution  or  accurate  parametrizations  to  adequately  simulate  them  over  climate  change  time  scales.  The 
probability of compound events has increased in the past due to human-induced climate change and will likely 
continue to increase with further global warming, including for concurrent heat waves and droughts, compound 
flooding and the possibility of connected sectors experiencing multiple regional extreme events at the same 
time (for example, in multiple breadbaskets) (high confidence). {5.3.4.2, 11.8, Box 11.3, Box 11.4, 12.4}  
 

### TS.4.3.2  Region-by-Region Changes in Climatic Impact-Drivers 
 
This section provides a continental synthesis of changes in CIDs, some examples of which are presented in 
Figure TS.25. 
 
With 2°C global warming, and as early as the mid-21st century, a wide range of CIDs, particularly related to 
the water cycle and storms, are expected to show simultaneous region-specific changes relative to recent past 
with high or medium confidence. In a number of regions (Southern Africa, the Mediterranean, North Central 
America,  Western  North  America,  the  Amazon  regions,  South  Western  South  America,  and  Australia), 
increases in  one or more of drought, aridity and fire weather (high confidence) will affect a wide range of 
sectors,  including  agriculture,  forestry,  health  and  ecosystems.  In  another  group  of  regions  (Northwestern, 
Central  and  Eastern  North  America,  Arctic  regions,  Northwestern  South  America,  Northern  and  Central 
Western Europe, Siberia, Central, South and East Asia, Southern Australia and New Zealand),  decreases in 
snow and ice or increases in pluvial/river flooding (high confidence) will affect sectors such as winter tourism, 
energy production, river transportation, and infrastructure. {11.9, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, Table 12.2}

#### TS.4.3.2.1  Africa 
 
> Additional regional changes in Africa, besides those described in TS.4.3.1, include a projected decrease in 
> total precipitation in the northernmost and southernmost regions (high confidence), with West and East Africa 
> each having a west-to-east pattern of decreasing-to-increasing precipitation (medium confidence). Increases in 
> heavy precipitation that can lead to pluvial floods (high confidence) are projected for most African regions, 
> even  as  increasing  dry  CIDs  (aridity,  hydrological,  agricultural  and  ecological  droughts,  fire  weather)  are 
> projected  in  the  western  part  of  West  Africa,  North  Africa,  South  Africa  and  the  Mediterranean  regions 
> (medium to high confidence). {8.4, 11.3, 11.6, 11.9, 12.4, Atlas.4} 

In addition to the main changes summarized above and in TS.4.3.1, additional details per CID are given below. 
 
*Heat  and  cold:*  Observed  and  projected  increases  in  mean  temperature  and  a  shift  toward  heat  extreme 
characteristics are broadly similar to the generic pattern described in TS.4.3.1. {2.3.1.1.2, 11.3, 11.9, 12.4.1.1, 
Atlas.4.2, Atlas.4.4} 
 
*Wet and dry:* Mean precipitation changes have been observed over Africa, but the historical trends are not 
spatially coherent (high confidence). Northern East Africa, Eastern Southern Africa and Central Africa have 
experienced  a  decline  in rainfall  since  about  1980  and  parts  of West  Africa  an increase  (high  confidence). 
Increases in the frequency and/or the intensity of heavy rainfall have been observed in Eastern and Western 
Southern Africa, and the eastern Mediterranean region (medium confidence). Increasing trends in river flood 
occurrences can be identified beyond 1980 in Eastern and Western Southern Africa (medium confidence) and 
West Africa (high confidence). However, Northern Africa and Western Southern Africa are likely to have a 
reduction in precipitation. Over West Africa, rainfall is projected to decrease in the Western Sahel subregion 
and  increase  along  the  Guinea  Coast  subregion  (medium  confidence).  Rainfall  is  likely  to  reduce  over  the 
western part of East Africa but increase in the eastern part of the region (medium confidence). {8.3.1.6, 11.4, 
11.9, 12.4.1.2, Atlas.4.2, Atlas.4.5, Interactive Atlas} 
 
Precipitation declines and aridity trends in West Africa, Central Africa, Southern Africa and the Mediterranean 
co-occur  with  trends  towards  increased  agricultural  and  ecological  droughts  in  the  same  regions  (medium 
confidence). Trends towards increased hydrological droughts have been observed in the Mediterranean (high 
confidence) and West Africa (medium confidence). These trends correspond with projected regional increases 
in aridity and fire weather conditions (high confidence). {8.3.1.6, 8.4.1.6, 11.6, 11.9, 12.4.1.2} 
 
*Wind:* Mean wind, extreme winds and the wind energy potential in North Africa and the Mediterranean are 
projected  to  decrease  across  all  scenarios  (high  confidence).  Over  West  Africa  and  South  Africa,  a  future 
significant  increase  in  wind  speed  and  wind  energy  potential  is  projected  (medium  confidence).  There  is  a 
projected decrease in the frequency of tropical cyclones making landfall over Madagascar, Eastern Southern 
Africa and East Africa (medium confidence). {12.4.1.3} 
 
*Snow and ice:* There is high confidence that African glaciers and snow have very significantly decreased in 
the last decades and that this trend will continue in the 21st century. {12.4.1.4}  
 
*Coastal and oceanic:* Relative sea level has increased at a higher rate than GMSL around Africa over the last 
3 decades. The present day 1-in-100-years Extreme Total Water Level (ETWL) is between 0.1 m and 1.2 m 
around Africa, with values around 1 m or above along the South West, South East and Central East coasts. 
Satellite-derived shoreline retreat rates up to 1 m yr–1 have been observed around the continent from 1984 to 
2015, except in Southeastern Africa, which has experienced a shoreline progradation (growth) rate of 0.1 m 
yr–1 over the same period. {12.4.1.5} 

#### TS.4.3.2.2  Asia 

Due  to  the  high  climatological  and  geographical  heterogeneity  of  Asia,  the  assessment  findings  below  are 
summarised over five sub-continental areas comprising one or more of the AR6 WG I reference regions (Box 
TS.12): East Asia (EAS+ECA), North Asia (WSB+ESB+RFE), South Asia (SAS+TIB), Southeast Asia (SEA) 
and Southwest Asia (ARP+WCA).  
 
> Additional regional changes in Asia, besides those features described in TS.4.3.1, include historical trends of 
> annual  precipitation  that  show  considerable  regional  differences  (high  confidence).  East  Asian  Monsoon 
> precipitation has changed, with drying in the north and wetting in the south since the 1950s, and annual mean 
> precipitation totals very likely have increased over most territories of North Asia since the mid-1970s (high 
> confidence).  South  Asian  summer  monsoon  precipitation  decreased  over  several  areas  since  the  mid-20th 
> century  (high  confidence)  but  is  likely  to  increase  during  the  21st  century,  with  enhanced  interannual 
> variability. 
>  
> Increases in precipitation and rivers floods are projected over much of Asia: in the annual mean precipitation 
> in East, North, South and Southeast Asia (high confidence); for extremes in East, South, West Central, North 
> and Southeast Asia (high confidence) and Arabian Peninsula (medium confidence); and for river floods in East, 
> South and  Southeast  Asia and  East  Siberia  (medium confidence).  Aridity in  East  and  West  Central  Asia is 
> projected to increase, especially beyond the middle of the 21st century and global warming levels beyond 2℃, 
> (medium  confidence).  Fire  weather  seasons  are  projected  to  lengthen  and  intensify  everywhere  except 
> Southeast Asia, Tibetan Plateau and Arabian Peninsula (medium confidence). 
>  
> There is a large uncertainty in the future continuation of observed decreasing trends in surface wind speeds in 
> Asia (high confidence), with medium confidence that mean wind speeds will decrease in North Asia, East Asia 
> and Tibetan Plateau and that tropical cyclones will have decreasing frequency and increasing intensity overall 
> in Southeast and East Asia. 
>  
> Over North Asia, increases in permafrost temperature and its thawing have been observed over recent decades 
> (high confidence). Future projections indicate continuing decline in seasonal snow duration, glacial mass, and 
> permafrost area by mid-century (high confidence). Snow-covered areas and snow volumes will decrease in 
> most  regions  of  the  Hindu  Kush  Himalaya  during the  21st  century  and  snowline  elevations  will  rise  (high 
> confidence) and glacier volumes are likely to decline with greater mass loss in higher CO2 emissions scenarios. 
> Heavy snowfall is increasing in East Asia and North Asia (medium confidence) but with limited evidence on 
> future changes in hail and snow avalanches.  
>  
> {2.3, 8.3, 8.4, 9.5, 9.6, 10.6, Box 10.4, 11.4, 11.5, 11.7, 11.9, 12.4.2, Atlas.3.1, Atlas.5, Atlas.5.2, Atlas.5.3, 
> Atlas.5.4, Atlas.5.5, Box TS.13} 

In addition to the main changes summarized above and in TS.4.3.1, further details are given below. 
 
*Heat and cold:* Over all regions of Asia, observed and projected increases in mean temperature and a  shift 
toward  heat  extreme  characteristics  are  broadly  similar  to  the  generic  pattern  described  in  TS.4.3.1.  Over 
Southeast  Asia annual mean  surface  temperature  will  likely  increase  by  a  slightly  smaller amount than  the 
global average. {Atlas.5.4.4} 
 
*Wet and dry:* Over East Asia, historical trends of annual precipitation show considerable regional differences 
but with increases over northwest China and South Korea (high confidence). Daily precipitation extremes have 
increased over part of the region (high confidence). Extreme hydrological drought frequency has increased in 
a region extending from southwest to northeast China, with projected increases of agricultural and ecological 
drought for 4°C GWL and fire weather for 2°C and above (medium confidence). {8.3.2, 8.4.2, 11.4.4, 11.4.5, 
11.9, 12.4.2.2, Atlas.5.1.2} 
 
Over North Asia, annual mean precipitation totals have very likely increased, causing more intense flooding 
events,  and  there  is  medium  confidence  that  the  number  of  dry  days  has  decreased.  Concurrently total  soil 
moisture  is  projected  to  decline  extensively  (medium  confidence).  {8.3.1.3,  8.4.1.6,  11.4.5,  11.5.2,  11.5.5, 
12.4.2.2, Atlas.5.2.2} 
 
Over South Asia, the summer monsoon precipitation decreased over several areas since the mid-20th century 
(high confidence), while it increased in parts of the western HKH and decreased over eastern-central HKH 
(medium confidence) (Box TS.12). The frequency of heavy precipitation and flood events has increased over 
several areas during the last few decades (medium confidence). {8.3.1.3, 8.3.2.4.1, 8.4.1.5, 8.4.2.4.1, 10.6.3.3, 
10.6.3.5, 10.6.3.6, 10.6.3.8, Cross-Chapter Box 10.4, 11.4.1, 11.4.2, 11.4.5, 11.5.5, 12.4.2.2, Box 10.4, Atlas 
5.3.2} 
 
Over  Southeast  Asia,  mean  precipitation trends  are  not  spatially coherent  or consistent  across  datasets  and 
seasons  (high  confidence).  Most  of  the  region  has  experienced  an  increase  in  rainfall  intensity  but  with  a 
reduced number of wet days (medium confidence). Rainfall is projected to increase in the northern parts of 
Southeast Asia and decrease in areas in the Maritime Continent (medium confidence). {8.4.1, 11.4.2, 11.5.5, 
11.9, 12.4.2.2, Atlas.3.1, Atlas.5.4.2, Atlas.5.4.4} 
  
Over Southwest Asia, an observed annual precipitation decline over the Arabian Peninsula since the 1980s of 
6.3  mm  per  decade  is  contrasted  with  observed  increases  between  1.3  mm  and  4.8  mm  per  decade  during 
1960–2013 over the elevated part of eastern West Central Asia (very high confidence), along with an increase 
of  the  frequency  and  intensity  of  extreme  precipitation.  {Figure  8.19,  Figure  8.20,  8.3.1.6,  8.4.1.6,  Table 
11.2A, 11.9, 12.4.2.2, Atlas.5.5} 
 
*Wind:*  Over  East  Asia,  the  terrestrial  near-surface  wind  speed  has  decreased  and  is  projected  to  decrease 
further in the future (medium confidence). Since the mid 1980’s, there has been an increase in the number and 
intensification rate of intense TCs (medium confidence), with a significant northwestward shift in tracks and a 
northward shift in their average latitude, increasing exposure over East China, the Korean Peninsula and the 
Japanese Archipelago (medium confidence). {11.7.1, 12.4.2.3} 
 
Over North Asia there is medium confidence for a decreasing trend in wind speed during 1979–2018 and for 
projected  continuing  decreases  of  terrestrial  near-surface  wind  speed  (medium  confidence).  {2.3.1.4.4, 
12.4.2.3} 
 
Over Southeast Asia, although there is no significant long-term trend in the number of TC, fewer but more 
extreme TCs have affected the Philippines during 1951–2013. {11.7.4, 12.4.2.4} 
 
*Snow  and  ice:*  Over  East  Asia,  decreases  have  been  observed  in  the  frequency  and  increases  in  the  mean 
intensity of snowfall in north-western, north-eastern and south-eastern China and the eastern Tibetan Plateau 
since  the  1960s.  Heavy  snowfall  is  projected  to  occur  more  frequently  in  some  parts  of  Japan  (medium 
confidence). {12.4.2.4, Atlas.5.1.2} 
 
Over North Asia, seasonal snow duration and extent have decreased in recent decades (high confidence), and 
maximum snow depth likely has increased since the mid-1970s, particularly over south of the Russian-Far-
East. {2.3.2.5, 8.3.1.7.2, 9.5, 12.4.2.4, Atlas.5.2, Atlas.5.4} 
 
Over South Asia, snow-cover has reduced over most of the  HKH since the early 21st century, and glaciers 
have thinned, retreated, and lost mass since the 1970s (high confidence) although the Karakoram glaciers have 
either slightly gained mass or are in an approximately balanced state (medium confidence). {8.3.1.7.1, Cross-
Chapter Box 10.4} 
 
Over  Southwest  Asia,  mountain  permafrost  degradation  at  high  altitudes  has  increased  the  instability  of 
mountain slopes in the past decade (medium confidence). More than 60% of glacier mass in the Caucasus is 
projected to disappear under RCP8.5 emissions by the end of the 21st century (medium confidence). {9.5.1, 
9.5.3, 12.4.2.4} 
 
*Coastal and oceanic:* Over the last three decades, relative sea level has increased at a rate higher than GMSL 
around Asia (high confidence). Gross coastal area loss and shoreline retreat has been observed over 1984–
2015, but with localized shoreline progradation in the Russian Far East, East and Southeast Asia. {12.4.2.5} 
 
Projections  show  that  regional-mean  sea level continues to rise  (high confidence), ranging  from  0.4–0.5 m 
under SSP1-2.6 to 0.8–1.0 m under SSP5-8.5 for 2081–2100 relative to 1995–2014 (median values). This will 
contribute to more frequent coastal flooding and higher Extreme Total Water Level (ETWL) in low-lying areas 
and coastal erosion along sandy beaches (high confidence). There is high confidence that compound effects of 
climate change, land subsidence, and human factors will lead to higher flood levels and prolonged inundation 
in the Mekong Delta and other Asian coasts. {9.6.1, 9.6.3, 12.4.2.5} 

#### TS.4.3.2.3  Australasia 
 
> Additional regional changes in Australasia, besides those features described in TS.4.3.1, include a significant 
> decrease  in  April  to  October  rainfall  in  southwest  Western  Australia,  observed  from  1910  to  2019  and 
> attributable to human influence (high confidence), which is very likely to continue in future. Agricultural and 
> ecological  and  hydrological  droughts  have  increased  over  southern  Australia  (medium  confidence),  and 
> meteorological droughts have decreased over northern and central Australia (medium confidence). Relative 
> sea  level  has  increased  over  the  period  1993–2018  at  a  rate  higher  than  GMSL  around  Australasia  (high 
> confidence). Sandy shorelines have retreated around the region, except in southern Australia, where a shoreline 
> progradation rate of 0.1 m yr–1 has been observed. In the future, heavy precipitation and pluvial flooding are 
> very likely to increase over northern Australia and central Australia, and they are likely to increase elsewhere 
> in Australasia for global warming levels (GWLs) exceeding 2°C and with medium confidence for a 2°C GWL. 
> Agricultural  and  ecological  droughts  are  projected  to  increase  in  southern  and  eastern  Australia  (medium 
> confidence) for a 2°C GWL. Fire weather is projected to increase throughout Australia (high confidence) and 
> New Zealand (medium confidence). Snowfall is expected to decrease throughout the region at high altitudes 
> in  both  Australia  (high  confidence) and  New  Zealand (medium  confidence),  with  glaciers  receding  in  New 
> Zealand (high confidence). {11.4, Table 11.6, 12.3, 12.4.3, Atlas.6.4, Atlas.6.5} 

 
In addition to the main changes summarized above and in TS.4.3.1, further details are given below. 
 
*Heat  and  cold:*  Observed  and  projected  increases  in  mean  temperature  and  a  shift  toward  heat  extreme 
characteristics are broadly similar to the generic pattern described in TS.4.3.1. {11.9, 12.4.3.1, Atlas.6} 
 
*Wet and dry:* There is medium confidence that heavy precipitation has increased in northern Australia since 
1950.  Annual  mean  precipitation  is  projected  to  increase  in  the  south  and  west  of  New  Zealand  (medium 
confidence) and is projected to decrease in southwest western Australia (high confidence), eastern Australia 
(medium confidence), and in the north and east of New Zealand (medium confidence) for a GWL of 2°C. There 
is medium confidence that river flooding will increase in New Zealand and Australia, with higher increases in 
northern  Australia.  Aridity  is  projected  to  increase  with  medium  confidence  in  southern  Australia  (high 
confidence in southwest Western Australia), eastern Australia (medium confidence) and in the north and east 
of New Zealand (medium confidence) for GWLs around 2°C. {11.4, Table 11.6, 11.9, 12.4.3.2, Atlas.6.2} 
 
*Wind:* Mean wind speeds are projected to increase in parts of northeastern Australia (medium confidence) by 
the end of the 21st century, under high CO2 emissions scenarios. TCs in north eastern and north Australia are 
projected to decrease in number (high confidence) but increase in intensity except for ‘east coast lows’ (low 
confidence). {12.4.3.3} 
 
*Snow and ice:* Observations in Australia show that the snow season length has decreased by 5% in the last 
five  decades.  Furthermore,  the date  of  peak  snowfall in  Australia  has  advanced by  11  days over  the  last  5 
decades. Glacier ice volume in New Zealand has decreased by 33% from 1977 to 2018. {12.4.3.4, Atlas.6.2} 
 
*Coastal and oceanic:* Observed changes in marine heat waves (MHWs) over the 20th century in the region 
show an increase in their occurrence frequency, except along the south east coast of New Zealand, an increase 
in duration per event, and the total number of MHW days per decade, with the change being stronger in the 
Tasman  Sea  than  elsewhere.  The  present  day  1-in-100-year  ETWL  is  between  0.5–2.5  m  around  most  of 
Australia, except the northwestern coast where 1-in-100-year ETWL can be as high as 6 m–7 m. {Box 9.1,

#### TS.4.3.2.4   Central and South America 
 
> Additional  regional  changes  in  Central  and  South  America,  besides  those  features  described  in  TS.4.3.1, 
> include  increases  in  mean  and  extreme  precipitation  in  Southeastern  South  America  since  the  1960s  (high 
> confidence)  (TS.4.2.3).  Decreasing  trends  in  mean  precipitation  and  increasing  trends  in  agricultural  and 
> ecological  drought  are  observed  over  Northeastern  South  America  (medium confidence).  The intensity  and

> America,  Southern  South  America,  Northern  South  America,  South  American  Monsoon  and  Northeastern 
> South  America  (medium  confidence)  for  a  2°C  GWL  and  above.  Increases  of  agricultural  and  ecological 
> drought are projected in South America Monsoon and Southern South America, and fire weather is projected 
> to increase over several regions (Northern South America, the South American Monsoon, Northeastern South 
> America and Southwestern South America) (high confidence). {8.3, 8.4, 11.3, 11.4, 11.9, Table 11.13, Table 
> 11.14, Table 11.15, 12.4.4.2, Atlas.7.1, Atlas.7.2} 

 
In addition to the main changes summarized above and in TS.4.3.1, further details are given below. 
 
*Heat  and  cold:*  Observed  and  projected  increases  in  mean  temperature  and  a  shift  toward  heat  extreme 
characteristics are broadly similar to the generic pattern described in TS.4.3.1. {11.3.2, 11.3.5, Table 11.13, 
12.4.4.1, Atlas.7.1.2, Atlas.7.2.2, Atlas.7.2.4} 
  
*Wet and dry:* Mean precipitation is projected to change in a dipole pattern with increases in Northwestern 
and  Southeastern  South  America  and  decreases  in  Northeastern  and  Southwestern  South  America  (high 
confidence)  with  further  decreases  in  Northern  South  America  and  South  Central  America  (medium 
confidence). In Northern South America and South Central America, aridity and agricultural and ecological 
droughts are increasing with medium confidence. Fire weather is projected to increase over Southern Central 
America and Southern South America with medium confidence. {8.3.1.3, 8.4.2.4.5, 11.4.2, 11.9, Table 11.14, 
Table 11.15, 12.4.4.2, Atlas.7.2.2, Atlas.7.2.4} 
 
*Wind:*  Climate  projections  indicate  an  increase in  mean  wind  speed  and in  wind  power  potential  over  the 
Amazonian  region  (Northern  South  America,  South  American  Monsoon,  Northeastern  South  America) 
(medium confidence). {12.4.4.3} 
 
*Snow and ice:* Glacier volume loss and permafrost thawing will likely continue in the Andes Cordillera under 
all climate scenarios, causing important reductions in river flow and potentially high-magnitude glacial lake 
outburst floods. {9.5.1.1, 12.4.4.4} 
 
*Coastal and oceanic:* Around Central and South America, relative sea level has increased at a higher rate than 
GMSL in the South Atlantic and the subtropical North Atlantic, and at a rate lower than GMSL in the East 
Pacific over the last 3 decades. The present day 1-in-100-years ETWL is highest in Southern and Southwestern 
South America subregions, where it can be as large as 5 to 6 m. Satellite observations for 1984–2015 show 
shoreline retreat rates along the sandy coasts of Southern Central America, Southeastern South America and 
Southern  South  America,  while  shoreline  progradation  rates  have  been  observed  in  Northwestern  South 
America and Northern South America. Over the period 1982–2016, the coastlines experienced at least one 
MHW  per  year,  and  more  along  the  Pacific  coast  of  North  Central  America  and  the  Atlantic  coast  of 
Southeastern South America. {12.4.4.5} 
 
 
#### TS.4.3.2.5   Europe 
 

> Additional  regional  changes  in  Europe,  besides  those  features  described  in  TS.4.3.1,  include  observed 
> increases in pluvial flooding in northern Europe and hydrological and agricultural/ecological droughts in the 
> Mediterranean (high confidence), which have been  attributed to human contribution with  high and medium 
> confidence, respectively. Increased mean precipitation amounts at high latitudes in boreal winter and reduced 
> summer precipitation in southern Europe are projected starting from a 2°C GWL (high confidence). Aridity, 
> agricultural and hydrological droughts and fire weather conditions will increase in the Mediterranean region 
> starting from 2°C GWL (high confidence). Pluvial flooding will increase everywhere with  high confidence 
> except for medium confidence in the Mediterranean; in Western and Central Europe this also applies to river 
> flooding  starting  from  a  2°C  GWL  (high  confidence).  Most  periglacial  processes  in  Northern  Europe  are 
> projected to disappear by the end of the 21st century, even for a low warming scenario (medium confidence). 
> {8.3, 11.3, 11.9, 12.4.5, 12.5.2, Atlas.8.2, Atlas.8.4} 

 
In addition to the main changes summarized above and in TS.4.3.1, further details are given below. 
 
*Heat  and  cold:*  Observed  and  projected  increases  in  mean  temperature  and  a  shift  toward  heat  extreme 
characteristics are broadly similar to the generic pattern described in TS.4.3.1. {11.3, 11.9, 12.4.5.1, 12.5.2, 
Atlas.8.2, Atlas.8.4} 
 
*Wet  and  dry:*  There  is  medium  confidence  that  annual  mean  precipitation  in  Northern  Europe,  West  and 
Central Europe and Eastern Europe has increased since the early 20th century and high confidence for extreme 
precipitation. In the European Mediterranean,  the magnitude and sign of observed land precipitation trends 
depend on time period and  exact study region (medium confidence). There is  medium confidence that river 
floods will decrease in Northern, Eastern and Southern Europe for high warming levels. {8.3.1.3, 11.3, 11.9, 
12.4.5.2, Atlas.8.2, Atlas.8.4} 
  
*Wind:* Mean wind speed over land has decreased (medium confidence), but the role of human-induced climate 
change  has  not  been  established.  There  is  high  confidence  that  mean  wind  speeds  will  decrease  in 
Mediterranean areas and medium confidence of such decreases in Northern Europe for GWLs exceeding 2°C. 
The frequency of Medicanes (tropical-like cyclones in the Mediterranean) is projected to decrease (medium 
confidence). {11.9, 12.4.5.3} 
 
*Snow and ice:* In the Alps, snow cover will decrease below elevations of 1500–2000 m throughout the 21st 
century (high confidence). A reduction of glacier ice volume is projected in the European Alps and Scandinavia 
with high confidence and with medium confidence for the timing and mass change rates. {12.4.5.4, 9.5.2} 
 
*Coastal and oceanic:* Over the last three decades, relative sea level has increased at a lower rate than GMSL 
in the sub-polar North Atlantic coasts of Europe. The present day 1-in-100-years ETWL is between 0.5–1.5 m 
in the Mediterranean basin and 2.5–5.0 m in the western Atlantic European coasts, around the United Kingdom 
and along the North Sea coast, and lower at 1.5–2.5 m along the Baltic Sea coast. Satellite-derived shoreline 
change estimates over 1984–2015 indicate shoreline retreat rates of around 0.5 m yr–1 along the sandy coasts 
of  Central  Europe  and  the Mediterranean  and  more  or  less  stable  shorelines  in  Northern  Europe.  Over the 
period 1982–2016, the coastlines of Europe experienced on average more than 2.0 MHW per year, with the 
eastern Mediterranean and Scandinavia experiencing 2.5–3 MHWs per year. {12.4.5.5} 
 
 
#### TS.4.3.2.6  North America 
 

> Additional regional changes in North America, besides those features described in TS.4.3.1, include changes 
> in North American wet and dry CIDs, which are largely organized by the northeast (more wet) to southwest 
> (more dry) pattern of mean precipitation change, although heavy precipitation increases are widespread (high 
> confidence). Increasing evaporative demand will expand agricultural and ecological drought and fire weather 
> (particularly in summertime) in Central North America, Western North America and North Central America 
> (from medium to high confidence). Severe wind storms, tropical cyclones, and dust storms in North America 
> are shifting toward more extreme characteristics (medium confidence), and both observations and projections 
> point to strong changes in the seasonal and geographic range of snow and ice conditions in the coming decades 
> (very high confidence). General findings for relative sea level, coastal flooding and erosion will not apply for 
> areas with substantial land uplift around the Hudson Bay and Southern Alaska. {8.4, 11.4, 11.5, 11.7, 11.9, 
> 12.4, Atlas.9.4} 

In addition to the main changes summarized above and in TS.4.3.1, further details are given below. 
 
*Heat  and  cold:*  Observed  and  projected  increases  in  mean  temperature  and  a  shift  toward  heat  extreme 
characteristics are broadly similar to the generic pattern described in TS.4.3.1. {11.3, 11.9, 12.4.6.1, Atlas.9.2, 
Atlas.9.4} 
 
*Wet and dry:* Annual precipitation increased over parts of Eastern and Central North America during 1960–
2015 (high confidence) and has decreased in parts of southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico 
(medium confidence). River floods are projected to increase for all North American regions other than north 
Central America (medium confidence). {8.4.2.4, 11.4, 11.5, 11.9, 12.4.6.2, Atlas.9.2, Atlas.9.4} 
 
Agricultural  and  ecological  drought  increases  have  been  observed  in  Western  North  America  (medium 
confidence),  and  aridity  is  projected  to  increase  in  the  southwestern  United  States  and  Northern  Central 
America,  with  lower  summer  soil  moisture  across  much  of  the  continental  interior  (medium  confidence). 
{8.4.1, 11.6.2, 12.4.6.2} 
 
*Wind:* Projections indicate a greater number of the most intense TCs, with slower translation speeds and higher 
rainfall  potential  for  Mexico’s  Pacific  Coast,  the  Gulf  Coast  and  the  United  States  East  Coast  (medium 
confidence). Mean wind speed and wind power potential are projected to decrease in Western North America 
(high confidence), with differences between global and regional models lending  low confidence elsewhere. 
{11.4, 11.7, 12.4.6.3} 
 
*Snow and ice:* It is very likely that some high-latitude regions will experience an increase in winter snow water 
equivalent, due to the snowfall increase prevailing over the warming trend. At sustained GWLs between 3℃ 
and  5℃,  nearly  all  glacial  mass  in  Western  Canada  and  Western  North  America  will  disappear  (medium 
confidence). {9.5.1, 9.5.3, 12.4.6.4, Atlas.9.4} 
 
*Coastal and oceanic:* Around North America, relative sea level has increased over the last 3 decades at a rate 
lower than GMSL in the subpolar North Atlantic and in the East Pacific, while it has increased at a rate higher 
than GMSL in the subtropical North Atlantic. Observations indicate that episodic coastal flooding is increasing 
along many coastlines in North America. Shoreline retreat rates of around 1 m yr–1 have been observed during 
1984–2015  along  the  sandy  coasts  of  Northwestern  North  America  and  Northern  Central  America,  while 
portions of the United States Gulf Coast have seen a retreat rate approaching 2.5 m yr–1. Sandy shorelines 
along Eastern North America and Western North America have remained more or less stable during 1984–
2014, but a shoreline progradation rate of around 0.5 m yr–1 has been observed in Northeastern North America. 
{12.4.6.5} 
 
 
#### TS.4.3.2.7  Small Islands 
 

> Additional regional changes in Small Islands, besides those features described in TS.4.3.1, include  a likely 
> decrease in rainfall during boreal summer in the Caribbean and in some parts of the Pacific islands poleward 
> of 20° latitude in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. These drying trends will likely continue in 
> coming decades. Fewer but more intense tropical cyclones are projected starting from a 2°C GWL (medium 
> confidence). {9.6, 11.3, 11.4, 11.7, 11.9, 12.4.7, Atlas.10.2, Atlas.10.4, Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.2} 

 
In addition to the main changes summarized above and in TS.4.3.1, further details are given below. 
 
*Heat and cold:* It is very likely that most Small Islands have warmed over the period of instrumental records, 
and  continued  temperature  increases  in  the  21st  century  will  further  increase  heat  stress  in  these  regions. 
{11.3.2, 11.9, 12.4.7.1, Atlas.10.2, Atlas.10.4, Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.2} 
 
*Wet  and  dry:*  Observed  and  projected  rainfall  trends  vary  spatially  across  the  Small  Islands.  Higher 
evapotranspiration under a warming climate can partially offset future increases or amplify future reductions 
in rainfall resulting in increased aridity as well as more severe agricultural and ecological drought in the Small 
Islands (medium confidence). {11.4.2, 11.9, 12.4.7.2, Atlas.10.2, Atlas.10.4, Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1} 
 
*Wind:*  Global  changes  indicate  that  Small  Islands  will  face  fewer  but  more  intense  TCs,  with  spatial 
inconsistency  in  projections  given  poleward  shifts  in  TC  tracks  (medium  confidence).  {11.7.1.2,  11.7.1.5, 
12.4.7.3} 
 
*Coastal and oceanic:* Continued relative sea level rise is very likely in the ocean around Small Islands and, 
along with storm surges and waves, will exacerbate coastal inundation with the potential to increase saltwater 
intrusion into aquifers in small islands. Shoreline retreat is projected along sandy coasts of most small islands 
(high confidence). {9.6.3.3, 12.4.7.4, Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1} 
 
 
#### TS.4.3.2.8   Polar 
 

> It is virtually certain that surface warming in the Arctic will continue to be more pronounced than the global 
> average  warming  over  the  21st  century.  An  intensification  of  the  polar  water  cycle  will  increase  mean 
> precipitation, with precipitation intensity becoming stronger and more likely to be rainfall rather than snowfall 
> (high confidence). Permafrost warming, loss of seasonal snow cover, and glacier melt will be widespread (high 
> confidence). There is high confidence that both the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets have lost mass since 
> 1992 and will continue to lose mass throughout this century under all emissions scenarios. Relative sea level 
> and coastal flooding are projected to increase in areas other than regions with substantial land uplift (medium 
> confidence). {2.3, 3.4, 4.3, 4.5, 7.4, 8.2, 8.4, Box 8.2, 9.5, 12.4.9, Atlas.11.1, Atlas.11.2}  

 
In addition to the main changes summarized above and in TS.4.3.1, further details are given below. 
 
*Heat  and  cold:*  Changes  in  Antarctica  showed  larger  spatial  variability,  with  very  likely  warming  in  the 
Antarctic Peninsula since the 1950s and no overall trend in East Antarctica. Less warming and weaker polar 
amplification are projected as very likely over the Antarctic than in the Arctic, with a weak polar amplification 
projected as very likely by the end of the 21st century. {4.3.1, 4.5.1, 7.4.4, 12.4.9.1, Atlas.11.1, Atlas.11.2} 
Wet and dry: Recent decades have seen a general decrease in Arctic aridity (high confidence), with increased 
moisture transport leading to higher precipitation, humidity and streamflow and a corresponding decrease in 
dry days. Antarctic precipitation showed a positive trend during the 20th century. The water cycle is projected 
to intensify in both polar regions, leading to higher precipitation totals (and a shift to more heavy precipitation) 
and higher fraction of precipitation falling as rain. In the Arctic, this will result in higher river flood potential 
and earlier meltwater flooding, altering seasonal characteristics of flooding (high confidence). A lengthening 
of the fire season (medium confidence) and encroachment of fire regimes into tundra regions (high confidence) 
are projected. {8.2.3, 8.4.1, Box 8.2, 9.4.1, 9.4.2, 12.4.9.2, Atlas.11.1, Atlas.11.2} 
 
*Wind:* There is medium confidence in mean wind decrease over the Russian Arctic and Arctic Northeast North 
America, but low confidence of changes in other Arctic regions and Antarctica. {12.4.9.3}  
 
*Snow and ice:* Reductions in spring snow cover extent have occurred across the Northern Hemisphere since 
at least 1978 (very high confidence). Permafrost warming and thawing have been widespread in the Arctic 
since the 1980s (high confidence), causing strong heterogeneity in surface conditions. There is high confidence 
in future glacier and ice sheet loss, permafrost warming, decreasing permafrost extent and decreasing seasonal 
duration and extent of snow cover in the Arctic. Decline in seasonal sea ice coverage along the majority of the 
Arctic  coastline  in  recent  decades  is  projected  to  continue,  contributing  to  an  increase  in  coastal  hazards 
(including open water storm surge, coastal erosion and flooding). {2.3.2, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, 9.4.1, 9.4.2, 9.5, 12.4.6, 
12.4.9, Atlas.11.2} 
  
*Coastal and oceanic:* Higher sea levels contribute to high confidence for projected increases of Arctic coastal 
flooding and higher coastal erosion (aided by sea ice loss) (medium confidence), with lower confidence for 
those regions with substantial land uplift (Arctic Northeast North America and Greenland). {12.4.9.5}  
 
 
#### TS.4.3.2.9   Ocean 
 
> The Indian Ocean, western equatorial Pacific Ocean and western boundary currents have warmed faster than 
> the  global  average  (very  high  confidence),  with  the  largest  changes  in  the  frequency  of  marine  heatwaves 
> (MHWs) projected in the western tropical Pacific and the Arctic Ocean (medium confidence). The Pacific and 
> Southern  Ocean  are  projected  to  freshen  and  the  Atlantic  to  become  more  saline  (medium  confidence). 
> Anthropogenic warming is very likely to further decrease ocean oxygen concentrations, and this deoxygenation 
> is  expected  to  persist  for  thousands  of  years  (medium  confidence).  Arctic  sea  ice  losses  are  projected  to 
> continue, leading to a practically ice-free Arctic in September by the end of the 21st century under high CO2 
> emissions scenarios (high confidence). {2.3, 5.3, 9.2, 9.3, Box 9.2, 12.4.8} 

 
In addition to the main changes summarized above and in TS.4.3.1, further details are given below. 
 
*Ocean  surface  temperature:*  The  Southern  Ocean,  the  eastern  equatorial  Pacific,  and  the  North  Atlantic 
Ocean have warmed more slowly than the global average or slightly cooled. Global warming of 2°C above 
1850–1900 levels would result in the exceedance of numerous hazard thresholds for pathogens, seagrasses, 
mangroves, kelp forests, rocky shores, coral reefs and other marine ecosystems (medium confidence). {9.2.13, 
12.4.8} 
 
*Marine heatwaves:* Moderate increases in MHW frequency are projected for mid-latitudes, and only small 
increases are projected for the Southern Ocean (medium confidence). Under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, permanent 
MHWs (more than 360 days per year) are projected to occur in the 21st century in parts of the tropical ocean, 
the Arctic Ocean and around 45°S; however, the occurrence of such permanent MHWs can be largely avoided 
under SSP1-2.6 scenario. {Box 9.2, 12.4.8} 
 
*Ocean acidity:* With the rising CO2 concentration, the ocean surface pH has declined globally over the past 
four decades (virtually certain). {2.3.3.5, 5.3.3.2, 12.4.8} 
 
*Ocean salinity:* At the basin scale, it is very likely that the Pacific and the Southern Ocean have freshened 
while the Atlantic has become more saline. {2.3.3.2, 9.2.2.2, 12.4.8} 
 
*Dissolved oxygen:* In recent decades, low oxygen zones in ocean ecosystems have expanded. {2.3.4.2, 5.3.3.2, 
12.4.8} 
 
*Sea ice:* Arctic perennial sea ice is being replaced by thin, seasonal ice, with earlier spring melt and delayed 
fall freeze up. There is no clear trend in the Antarctic sea ice area over the past few decades and low confidence 
in its future change. {2.3.2.1.1, 9.3.1.1, 12.4.8, 12.4.9} 
 
 
#### TS.4.3.2.10  Other Typological Domains 
 
> Some  types  of  regions  found  in  different  continents  face  common  climate  challenges  regardless  of  their 
> location. These include biodiversity hot spots that will very likely see even more extreme heat and droughts, 
> mountain areas where a projected raising in the freezing level height will alter snow and ice conditions (high 
> confidence), and tropical forests that are increasingly prone to fire weather (medium confidence). {Box 8.2, 
> 8.4, 9.5, 12.3, 12.4} 

 
Biodiversity hotspots located around the world will each face unique challenges in CID changes. Heat, drought 
and length of dry season, wildfire weather, sea surface temperature and deoxygenation are relevant drivers to 
terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and have marked increasing trends. {12.3, 12.4.10.1} 
 
Desert and semi-arid areas are strongly affected by CIDs such as extreme heat, drought and dust storms, with 
large-scale  aridity  trends  contributing  to  expanding  drylands  in  some  regions  (high  confidence).  {12.3, 
12.4.10.3} 
 
Average warming in mountain areas varies with elevation, but the pattern is not globally uniform (medium 
confidence).  Extreme  precipitation  is  projected  to  increase  in  major  mountainous  regions  (medium  to  high 
confidence  depending  on  location),  with  potential  cascading  consequences  of  floods,  landslides  and  lake 
outbursts in all scenarios (medium confidence). {Box 8.2, 8.4.1.5, 9.5.1.3, 9.5.3.3, 9.5.2.3, Cross-Chapter Box 
10.4, 11.5.5, 12.3, 12.4.1–12.4.6, 12.4.10.4} 
 
Most  tropical  forests  are  challenged  by  a  mix  of  emerging  warming  trends  that  are  particularly  large  in 
comparison  to  historical  variability  (medium  confidence).  Water  cycle  changes  bring  prolonged  drought, 
longer dry seasons, and increased fire weather to many tropical forests (medium confidence). {10.5, 12.3, 12.4}
